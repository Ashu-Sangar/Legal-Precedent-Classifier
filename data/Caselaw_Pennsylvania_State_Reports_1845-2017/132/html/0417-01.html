      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>After argument, the court, McPherson, J., filed the following opinion :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[236,452,1173,348]]]'>This action is intended to settle a doubt, whether the bond referred to in the deed of September 3, 1863, did not contain the names of some other persons than the children of the testator to whom he bequeathed this money; and whether, therefore, there may not be a conflict between the children and these possible beneficiaries, thus making it unsafe for the defendant to pay voluntarily in accordance with the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[236,808,1172,290]]]'>Several explanations of the facts may be conceived. One is, that no bond at all may have been given; but, while this finds some support in the absence of all external evidence about so valuable a paper, it need not be insisted upon. Assuming that a bond was given but has been lost, the question then is, who were the ultimate beneficiaries therein ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[233,1117,1175,605]]]'>1. The bond may have contained the names of other persons than the children of John Wolfersberger. The objections to this theory are, that the deed recites the names of no such persons ; that the natural heirs would thus be passed by without apparent reason; that a claim likely to have been carefully guarded has not been heard of for more than twenty-five years; and, specially, that such a supposition requires us to hold that, after the decedent had by deed given away this portion of his property to one set of persons, he still assumed to dispose of it by will to other and different persons. This presumes wrongdoing on his part, and is only to be adopted if no other reasonable explanation can be found.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-7" data-blocks='[["BL_444.7",444,[232,1730,1172,299]]]'>It might also be fairly argued that, even if the bond did contain the names of other persons than his children, yet it was testamentary in its character and was therefore revoked by his subsequent will. We lay no stress upon this suggestion, however, but mention it merely to indicate another method of avoiding the presumption of wrong-doing by the decedent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-8" data-blocks='[["BL_444.8",444,[232,2036,1167,144]]]'>2. The bond may have contained the names of the children. This is probable enough, would harmonize the deed, bond and will, and would relieve the case of difficulty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-9" data-blocks='[["BL_444.9",444,[230,2189,1169,196]],["BL_445.1",445,[205,391,1163,747]]]'>3. The bond may have contained no names at all of the ultimate beneficiaries, but merely followed the deed in declaring that the principal was to be paid after the widow’s death “ to those entitled thereto,” thus leaving them to be specified either <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>by the intestate laws or by John Wolfersberger’s will. This explanation seems to us much the most likely, and is the one we think should be adopted. It is in accord with the language of the deed, and with the almost universal custom which repeats in the conveyance which secures a bond the names of the obligees. It leaves to John Wolfersberger the full control of the principal sum, and does not require us to presume a gift to unknown and unnamed donees. It relieves us from concluding that the decedent gave by deed to one set of persons the right to this considerable sum, and afterwards attempted by will to wrongfully take it away and give it to others. And, finally, it keeps this money in its natural channel, leaving it to pass by his will to those whom presumably he would most wish to benefit, and from whom, so far as can be seen, be had no reason or desire to divert it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[204,1157,1162,401]]]'>One further question remains, viz.: the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, and this we think is undoubted. Clearly, the charge is imposed by the deed and not by the will; the will simply designates the persons who are to share it, after the death of the widow. But as the charge itself was created by contract in the lifetime of the decedent, and as the executor is expressly directed by the will to receive it, this suit is by the proper person and in the proper court.</p>
