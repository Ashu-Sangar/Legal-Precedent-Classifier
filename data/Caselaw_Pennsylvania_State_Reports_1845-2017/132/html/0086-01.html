L. 271, became a law, the courts of Philadelphia county adopted a rule of court providing that “plaintiff’s statement shall contain a specific averment of facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action.”- The statement filed in this case meets the requirements of this rule and of § 5, act of March 21, 1806, 4 Sm. L. 328. The precise date of the contract is specified, and a copy of the agreement is attached. Besides the date, a statement under the act of 1806 has no indispensable requirement which <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>is not made so by tbe act. Tbe cause of action must be set forth intelligibly so as to exhibit an available cause of action, but performance of conditions precedent, and everything beyond the defendant’s engagement to pay, may be omitted: Snevely v. Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20433" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 W. 433">9 W. 433</a>; Boyd v. Gordon, 6 S. &amp; R. 53; Reed v.

Sturgeon, 6 S. &amp; R. 26. The form of statement adopted in this case was commended in Morgan v.

While this statement does not contain an explicit averment extending to the last penny of the whole amount claimed, the plaintiff is as explicit as under the circumstances it was possible for him to be. The percentage to which he was entitled under the contract is set forth, but the amount of sales upon which the calculation was to be made was exclusively with the knowledge of the defendants, to whose books the plaintiff could not have access until the trial. The rule of pleading is that no greater particularity is required than the nature of the thing pleaded will conveniently admit: Stephen on Pleading, *367. As applied to the modern methods of conducting litigation, this rule relieves a pleader from stating particulars not supposed to be within the pleader’s knowledge : Bliss on Code Pleading, § 309. Consequently, less particularity is required when the facts lie more within the knowledge of the opposite party: Stephen on Pleading, *370; Bliss on Code Pleading, § 310. In ordering bills of particulars, the court, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, may require the month or the year only, when the precise day cannot be stated: Humphry v. Cottleyon, <a href="/cow/4/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Cow. 54" data-case-ids="2030944" data-case-paths="/cow/4/0054-01">4 Cow. 54</a>; Blackie v. Neilson, 6 Bos. (N.

By its entry tbe rights of the parties are in nowise concluded. The plaintiff is still at liberty to bring a new action, upon the payment of the costs. A writ of <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>error is never permitted to an entry of nonsuit. By statute, where a compulsory nonsuit has been entered at the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, and a motion to take the nonsuit off has been considered by the court in banc and refused, a writ of error is allowed, but in such case the action of the court is treated as a judgment upon a demurrer to the evidence. The present case does not come within the provisions of the statute, and if it did, the plaintiff has failed to bring himself within the requirements under which a writ of error is allowed to an order refusing to take off a nonsuit: Haverly v. Mercur, <a href="/pa/78/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="78 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1040380" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0257-01">78 Pa. 257</a>.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[251,889,1175,799]]]'>2. Th'e rule of court under which- the nonsuit was entered is as follows : “ Section 126 d. In default of such requisites, the statement or notice may be demurred to, or a rule may be had for a more specific statement or notice. On such demurrer, the court may give final judgment, or order a more specific statement or notice; and where such more specific statement or notice is ordered and not furnished, the court may enter a nonsuit or judgment by default, as the case may require.” Under the act of 1887, the requirement is “ for a concise statement of the plaintiff’s demand, as provided by the fifth section of the act of the twenty-first day of March, A. D. 1806.” The requisites of a statement under the act of 1806 are, that it shall “particularly specify the date of the promise.....on which the demand is founded, and the whole amount that he, she, or they believe is justly due to him, her, or them from the defendants.”</p>
    <p id="b116-9" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[249,1706,1173,643]]]'>3. It will thus be perceived that while the system of informal pleading prescribed by the act of 1806 was a departure from the technical formularies of the common law, it introduced, at least in one respect, a stricter requirement than that of common-law pleading, in that it required the plaintiff to particularly specify the amount which the plaintiff believes is justly due to him from the defendant. In common-law pleading the only requisite in the statement of the amount of the claim is, that the pleader should make it sufficiently large to cover any possible recovery; but, in the new form of pleading, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to give to the defendant a statement of the particular amount which he believes is justly due: Gould v. Gage, <a href="/pa/118/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="118 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="556759" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0559-01">118 Pa. 559</a>.</p>

    <p id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[243,869,1171,854]]]'>In the first more specific statement, subsequently filed, the plaintiff defines with more particularity the nature of his claim under the first, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of the contract, and states that the amount for which suit is brought is $50,000. In the second supplementary statement, the plaintiff undertook to set forth, in a schedule, some of the particular items of his claim, but claims, in addition thereto, commissions “upon all orders sent direct to the said defendants, and not passing through the hands or coming to the knowledge of the said plaintiff, but upon which the plaintiff is entitled to a commission, under the agreement sued upon.” The plaintiff in his statement then proceeds to say that he “had no connection whatever with the shipments, and cannot now give a detailed list of them; that they are well known to the defendants, and could be easily furnished from their books, if access thereto would be permitted,” etc. To this also the plaintiff appends his affidavit.</p>

By the terms of the agreement Murdock was entitled, in any event, to commissions upon all sales in the cities of Boston, New York, and Brooklyn, Newark, and Jersey City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Chicago; and also in all such places as the purchasers doing business in these cities, respectively, had factories in which lampblack was used, and that, whether the sales were made through the plaintiff’s agency, or directly by the defendants. The plaintiff was also entitled to a commission upon all sales <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>elsewhere, by whomsoever made, excepting as provided in clauses four and five of the contract. Whilst Murdock might be supposed to have an account of his own sales, made pursuant to his agency, he would know nothing of their consummation by delivery; much less could he be presumed to know of the sales which the defendants themselves made. The accounts were therefore necessarily in the keeping of the defendants, and were wholly within their knowledge and control.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[187,765,1163,1623]]]'>Now, it is plain that, as the purpose of the legislature was merely to simplify the practice, it was certainly not the intention to require the plaintiff to embrace in his statement what, in the very nature of the particular case, he could not know, and the knowledge of which was wholly within the power of his adversary. If the agreement in suit had been, by accident, lost and destroyed, and no copy of it remained, would the plaintiff, after substantially stating its contents, be driven out of court upon a demurrer or a nonsuit because the statement was not accompanied by a copy ? Or if, in like case, the agreement in suit had come into the defendant’s hands, would it not be sufficient, after having given its contents substantially, to refer the defendants to the instrument itself, in their own hands, for the exact words and phraseology thereof? We think it would; and, if so, then it was certainly sufficient for the plaintiff, under the special facts of this case, having given a copy of the contract, the nature and extent of his claim under it, and the period of time covered by it, to refer the defendant to the entries upon their own books, for the ascertainment of the exact amount. That was certain, which was thus capable of being made certain. But it was simply impossible, if the statements filed are true, for the plaintiff to set forth the amount which he believed was justly due to him, for he could have no belief on the subject; even an estimate must necessarily have been founded on conjecture, and would have been little better than a guess. Having embraced in his statement all that he could know, he gave the defendants an opportunity, by inspection of their books and papers, to compute the exact amount which, according to the plaintiff’s own showing, was justly due him; and this was all, upon any reasonable application of the requirements of the act of assembly and the rule of court to this particular case, that could be demanded.</p>

      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>That a writ of error lies upon a judgment of nonsuit, thus entered, without the assent of the plaintiff, express or implied, there can be no doubt. The entry of a nonsuit, in such case, is a definitive decree: it ends the suit. The plaintiff may bring another action, but he is undoubtedly entitled to test the decree, which drives him out of court and charges him with the payment of the costs. This is not the case of a peremptory nonsuit, entered at the trial upon the insufficiency of the plaintiff’s proofs, under the act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, where a writ of error, by the express provision of that statute, lies only upon the refusal of the court to take the nonsuit off. The case of Haverly v- Mercur, <a href="/pa/78/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="78 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1040380" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0257-01">78 Pa. 257</a>, has therefore no application.</p>
