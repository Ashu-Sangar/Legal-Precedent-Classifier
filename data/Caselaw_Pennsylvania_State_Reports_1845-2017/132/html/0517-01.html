[The evidence I refer to is, in the first place, a witness testified without objection that before the proceeding we have to do with was instituted, was before ’Squire Fry, this plaintiff made complaint before ’Squire Ease to have the defendant dispossessed, and that Ease decided that case in favor of the defendant. Now gentlemen, that has nothing to do with the question we are now trying, because it is the law that a decision of that sort made, does not prevent the owner of the premises from beginning another proceeding.] 5 And it is not necessary for me to state it, but the record itself of the justice shows reasons in addition to what I have said why that decision is not conclusive. Then the defendant alleged before you that he claimed an interest in the property in question, claimed to be the owner of it, and evidence of that sort was received. The court admitted it; the case of Clark v. Everly, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 226" data-case-ids="483365" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0226-01">8 W. &amp; S. 226</a>, was cited, and without looking further, the court admitted that evidence.

    <p class="summary" id="b544-6" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[240,1489,1174,1010]]]'>In a case of that sort, where a tenant is required to pay his rent or leave the premises, it is not sufficient for him to say simply he claims the premises. The evidence we received here was proof of that kind; that the defendant, Joseph Marsteller, asserted and claimed that he had an interest in the premises and owned them. That is not enough. If the defendant had title or the semblance of title, then the justice would have no jurisdiction for non-payment of rent, and if he had no jurisdiction, the court would have no jurisdiction on appeal. And so, if it appears that the defendant has title, or there is evidence of a claim of title, then the justice cannot proceed, but the party must proceed in some other way. But there is no evidence in this.case from which a title in Joseph Marsteller could be found. Everything that is material of that kind is simply his own assertion that he owned it. There is no evidence that after the death of the mother the other heirs sold it to him, or the executor sold it to him. The will didn’t give it to him, and there is no evidence that the mother in her lifetime gave him the title. So, for all the purposes of this case he has no title, and you must disregard that evidence. ....</p>

If Joseph Marsteller, who was in this house when his mother died, had remained there without a contract of leasing, then a proceeding under the landlord and tenant act for the nonpayment of rent could not be brought, and in order to get him out, if he had any right there, an action of ejectment would have to be brought in court. So, if the plaintiff has not proven there was a leasing, a letting after his mother’s death, then your verdict would be for the defendant. Then he was not in as tenant of the plaintiff.....</p>

Ease, Esq., a justice of the peace, etc., was so proceeded in, that after a full hearing the justice found “ that no demise was made, the relation of landlord and tenant not established,” and on July 3, 1889, gave judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, and thereupon dismissed the complaint, “ with costs to be paid by the plaintiff; ” that within a month after the rendition of the judgment and while it remained, as it still does, in full force, neither reversed nor appealed from, the present proceeding was commenced before another justice of the peace by the same plaintiff, against same defendant, on the same alleged demise. In view of these facts, it was claimed by defendant below that the former judgment, <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>being for the same cause of action and between the same parties, is a bar to this proceeding; and in his second point, reciting the substance of the former proceeding, judgment, etc., he requested the court to charge that the finding of the justice in that proceeding “is conclusive, and the verdict of the jury must be for defendant.” The refusal of the court to so charge constitutes the ninth specification of error. In that part of the charge recited in the fifth specification the learned judge also, in substance, instructed the jury that the former proceedings and judgment did not interfere with the plaintiff’s right to recover in this case. The question, therefore, presented by the fifth and ninth specifications, is as to the effect of the former judgment.</p>

Such a thing would certainly be an anomaly in our system of jurisprudence, the underlying principle of which is that no one shall be twice vexed for the same cause. The well-nigh universal rule is, that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether it be a court of record or not, upon a point litigated between the parties, is conclusive in all subsequent controversies directly involving the same question. The only exception to this rule, that is now recalled, is the action of ejectment on a legal title, in which successive suits may be brought and prosecuted until two concurring verdicts and judgments are obtained.</p>

That judgment, predicated, as it was, of the facts found by the justice, went to the very root of the controversy, and is final and conclusive on both parties until legally set aside or reversed. On general principles, there is no reason why it should not be so. It makes no difference whether that adjudication was in a proceeding according to the course of the common law, or summary in its character. It is quite enough that the <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>question in controversy was submitted to a judicial officer, to be determined in a judicial way; that the parties and their proofs were heard, and their rights settled by a judicial determination.
