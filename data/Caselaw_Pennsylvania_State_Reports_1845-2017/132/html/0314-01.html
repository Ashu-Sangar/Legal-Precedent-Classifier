    <p class="summary" id="A1q" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[245,887,1176,811]]]'>[From the testimony in this case it appears that the defendant had obtained a policy for $2,000 upon his life, which lapsed sometime in 1881; from the time he became insured until the policy was lapsed, there were certain deaths occurred amongst the insured in the company, for which he was assessed. Now, if he was insured and these deaths occurred, and he was assessed and notice given him, he ought to be made to pay. The testimony discloses that he did have such a policy; that there were certain deaths, and that certain assessments were made, and if you believe the testimony of Mr. Alexander, the proper notice of such assessments was mailed to the defendant. And therefore, in the absence of any contradictory testimony upon policy number 1,648, the court feels in duty bound to say to you that the plaintiff has made out such a case as would entitle you and require you to give a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the assessments upon that particular policy.] 1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b340-8" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[245,1705,1173,554]]]'>A question has arisen however upon policy No. 2, or, as it is termed, policy 2,387, for $1,000. It appears that after the first policy had lapsed, Dr. Rossiter made application to have it renewed, and it is claimed by the plaintiff company that instead of renewing or reducing that policy, they issued to him a new one for $1,000. If they did do so, and he accepted or received that policy, then the same proof submitted in this case with reference to the deaths and the assessments and the notice, would govern that case, and if you believe that he was so insured, then your verdict should be in favor of the company for the assessments made upon that policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.3",341,[195,371,1160,499]]]'>
      <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>But Dr. Rossiter has a defence to the second policy; he claims that he never became insured under it, because he would not accept it when handed to him by the agent of the plaintiff company. Before the plaintiff could claim that this contract was consummated with reference to the second policy, it was their duty in some way to show to you that Dr. Rossiter had received this policy, or that it had been sent to him in such a manner as would justify you in believing that he had received it, and then, unless he could show that he had returned it or declined to receive it, he would be liable in the manner that I have stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[195,882,1160,604]]]'>He claims that •when this policy was handed to him by the agent, he rejected it and declined to receive it. Now, up to that time, this agent who had the policy was the representative of the company, and if they chose to send the policy by him they were bound by whatever took place between him and Dr. Rossiter ; and Dr. Rossiter at that time had the right to decline to receive it, and to refuse to go into this company; and therefore if you believe his evidence that he rejected this policy and would not receive it from the agent of the company, I charge you as a matter of law that this company cannot recover upon the second policy, unless in some way they have shown that Dr. Rossiter afterwards recognized it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[197,1493,1158,594]]]'>It is claimed that he did do so because of the payment of a certain assessment, and as evidence of that there has been offered the books of the plaintiff company, in which there is an entry of an assessment having been paid. But that book is not sufficient to show that fact, because it is simply an entry referring to some other book, and the person who received the money is not here to testify to it; nor is there any witness to identify the cash book, nor is the cash book received; and therefore if you believe the testimony of Dr. Rossiter, that he rejected this policy in the manner he stated, there can be no recovery upon that policy, and that, in the opinion of the court, is the only dispute in this case.</p>

But if you believe the statement of Dr. Rossiter that he rejected this policy, your verdict should be in his favor on the second policy; or, in other words, you should then render a verdict in-favor of the plaintiff only for the amount which you find to be due on policy 1,643.</p>
