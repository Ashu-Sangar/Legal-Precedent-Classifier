For the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion of Senior Judge Colins, such omissions in the context of this particular case do not constitute material defects warranting <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>the removal of the signatures. Moreover, the interspersal of the challenged signatures among others dated in 2012 supports a common sense deduction that the challenged signatures also occurred in that year and negates any concern that the omissions “call into question the identity of the signatory or compromise the integrity of the election process.” <em>In re Nomination Petition of Gales, </em><a href="/pa/618/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="618 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="3900204" data-case-paths="/pa/618/0093-01">618 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/pa/618/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="54 A.3d 855" data-case-ids="3900204,7311813" data-case-paths="/pa/618/0093-01,/a3d/54/0855-01">54 A.3d 855</a>, 859 (2012).</p>

Accordingly, we need not address the merits of the additional issue raised on appeal to resolve the matter in a timely fashion.</p>
