Briefly, on September 15, 1993, Appellant’s co-defendant Bradley Martin received a prison visitation pass that allowed him to leave the Lebanon County prison where he was incar<a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>cerated. He met Appellant, with whom he was romantically involved, and failed to return to prison as required. Instead, the two traveled to Palmyra, Lebanon County, where they called upon Guy Goodman, with whom Martin was acquainted. Goodman, who was seventy-four years old, had visited Martin in prison, identifying himself as Martin’s friend.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[271,637,1149,520]]]'>After arriving at Goodman’s home, Martin struck Goodman over the head with a vase, and the pair disabled Goodman by tightly binding his wrists, ankles, and neck. They then placed various wrappings around his head, sealing them with duct tape. Finally, they carried Goodman into the basement, tying him even more securely and wrapping him in a bedspread, and then leaving him to suffocate while they stole his checkbook and credit card and fled in his car. During their flight, Appellant and Martin used Goodman’s credit card and checks to pay their expenses.</p>

Martin declined to testify at trial, but Appellant testified in her own behalf, and her tape-recorded confession was played for the jury. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jury found both defendants guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated assault, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, flight to avoid apprehension, escape, and conspiracy. During the penalty phase, the Commonwealth presented two aggravating factors with respect to <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>Appellant, namely, that the killing was perpetrated during the commission of a felony, and that it was committed by means of torture. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), (8). In her mitigation case, Appellant presented evidence concerning her age at the time of the crime, her relatively minor role in the homicide, and the “catch-all” mitigating factor relating to her character and record and the circumstances of the offense. <em>See <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">id.</a> </em>§§ 9711(e)(4), (7), (8). At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury returned a death sentence for each defendant, having found all aggravating circumstances presented and no mitigating factors for either defendant.

The Supreme Court has characterized these situations as subsuming an “active representation” of conflicting interests, <em>see, e.g., Mickens, </em><a href="/us/535/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="535 U.S. 162" data-case-ids="353765" data-case-paths="/us/535/0162-01">535 U.S. at 166</a>, 122 S.Ct. at 1241 (reciting that the Court has foregone inquiry into actual prejudice where “the defendant’s attorney actively represented conflicting interests”), which it has recognized as being inherently suspect. <em>See id. </em>at 168, 122 S.Ct. at 1241 (quoting <em>Holloway, </em><a href="/us/435/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="435 U.S. 475" data-case-ids="2258" data-case-paths="/us/435/0475-01">435 U.S. at 489-90</a>, <a href="/us/435/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="435 U.S. 475" data-case-ids="2258" data-case-paths="/us/435/0475-01">98 S.Ct. at 1181</a>). In this respect, <em>i.e., </em>in focusing on the “active” nature of the conflict, the Court’s concern centers primarily on the potential for an attorney to alter his trial strategy due to extrinsic considerations stemming from other loyalties, thereby distorting counsel’s strategic or tactical decisions in a manner that would not occur if counsel’s sole loyalty were to the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Wood v.

Here again, however, during Appellant’s direct appeal this Court found that such proofs were introduced at trial for a legitimate purpose, namely, to establish that there was a relationship between Martin and Goodman prior to the murder, and that an appropriate cautionary instruction was given. <em>See King, </em><a href="/pa/554/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="554 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="765961" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0331-01">554 Pa. at 349-50</a>, <a href="/a2d/721/0763-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="721 A.2d 763" data-case-ids="11794952,11795060,765961,765969" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/0763-01,/a2d/721/0763-02,/pa/554/0331-01,/pa/554/0330-01">721 A.2d at 772</a>.

She states that testimony regarding such personal qualities may only be admitted if relevant to an issue at trial. In particular, Appellant contends that counsel erred in failing to object to Goodman’s “testimony from beyond the grave, read into the record by Detective Radwanski,” as well as “victim impact testimony provided by [GoodmanJ’s daughter ... and <em>Lebanon Daily News </em>photographer James Zengerle.” Brief for Appellant at 45. Appellant appears to be referring to certain evidence that was brought to this Court’s attention on direct appeal. Concerning such proofs, this Court expressed that</p>
    <blockquote id="An" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[209,1012,1111,461]]]'>all of the challenged evidence was relevant to issues that were before the jury. Given that there were no signs of forced entry into Mr. Goodman’s home, the inference arose that the murder had been committed by someone who was acquainted with him and either had his own key or had been voluntarily admitted. Thus, the letter [written by Goodman and read by Detective Radwanski] was properly admitted to establish that Martin had a prior relationship with Goodman.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[209,1499,1108,687]]]'>The testimony of the daughter was probative of the fact that Goodman resided alone. Finally, the photographs and accompanying testimony of the photographer were relevant because the pictures depicted the vase that Martin used to strike Goodman, as well as a hutch from which, according to the testimony of Goodman’s daughter, the defendants could have obtained the duct tape that they used to bind Goodman. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the potential prejudice about which Appellants complain, namely the effect of sympathetic glimpses of Goodman’s character and life which the jury could have gleaned from the evidence, was outweighed by the probative value of these proofs.</blockquote>

In his claim, Martin had challenged the exclusion from the venire of individuals over 65, housewives, and persons making less than $5,000 per year, as those individuals are exempt from paying per capita taxes. This Court concluded that Martin had failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that he was denied a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community. We observed as a general matter that Martin was required, first, to demonstrate the arguable merit of the underlying <em>claim </em>— ie., that the method of jury selection was improper as violating the Constitution’s fair-cross-section requirement. To do so, he would have to show that: (1) the group allegedly excluded is a distinctive group in the community; (2) representation of this group in the pool from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) the under-representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. <em>See Duren v.

Appellant cites no controlling case from this Court or from the U.S. Supreme Court — for there are none — that holds, or even suggests, that a cognizable Sixth Amendment conflict of interest, establishing an entitlement to <em>Cronic/Sullivan </em>relief, can arise solely from the level of remuneration provided to court-appointed counsel.</p>

In the course of its analysis, the Majority notes that it “credits” appellant’s argument “to the degree it proposes that it is possible for an underpaid attorney’s financial interest in undertaking other, more remunerative work, to impinge on his or her full devotion to the interests of the client at issue — at least in the sense that the attorney may be incentivized to spend less time and fewer resources representing the client as a result of such extrinsic financial pressures.” The Majority then provides an extensive discussion of appellant’s novel conflict theory in the context of governing law from the High Court, ultimately holding that the theory must fail because, <em>inter alia, </em>the Court has made clear that alleged conflicts arising from counsel’s “personal or financial interests” cannot form the basis for a claim under <em>Sullivan.

    <blockquote id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[317,1933,1111,422]],["BL_521.1",521,[211,311,1108,632]]]'>[A]ny question of whether appellant’s trial counsel was actually conflicted must be measured by the governing law as it existed when this matter was tried. As members of the bar, lawyers are obligated to recognize and avoid actual conflicts in the first instance, just as they are obligated not to pursue baseless or frivolous claims.... Appellant’s current counsel is essentially claiming that trial counsel was obliged, at the time of trial, to inform the court that he had <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>a conflict because of the pending disciplinary investigation and to seek to withdraw from representation of appellant. But nothing in the law, either at the time of appellant’s trial or now, remotely suggests that counsel was bound to view his own unrelated personal disciplinary issues, which were evidently public knowledge in the Lehigh County legal community, as creating an actual conflict -with his client. In short, appellant proposes a novel and unprincipled expansion of what amounts to “actual conflict.” Even if a court someday were to adopt such an odd rule, however, that new rule could not be used to retroactively condemn trial counsel’s conduct decades ago.</blockquote>

Majority Op. at 428, 57 A.3d at 621. I agree. I would merely add that, given that questions alleging a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel require us to view counsel’s conduct under standards in existence when counsel acted, I view it as unlikely that the High Court would embrace this sort of novel theory of actual conflict upon collateral review, and then fault trial counsel under the new conflict rule. On the separate question of whether to credit aspects of appellant’s underlying theory, given my reservations above concerning the cognizability of the claim on a collateral attack, I view the query as unnecessary to decide. Moreover, as the Majority makes clear, “there is little evidence of record to suggest that the fee cap resulted in an actual conflict,” and, indeed, trial counsel denied the accusation. Majority Op. at 427, n. 13, 57 A.3d at 620, n. 13. The absence of any such evidence perhaps explains why appellant poses her argument in absolutist terms declaring, as <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>if the point could not even be disputed, that “the fee-cap created a conflict of interest” and that the cap “inevitably” affected counsel’s performance in an adverse way.</p>

More prosaically, as this Court sees on its Miscellaneous docket, attorney lapses from such circumstances can extend to simple matters such as filing deadlines. But, as the Majority explains, the High Court’s decisional law in the <em>Sullivan </em>/Sixth Amendment conflict of interest area has focused narrowly on dual representation of clients with diverging interests, a circumstance the Court has deemed “inherently suspect.” Until the Court provides otherwise, I view conflict claims arising from counsel’s personal circumstances differently, and as sounding under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="235" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. 668</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="236" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="237" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">80 L.Ed.2d 674</a> (1984), which requires a claim-specific showing of deficient performance and actual prejudice, rather than the application of the <em>per se </em>rule appellant asks us to innovate and retroactively enforce, premised upon a fee-cap and her broad assumptions and assertions about the “inevitable” effect of such a cap.</p>

But, whether a capped fee from decades ago is inadequate or not is a subjective matter, requiring consideration of the time, the place, the professional expectations and devotion of the attorney involved, and even the attorney’s personal financial situation. In this case, it may be possible to compare the fee to counsel’s ordinary fee in other matters, but we have no basis to comment upon its objective adequacy or inadequacy for the time or the place or the task. I suspect that in many counties in <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>Pennsylvania in 1994, assistant district attorneys and public defenders earned comparably modest hourly wages.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[161,431,1152,1134]]]'>But, that difficulty is less important than the difficulty that the theory seeks recognition of a controlling assumption of actual conflict and incompetence. <em>Pro bono </em>counsel often work for no fee; are they therefore to be presumed incompetent on suspicion or insinuation that, in pursuit of remuneration from paying clients, they must invariably have sabotaged their <em>pro bono </em>clients’ causes? Appellant’s absolutist theory— and that is all it is — reflects a cynical and unsupportable view of the legal profession. I do not doubt that the vast majority of attorneys, regardless of financial status, consider themselves duty-bound to live up to their professional obligation when called upon for court appointment. Many lawyers consciously choose careers, in public service or elsewhere, offering relatively modest compensation, because they are drawn to the importance of the cause. This is just as applicable to the criminal defense bar. The fact that it happens is a credit to the profession as a whole. In this case, appellant’s conflict of interest “theory” entails a rank speculative assumption that the fact of the fee cap, alone, created a conflict of interest because “for each hour [counsel] worked on the case, she lost money.” Appellant’s Brief at 19. Quite simply, this is a farfetched leap of logic.</p>

The fact that most appointed counsel meet the challenge does not mean that compensation levels are, or have been, appropriate or reasonable. Nor does it mean that there have not been cases where attorney compensation and support for defense investigative services have compromised counsel’s ability to mount a constitutionally adequate defense. The issue of compensation is a systemic one impheating the executive branch, which is obliged to fund indigent defense services, the courts, and the criminal defense bar. As criminal defense funding is left to individual counties in Pennsylvania, and the circumstances in <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>individual counties vary considerably, there is no easy solution to the problem; but nobody with experience in these matters would dispute that the problem exists. For purposes of the collateral review decision here, however, and for the reasons I have stated, I simply do not believe that the Sixth Amendment, as construed by the High Court, embraces the absolutist conflict theory forwarded here.</p>

Indeed, the only substantive legal difference which I see between the expressions of the majority and the Chief Justice pertains to the hypothetical circumstance in which a defendant might prove through credited evidence (say, direct testimony from his attorney) that counsel prioritized his own financial interests above the interests of his client and, as a result, rendered deficient stewardship prejudicing the defense. The majority opinion refuses to rule out that a conflict claim might be stated in such a scenario, whereas, the concurrence seems largely to represent the Chief Justice’s reaction to such reservation.</p>

I would submit that, in fact, we have seen more than enough instances of deficient stewardship to raise very serious questions concerning the presumption’s accuracy. It is my considered position, like that of <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>many others, that a contributing factor may be the pervasive underfunding of indigent defense. <em>See, e.g., supra </em>note 5 (citing Report of the National Right to Counsel Committee, Justice Denied: America’s Continuing Neglect of Our Constitutional Right to Counsel (Apr.2009)).

It certainly remains arguable that ineptitude of this sort and magnitude should not redound to the detriment of an indigent petitioner pursuing what is likely to be his single opportunity to secure state post-conviction appellate review of his sentence of death.</blockquote>

If fee caps may create a “conflict of interest,” then, <em>a fortiori, pro bono </em>representation creates a conflict — if too little payment can do so, no payment at all would almost certainly do so. Of course, the truth is that countless attorneys handle countless legal matters for people with little or no compensation. This does not mean evidence “that counsel prioritized his own financial interests above the interests of his client and, as a result, rendered deficient stewardship prejudicing the defense” would not allow for a claim of ineffectiveness. Concurring Op., at 448, 57 A.3d at 633-34 (Saylor, J., concurring). Such would be an admission of ineffectiveness, contrary to “prevailing professional norms,” and counsel’s reasoning for his ineffectiveness would be inconsequential to the determination. <em>See id. </em>at 421-23, 57 A.3d at 617-18 (citing <em>Bobby v. Van Hook, </em><a href="/us/558/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="317" data-cite="558 U.S. 4" data-case-ids="3638939" data-case-paths="/us/558/0004-01">558 U.S. 4</a>, <a href="/us/558/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="318" data-cite="558 U.S. 4" data-case-ids="3638939" data-case-paths="/us/558/0004-01">130 S.Ct. 13</a>, <a href="/us/558/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="319" data-cite="558 U.S. 4" data-case-ids="3638939" data-case-paths="/us/558/0004-01">175 L.Ed.2d 255</a> (2009)). However, it would not be based on a conflict of interest. The love of money may be the root of all evil and some ineffectiveness, but by itself, it does not create a legal conflict of interest.</p>
