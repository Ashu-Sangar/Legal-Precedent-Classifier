Appellants argued that, because the ordinance imposes a flat tax for businesses earning over $1,000,000, while exempting businesses with gross receipts below that amount, it constitutes a tax “on gross receipts or part thereof,” namely, the part of gross receipts over $1,000,000.</p>

Appellants maintain that the situation here is different because the present Ordinance only imposes a tax on a business when its annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000. Therefore, Appellants reason, the tax depends on, and is calculated with respect to, a business’s gross receipts, making it a tax “on gross receipts <em>or part thereof” </em>— in particular, that part of gross receipts that exceeds the $1,000,000 threshold. Appellants claim that, in reaching a contrary conclusion, the Commonwealth Court failed to recognize the difference between a tax that is imposed on all businesses in a municipality and one that is imposed on only those meeting a certain annual threshold of gross receipts. They also assert that the common pleas court erred by limiting the scope of the Section 533(a) proscription to taxes calculated as a percentage of gross receipts.</p>

During its meetings, Appellants contend, the Board did not consider a flat tax on all business, but instead debated the amount of the tax that would have to be imposed at each exemption level in order to generate the funds required to alleviate the $400,000 budget shortfall. As such, Appellants argue that the tax imposed under the Ordinance ultimately depends (and was designed to depend) on the gross receipts of each business in the township.</p>

Since the flat levy of $2,600 per non-exempt business is set by ordinance and not calculated based on the taxpayer’s actual gross receipts, Appellees reason it is not a tax “on gross receipts or part thereof’ for Section 533(a) purposes.</p>

Here, it is not the amount of the tax that is measured based on the taxpayer’s gross receipts. Rather, the applicability of the tax to a particular category of taxpayers is defined by the amount of the taxpayer’s gross receipts in a given tax year.

The Board would apparently have preferred a sliding-scale tax, but as that option was foreclosed by law, it enacted a business privilege tax that it viewed as the best substitute: a substantial flat tax with a high exemption threshold designed to tax large businesses while shielding small ones from liability. We conclude that, when construed according to its common and approved usage, the prohibition on levying a business privilege tax “on gross receipts or part thereof’ was intended to cover this type of tax.
