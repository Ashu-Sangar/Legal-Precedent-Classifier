For any public utility that fails to file a timely actual revenue statement, the Commission is required to estimate the revenue, and the estimated gross operating revenue (“estimated revenue(s)”) is used to calculate that utility’s assessment, along with the allocation of the total assessment among all public utilities operating in the Commonwealth.</p>

In 2005, Mercury failed to file by March 31 the statement of its actual revenue for 2004. On April 29, 2005, the Commission notified Mercury of its omission. Subsequently, the Commission estimated Mercury’s revenue for 2004 at $8,492,767, equal to Mercury’s actual revenue for 2003 of $7,582,828 plus twelve percent, and calculated Mercury’s 2005 annual operations fee based on this estimated revenue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On August 17, 2005, the Commission issued Mercury a Notice of Assessment and General Assessment Invoice for $32,210.

Mercury argued that it was entitled to a recalculation of its 2005 annual assessment, <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>which it claimed should have been $19,967.02, and requested a partial refund of $12,242.98. The Commission responded that the 2004 revenue estimate was binding upon Mercury pursuant to Section 510(b) of the Code and, as a result, the 2005 operations fee was correctly assessed. The parties presented their arguments to an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) for rulings on Mercury’s objections and on the Commission’s motion to dismiss the objections. The ALJ denied the Commission’s motion and, ultimately, determined that the Commission’s revenue estimate was excessive and a partial refund of Mercury’s assessment payment was appropriate. On May 22, 2006, a five-member adjudicatory panel of the Commission reversed the decision of the ALJ and denied Mercury’s request for a refund. Mercury filed a petition for review of the Commission’s decision in the Commonwealth Court’s appellate jurisdiction.</p>

To the extent this first part of the argument implicates estoppel, Mercury forwards no claim that it relied on the Commission’s position in <em>UPS I, </em>detrimentally or otherwise, in filing its challenge in the Commonwealth Court. In fact, Mercury pursued an administrative agency appeal initially and not an action at law for a refund.

The Commission explains that the statutory scheme governing assessments is designed around actual revenues reported timely by utilities or, when such reports are not filed or are filed untimely, around binding estimations of revenues. The deadline for reporting revenue serves an important purpose. Each utility’s assessment represents a portion of the Commission’s annual costs dependent on a comparison of its revenue to revenues of other Commission-regulated utilities. “[T]he Commission must first have fixed revenue figures to begin the calculation” and, “[i]f a party were permitted to alter its revenue figure[, whether actual or estimated,] after the calculation is completed, the party would effectively be altering the assessment rate for all utilities.” Commission’s Brief at 25 (citing 66 Pa.C.S. § 510(b)).</p>

If a utility fails in that obligation, either by failing to file at all or failing to file in timely fashion, the provision requires that the Commission estimate its revenue. The Commission is then to use the estimated revenue to calculate the assessment of the utility. The calculation is a ministerial task which results in a set of individual assessment rates applied to Commission-regulated utilities.

Conversely, Mercury alleges that its challenge (citing statutory grounds that the rate applied is excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid) was to the “non-binding” assessment, and not to the “binding” estimate. Mercury’s position rests on two assumptions regarding the statutory scheme: (1) that, as pled, its claim is not a challenge to the “binding” revenue estimate; and (2) that while an estimated revenue is binding for the purposes of calculating the initial assessment, the adjudication of objections raised on statutory grounds under Sections 510(c) or 510(d) is divorced from an inquiry into whether the initial assessment was valid under Section 510(b). For the following reasons, we hold that the Commission’s construction adheres more closely to the plain language of the statute.</p>

In theory, there are multiple types of challenges that could sound under the statutory terms “excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid”; for example, a party could challenge the simple mathematical computation of the operations fee, or the factors used to calculate the estimated revenue, such as the assignment of a twelve percent increase over the prior year’s revenue made by the Commission here. Pleading <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>aside, Mercury’s claim is predicated on offering Mercury’s actual revenue data as evidence that the estimated revenue figure, which the Commission was required to employ once Mercury failed in its obligation to provide its actual revenue, was erroneous or excessive.

On the other hand, of course, a utility that ignores or misses the March 31 deadline may benefit from an underestimation of its revenue, with the result that the utility’s assessment will be lower than if its actual revenue was used in the calculation. The estimate is deemed “binding” for the purposes of calculating the assessment rates as provided by Section 510(b)(1) through (4), so that the Commission may go about its task of fairly allocating its costs among all utilities. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 510(b).</p>

A plain reading of the statute, however, indicates otherwise. Section 510(b)’s provision that an estimated revenue is “binding” is made without any qualification that the binding effect dissipates upon a utility’s objection. Essentially, Mercury would have us read Section 510(b) as stating that the estimate is meaninglessly binding, <em>i.e., </em>binding to assist the Commission in determining the proper proportionate assessments for all utilities, but with that determination subject to disruption any time an individual utility objects to this binding effect with a belated accounting of its actual revenues. By the same token, since the statute authorizes the Commission to estimate the revenue of a non-compliant utility, the fact of that estimation simply cannot establish an assessment rate that is “excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid.” Rather, it is a rate premised upon an approved statutory formula. Mercury’s interpretation is not supported by the plain language of the provision and would essentially read the term “binding” out of Section 510(b).</p>

We cannot agree, for instance, that the General Assembly devised the statute as an exercise for the Commission in administrative paper-shuffling and futility: require the Commission to calculate initial proportionate assessments utility-wide based on required estimates using a mandatory formula, while <em>per se </em>invalidating any compliant initial assessment and automatically requiring the Commission to undertake calculations anew based on different data once a non-compliant utility objects. Indeed, we view this construction of Section 510(b) as contrary to that part of the provision which places the burden of proof in an assessment challenge on the public utility. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 510(f) (“Intent of section”). Mercury’s construction, furthermore, removes any incentive for a utility to file a timely statement of its actual revenue. Under Mercury’s interpretation, a public utility <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>may ignore the revenue filing deadline without consequence because the utility may wait upon its assessment, keep silent if the Commission underestimates its actual revenue, but object in instances of overestimation by offering a belated, actual revenue statement as unrebuttable proof that the estimated revenue was “excessive.” Indeed, the public utility would have an incentive to “roll the dice” on the Commission’s estimate because, under Mercury’s interpretation, a non-compliant utility, unlike a compliant utility, would be able to invalidate an undesirable assessment. Mercury’s view of the statutory scheme veers too far from the General Assembly’s intent that each public utility should assume its reasonable share of the Commission’s administrative costs in a timely manner, and is therefore unsustainable.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[140,1068,1152,256]]]'>Mercury also posits that the right to object (and prove that an assessment is “excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid”) is illusory unless an objection to estimated revenue in instances of non-compliant utilities can dissipate the binding effect of the revenue estimate.

For example, in any computational regime mathematical errors may exist. A utility may complain that the statutory formula was incorrectly employed to arrive at the assessment rate, that the Commission violated the utility’s due process rights by, <em>e.g., </em>using an arbitrary or capricious formula to estimate revenue; or assert other challenges of this nature. In this sense, although fixed by law, any initial assessment theoretically is subject to challenge. A challenge, however, has to be appropriate and timely. A claim that the Commission failed to use late-filed actual revenue figures is not an appropriate ground for objection, in the face of statutory language that commands the Commission to estimate revenue when a utility fails in its duty to provide a timely statement of its actual revenue, and states that the estimate is “binding.”</p>

In addition to implementing new mandates of the Constitution, the 1978 process of repeal and partial reenactment of the several acts was also part of the General Assembly’s advance in the 1970s toward a general code, known as the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes.

In <em>Maritime Management, </em>this Court reversed the Commonwealth Court’s quashal of the appeal of a liquor licensee from a decision of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. The Court held that Section 701 of the AAL created a right of appeal, regardless of the prohibition against appeal in Section 408(b) of the Liquor Code. <a href="/pa/531/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="531 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1834408" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0095-01">611 A.2d at </a>205 (citing 47 P.S. § 4-408(b)). Notwithstanding the broad language quoted in the text, we do not overstate the applicability of the decision, however. We recognize that the language of Section 408 of the Liquor Code differs significantly from that of Section 510(d)-(e) of the Public Utility Code. Specifically, Section 510(e) states that an action at law for a refund, pursuant to Section 510(d), is the exclusive means by which an assessment decision may be challenged in court, while Section 408 of the Liquor Code neither offers an alternate review process nor addresses exclusivity. The <em>Maritime Management </em>Court held that no conflict existed between the Liquor Code and the AAL provisions. <em><a href="/pa/531/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="531 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1834408" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0095-01">Id.</a></em>

Section 510(b) provides for a four-step calculation in which the Commission: (1) determines and assigns expenditures dedicated to the group of utilities to which the specific public utility belongs; (2) determines the balance of total expenditures, after dedicated expenditures are assigned, and assigns portions of the balance among groups of utilities in accordance with the proportion of their revenue to the total revenue sum for all utilities; (3) allocates a share of the total assessment to each utility group, in proportion to the expenditures assigned to the group; and (4) allocates a share of the assessment of the group to each utility, in proportion to the revenue of the utility to the total revenue sum of the public utilities in its group. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>§ 510(b)(l)-(4).

Mercury correctly points out that the effect of a fluctuating assessment rate system, by itself, does not entitle the Commission to relief. The General Assembly permits the filing of objections, which could have the same destabilizing result if sustained. Objections, and the opportunities to be heard and present evidence, are properly available and reflect the General Assembly's recognition that property rights are affected in deriving assessments. <em>Cf. Rogers, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="724 A.2d 319" data-case-ids="11635899,1702003" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0319-01,/pa/555/0285-01">724 A.2d at 321-22</a>; <em>accord Kowenhoven, </em><a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="901 A.2d 1003" data-case-ids="3466842,8419141" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01,/a2d/901/1003-01">901 A.2d at 1009-10</a> (agencies must comply with due process). But, the General Assembly retains the power to prescribe the grounds on which objections are (available, as a matter of policy). In this case, the legislative scheme reflects a trade-off between the ability of each public utility to challenge an individual binding estimate of its revenue at will and the finality and predictability of assessments gained by utilities as a group.</p>

In my view, Section 510(d) serves a meaningful role in reducing the potential for appearances of impropriety through the maintenance of a unique process of judicial oversight triggered by a direct action at law, with an extended time period allowed for continuing investigation and scrutiny. The prescribed process contrasts substantially with the deferential review of general agency adjudications under the Administrative Agency Law and associated Rules of Appellate Procedure, which must be invoked within a more compressed timeframe. Section 510’s self-contained refund process also is plainly structured as a quid pro quo for the requirement that utilities must pay contested assessments in the first instance without delay or restraint. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 510(d) (“Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, on the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid____”).</p>
