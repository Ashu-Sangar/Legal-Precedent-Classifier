For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Superior Court that, in order to avoid liability, a defendant raising a claim of highly reckless conduct must indeed plead and prove such claim as an affirmative defense. Moreover, this evidence must further establish that the highly reckless conduct was the sole or superseding cause of the injuries sustained. We therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Douglas gave the tree stands to Appellee, who in turn paid Douglas for them. For approximately the next two years, Appellee used one of the tree stands on multiple occasions, while leaving the second sealed in the box. On September 25, 2005, Appellee took the second, previously unused tree stand to his other <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>brother Daniel’s house, intending to install the second stand in a tree in the vicinity.</p>
    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[141,432,1153,1120]]]'>Appellee and his brother Daniel assembled the tree stand at Daniel’s house, selected a suitable tree, and Appellee utilized a “ladder stick” to climb twenty to twenty-five feet to install the stand in the tree. Upon placing the stand in the tree, Appellee cinched the locking strap around the tree’s trunk to secure the stand. Appellee then climbed onto the platform of the tree stand and, while bear hugging the tree, raised himself on his toes and came down on the platform. According to Appellee, this self-taught maneuver, known as “setting the stand,” is used to secure the stand firmly in the tree by taking any slack out of the locking strap. Appellee had performed this maneuver, in his estimation, hundreds of times on other stands before September 25, 2005. This time, however, when Appellee came down onto the stand’s platform, the locking strap broke, and Appellee fell to the ground. Daniel assisted his brother back to his residence. He subsequently sought medical attention, which revealed that the fall had resulted in a crushed vertebra and fractured wrist. When Appellee and his brother Daniel examined the tree stand, they discovered that the locking strap had been only glued, rather than like a seatbelt, which is glued and stitched.</p>

        <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>First, the Dissent asserts that the statement in Chief Justice Jones' opinion — that evidence of "abnormal use” is not properly submitted as an affirmative defense — is currently positive law in the Commonwealth because the former Chief Justice's opinion was later "cited with approval” by a unanimous court in <em>Azzarello </em>and subsequent Section 402A cases. <em>Azzarello </em>concerned only whether the phrase “unreasonably dangerous,” as contained in Section 402A, could properly be used in jury instructions in Pennsylvania products liability cases. While the <em>Azzarello </em>Court may have "cited with approval” Chief Justice Jones' <em>Berkebile </em>opinion in this regard, it certainly did not consider, let alone adopt, any statement by Chief Justice Jones that "abnormal use” cannot be submitted as an affirmative defense.</p>
      <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.2",323,[174,1014,1118,303]]]'>Second, while we recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has theorized that Chief Justice Jones’ opinion on the utilization of “abnormal use” evidence has been adopted by this Court through <em>Azzarello, </em>again, a careful reading of <em>Azzarello </em>reveals nothing of the sort. Notably, since the federal court of appeals’ decision in <em>Lewis, </em>the Superior Court has consistently treated product misuse and highly reckless conduct as affirmative defenses, as demonstrated by the cases discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="b323-7" data-blocks='[["BL_323.3",323,[172,1320,1120,305]]]'>Third, the precedent string-cited by the Dissent in furtherance of its claim that <em>Berkebile </em>controls this case only reflects that this Court has "cited with approval” <em>Berkebile </em>for two reasons: (1) the general elements a plaintiff must prove in a Section 402A case; and (2) the often-stated maxim that no theories of negligence are permitted in Pennsylvania Section 402A cases. Neither of these precepts are questions in this case, nor do the cited cases concern themselves with abnormal use, product misuse, or highly reckless conduct.</p>
      <p id="b323-8" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[170,1629,1119,730]]]'>Finally, we must comment that the Dissent’s citation to and employment of the lead opinion in <em>Berkebile </em>does not support the Dissent's ultimate conclusion that highly reckless conduct may be asserted as an affirmative defense in some instances, but not in others. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra, </em>pp. 247-49, 55 A.3d pp. 1100-01; <em>see also </em>Dissenting Op. at 259-60, 55 A.3d at 1107-08 (commenting that highly reckless conduct may not be asserted as an affirmative defense if the defendant contends that such conduct was the "sole cause” of sustained injuries). As Appellants herein have argued, accepting Chief Justice Jones' opinion on its face would preclude abnormal use/product misuse/highly reckless conduct from being asserted as an affirmative defense in a Section 402A case in any circumstance. Our examination of the principles of affirmative defenses and strict products liability, <em>supra, </em>has belied this conclusion, and, even the Dissent, in part, contradicts itself in this regard. <em>See </em>Dissenting Op. at 259-60, 55 A.3d at 1107-08 (agreeing that highly reckless conduct may be asserted as an affirmative defense if the defendant alleges that such conduct was a "superseding cause” of the sustained injuries). Thus, the citation to <em>Berkebile </em>simply does not support the positions taken by the Dissent.</p>

We further note that leading scholars in the area fail to recognize any substantive difference between sole and superseding causes in plaintiff misconduct cases. In practical application, a plaintiff's conduct that could be found to preclude recovery altogether "may sometimes count as a superseding cause, or, as courts often say, the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff’s own harm.” Dan B. Dobbs, The Law Of Torts § 196 (West 2000). Dobbs notes that the interchangeability of the phrases sole and superseding causes are steeped in "defense rhetoric and may cloud the court’s holding with ambiguity.” <em>Id. </em>§ 196 n.2. Thus, while the Dissent posits that our "holding runs the real risk of the issuance of confusing jury instructions on causation and on the respective burdens of proof that are placed on parties in products liability cases,” Dissenting Op. at 259, 55 A.3d at 1107, should the Dissent’s suggestions be accepted, it would be left to the bench and bar at the trial level to untangle in each case whether sole or superseding cause was being asserted; at best an elusive task given the substantial overlap of these concepts in the "real world.” Indeed, in practical application, this Court’s committee for standard jury instructions recently recognized that Pennsylvania jurisprudence is most faithfully adhered to when trial courts instruct juries solely regarding "factual cause,” so as to remove any confusion juries may have in assigning causation, while concomitantly not altering the trial structure. <em>See </em>Pa.SSJI (Civ) § 13.160 (subcommittee note); <em>see also Rodgers v. Yellow Cab Co., </em><a href="/pa/395/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="395 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1282786" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0412-01">395 Pa. 412</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20611" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="147 A.2d 611">147 A.2d 611</a>, 617 (1959) (opining that the distinction between factual cause, legal cause, and proximate cause “means nothing to the ordinary jury”).</p>
      <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[172,2080,1121,270]]]'>Moreover, if the Dissent's position concerning sole cause versus superseding cause would be accepted, we can foresee no astute defense counsel ever pleading superseding cause, and thereby imposing upon himself a burden of proof. Rather, defendants would continuously employ evidence of what the Dissent sees as sole cause to attack a plaintiff’s attempt to prove his case without any attendant burden of proof. Indeed, that is what occurred here.</p>

At the same time, however, Chief Justice Jones explained that the evidence was relevant to rebut the plaintiffs proof on causation because it tended to show that, even if the helicopter was defective, decedent took longer to attempt autorotation than even a non-defective helicopter would have allowed him. <a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">462 Pa. at 99</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">337 A.2d at 901</a>.

The majority dismisses <em>Berkebile </em>as a plurality opinion and, further, is critical of the guidance I derive from the lead opinion authored by Chief Justice Jones in that case. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 244-48 &amp; n. 12, 55 A.3d at 1098-1100 &amp; n. 12. Since its issuance, in 1975, Chief Justice Jones’ opinion in <em>Berkebile </em>has been cited with approval by our Court in any number of majority opinions as to the foundational principles that govern Section 402A actions. I, therefore, presently consider <em>Berkebile </em>to be an authoritative statement of Pennsylvania law. <em>See, e.g., Beard v.

As I explain, <em>see supra </em>n. 5, the issue of product misuse forms no part of my analysis in the present appeal as to what role evidence of the plaintiff’s highly reckless conduct as the sole cause of his injuries must play in the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>litigation of a Section 402A action on the element of causation in the plaintiff's case.</p>

Unlike the majority, I am confident that a defense attorney in any particular Section 402A case will pursue, on his client’s behalf, the highly reckless conduct defense that is borne out by the facts and bear the burden of proof the law imposes. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 249 n. 13, 55 A.3d at 1100 n. 13. (”[I]f the Dissent’s position concerning sole cause versus superseding cause would be accepted, we can foresee no astute defense counsel ever pleading superseding cause, and thereby imposing upon himself a burden of proof.”).</p>
