(“PHS”), advancing a single cause of action expressly grounded on negligence theory. According to the complaint, in January 2005 PHS was providing medical services at the State Correctional Institution at Muncy pursuant to a contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (“DOC”). At that time, Appellee worked as a corrections officer at the prison and was assigned to strip search its female inmates before and after they received visitors. Upon information and belief, the complaint asserted, approximately twelve such inmates were infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”), a contagious bacterial infection. Appellee also alleged that the skin condition of these inmates was “characterized by PHS as ‘spider bites.’ ” Com<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>plaint ¶ 7.

According to the complaint, PHS’s staff breached this asserted duty by failing to: perform bacterial cultures on inmates with suspicious skin lesions suggestive of MRSA; ensure that inmates with MRSA were removed from the general prison population to prevent the spread of the disease; advise the prison staff on how to avoid acquiring MRSA from an infected inmate; and advise Appellee of precautions that she should take in strip searching inmates infected with MRSA. <em>See id. </em>¶25. The complaint asserted that, since PHS’s staff members were acting within the course and scope of their employment, liability should be imputed to PHS. Appellee requested compensation for pain and suffering, medical costs (which she noted may be subject to subrogation), and unspecified other financial losses occasioned by her injuries. <em>See id. </em>¶ 27.</p>

Further, PHS and its <em>amici </em>have identified broader salient policy considerations, including potentially expansive exposure to liabilities if the Court is to transform the <em>DiMarco </em>duty to advise patients into a requirement to undertake affirmative third-party interventions, depending on a circumstance-by-circumstance assessment of foreseeability of risk; and instability in the medical liability insurance arena associated with the breadth of the existing liability exposure of physicians, which the Legislature has sought to address in many ways, not the least via the creation and maintenance of a government-run administrative scheme of supplemental insurance and regulation. <em>See, e.g., </em>40 P.S. §§ 1303.101-1303.1115.</p>

In terms of such negligence claims — because the prison environment is so highly regulated, given the pervasive concerns for protocol and security, and in light of the range of other unknown social effects — Appellee’s two-pronged argument for imposing new, loose, affirmative duties on physicians is not strong enough to overcome the default position in favor of the status quo.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_28" id="ref_footnote_1_28">28</a>

In the absence of policy arguments or a request for an opportunity to develop a record, the court did not err in applying the default approach of declining to impose upon professional undertakings new affirmative common-law duties running to third-parties to the professional relationship.

On the subject of legal duties, there is a debate among scholars concerning the appropriate role of substantive relationality <em>(i.e. </em>the presence or absence of some form of prior relationship or dealings between the parties). <em>See </em>W.

L.Rev. 671</a>, 715-16 (2008). Some scholars believe such relationality should not be considered in duty determinations where a defendant’s conduct created the risk of harm. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=81%20S.%20Cal.%20L.%20Rev.%20671" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="81 S.

I respectfully suggest that the outcome of this case turns on the answer to the first question posed on appeal, which question focuses on whether the PHS physicians owed a duty to Appellee when <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>determining whether inmates had MRSA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> In analyzing that question, I conclude that the PHS physicians did owe such a duty to take reasonable care to protect prison guards such as Appellee from acquiring a MRSA infection from infected inmates.</p>

In my view, the alleged failure to warn was a result of the physicians’ alleged failure to properly diagnose MRSA, and therefore pertains more to causation and damages than to duty. That is, the physicians’ alleged failure to properly diagnose MRSA in infected inmates caused the physicians to be unaware of the need and their duty to warn. I therefore conclude that, as applied to the allegations of this case only, any duty to warn is subsumed into the duty the physicians owed to Appellee to properly diagnose MRSA in infected inmates. Finally, with respect to the last two questions, I conclude that imposing a duty here is proper under both <em>DiMarco, supra, </em>and <em>Troxel, supra.</em>
