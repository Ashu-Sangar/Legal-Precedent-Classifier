Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the jury charge in this case, when considered as a whole, adequately instructed the jury that appellee could not be found guilty of first-degree murder as an accomplice or conspirator unless he intended to promote the commission of that crime and shared the intent to commit it. The Commonwealth points to the accomplice and conspiracy liability portions of the charge where the trial court instructed the jury that appellee had to possess the “intent of promoting or facilitating” the commission of the offense in order to be found guilty. Furthermore, the Commonwealth notes that the accomplice liability charge instructed the jury that an accomplice must possess “a shared intent” to commit the crime charged and be “an active partner in the intent which was the crime’s basic element.”</p>

The Commonwealth avers that an appellate court has the authority to modify any appealable order, including a judgment of sentence, pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S. § 706. According to the Commonwealth, this Court has made clear that when an error affects only a discrete element of the offense, the proper remedy is to modify the judgment to a lesser-included offense that does not contain the element.

The Commonwealth contends that the U.S. Supreme Court has also endorsed the practice of modifying a judgment to a lesser-included offense, citing <em>Rutledge v.

The Commonwealth avers that the lower tribunals erred in not following this practice, since the disputed jury instruction had no effect on the jury’s determinations that appellee was guilty of robbery and the victim indisputably was killed by Mayo in the course of that robbery — the twin elements of felony murder. Thus, the lower tribunals should have modified the judgment from first-degree <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>to second-degree murder, an offense that requires the same mandatory sentence of life in prison required for non-capital first-degree murder.</p>

Appellee argues that due process is violated when an instruction reduces the Commonwealth’s burden. The jury instructions in this case relieved the Commonwealth of this burden, appellee says, because the jury was never informed that the Commonwealth must prove that he had the specific intent to kill. Appellee also renews his alternative argument, which was accepted by the PCRA judge, that he and co-defendant Kevin Wyatt were standing side-by-side during the robbery and murder and since Wyatt was granted a new trial on the basis that his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the same jury instruction, he is entitled to identical PCRA relief.</p>

Appellee distinguishes the more recent cases from this Court on the grounds that an otherwise defective jury instruction may be proper when considered in the context of a case, <em>e.g., </em>if the defendant was identified as the principal rather than an accomplice, or where the defendant was charged only with a criminal conspiracy to kill. Thus, appellee distinguishes <em>Commonwealth v. Daniels, </em>a case involving jury instructions similar to the ones issued here, on the factual grounds that the robbery in <em>Daniels </em>was secondary to the murder. In contrast, appellee alleges, robbery was the primary object of the conspiracy here. Additionally, appellee notes, the <em>Daniels </em>Court indicated that the jury there could have found that both defendants were principals in the murder, since the two men <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>acted in concert and both were inculpated in the shooting, depending on whose version of the shooting the jury believed. Conversely, in this case, the jury could not have found that Wyatt or appellee were principals in the murder, since the evidence showed that only Mayo and Johnson went into the store, and Mayo shot the victim; thus, the jury necessarily had to find appellee guilty of first-degree murder as an accomplice (or a conspirator) and not as a principal.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[160,778,1153,850]]]'>Appellee also asserts that the conspiracy instruction in this case made no distinction between vicarious liability for first-degree murder and for the other charged offenses, such as robbery. According to appellee, that instructional error was compounded by the prosecutor’s closing, which argued that if the defendants were part of a conspiracy to commit robbery, they were equally responsible for any murder that occurred during that robbery. Thus, appellee says, the jury could have believed it could convict him of first-degree murder if it merely believed that he shared the intent to commit one of the underlying crimes. Appellee relies on decisional law from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in further support of this position, citing <em>Smith v.

The Court stated the relevant law, which was quoted verbatim in <em>Huffman </em>(and recounted above) related to vicarious liability for first-degree murder, noting that it required evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the accomplice had the specific intent to kill.

The assessment of <em>Strickland </em>prejudice in the context of a case, such as this one, where the murder occurs during the commission of a felony and the ultimate verdict leads to a sentence of life imprisonment, is not as straightforward as might be assumed. In a capital prosecution, a strategy devoted to defeating the first-degree murder charge is obviously salutary, even if there is no realistic prospect for avoiding a verdict of second-degree murder. In non-capital cases, however — or in capital cases where counsel succeeds in avoiding a verdict of death — there is little consolation that the defendant’s mandatory life term results from a second-degree murder verdict rather than one for first-degree murder. Thus, as a practical matter in cases involving murders committed during a felony, like this one, the result counsel secures can properly be faulted on <em>Strickland </em>prejudice grounds only if the course not taken offered a reasonable probability of avoiding a verdict of guilty of second-degree murder.</p>

The trouble often is that, as in the present circumstances, there are other crimes (here, “murder, robbery, possession of an instrument of crime and violation of the Uniform Firearms Act”) mixed into the equation.

In other words, consistent with the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury Instructions, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 580 n. 9, 57 A.3d at 1201 n. 9, the admonition envisioned by the <em>Chester </em>Court should be given, covering both accomplice and conspiratorial liability. <em>Accord Sepulveda, </em><a href="/pa/618/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="618 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="3901111" data-case-paths="/pa/618/0262-01">618 Pa. at 343-46</a>, <a href="/pa/618/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="55 A.3d 1108" data-case-ids="3901111,7312684" data-case-paths="/pa/618/0262-01,/a3d/55/1108-01">55 A.3d at 1157-58</a> (Saylor, J., concurring).</p>

To the extent the majority opinion suggests that ineffectiveness is measured against whether or not there is a controlling case directly on point to guide an attorney’s decision-making, I note that this Court previously has expressly rejected such position. <em>See Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="581 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1140661" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01">581 Pa. 274</a>, 331-32 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6, <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d 761</a>, 795-96 &amp; n. 36 (2004). Moreover, it seems apparent to me, at least, that counsel in a murder case in 1992 — in which his client indisputably did not perpetrate the actual killing — should have been sensitive to the need for the trial court to make clear to the jurors that specific intent to kill was required to support a conviction of first-degree murder under any theory of criminal liability. The <em>Huffman </em>Court derived as much from the pre-existing law, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 571-75, 57 A.3d at 1196-98, and I do not see why the same should not be true for other cases presenting other potentially misleading variants of these essential jury instructions.</p>
