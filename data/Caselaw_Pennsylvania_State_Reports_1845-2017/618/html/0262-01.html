At approximately 6:30 p.m., John Mendez and Ricardo Lopez arrived at the house to recover two guns that Mendez claimed belonged to him. Appellant retrieved the guns and gave them to Mendez. Mendez and Lopez then left.</p>

Mendez and Lopez returned to the house, but Heleva did not initially permit Lopez to enter. Heleva and Mendez had words and the two men began fighting in the kitchen. The fight was resolved and Lopez and appellant joined Mendez and Heleva in the kitchen. Boyko left the house to run an errand for Robyn Otto. Robyn Otto was upstairs in the house with her two children.</p>

He then shot Lopez in the side. Lopez collapsed on the floor. Appellant then placed the gun on Lopez’s back and fired, killing him. Mendez escaped from the kitchen and ran upstairs. Appellant then chased him upstairs where he shot him a second time. Mendez was able to exit the house and flee to a neighbor’s house. Appellant and Heleva followed him, entered the neighbor’s property, seized Mendez, and dragged him back to Heleva’s house. Meanwhile, Frey, who had been watching the incident, hid the shotgun in a sofa. After the men dragged Mendez back to the house, appellant struck him with a hatchet type of weapon, killing him.

Appellant responded: “There is no she. They are in the basement. I shot them.” Police found the dead bodies of Lopez and Mendez in the basement.

Dr. Stewart noted that hypervigilance is a PTSD symptom; in his view, such a symptom would cause a PTSD sufferer to be more likely to react against perceived threats. Dr. Stewart also noted that PTSD includes “avoidance,” a symptom he believed was reflected in appellant’s case by his refusal to discuss the traumatic events in his life. Furthermore, Dr. Stewart opined that PTSD limited appellant’s social and occupational development. Dr. Stewart admitted that appellant was not forthcoming, and that it was his training and experience in psychiatry that enabled him to notice appellant’s indicia of PTSD. Dr. Stewart opined that the fact that a criminal defendant experienced a history of abuse, but did not want his family involved in his defense, was an indicator for PTSD. Dr. Stewart further diagnosed appellant with polysubstance dependence and substance-induced psychotic disorder, which manifests as auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoia. Dr. Stewart also opined that appellant suffered cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (“NOS”), also known as organic brain damage.

It was not requested that I evaluate [appellant] in terms of his past medical and psychiatric history and everything else that would have gone into a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.” N.T., 6/11/07, at 109. Dr. Fine testified that he believed that an in-person evaluation was unnecessary. He concluded that, “while [appellant] might have had impairment of judgment, and possibly some degree of confusion, the material reviewed does not support a conclusion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that he would have been unable to form the specific intent to kill the victims.” Dr. Fine noted that it would have been helpful for him to review additional materials, and appellant’s pre-trial prison records could have indicated whether appellant was then displaying psychotic symptoms. <em>See id. </em>at 115-19.</p>

The court found that appellant had not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he was so overwhelmed by the effects of cocaine that he was incapable of forming the specific intent to kill. Moreover, the court reasoned that counsel had a reasonable basis for not developing and presenting evidence related to appellant’s drug use, as such evidence “could easily have prejudiced the jury against [appellant], portraying him as a drug dealer and addict who was living and conducting business <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>in a known crack house.” PCRA Court Opinion, 10/11/07, at 25.

The case involved the murder of two unarmed men. Each victim, moreover, suffered multiple wounds: appellant shot Lopez twice; he shot Mendez twice and then hatcheted him to death. Furthermore, the killing of Mendez involved time, coordination, and complexity: after killing Lopez, appellant and his co-defendant chased Mendez down to a neighbor’s house and brought him back to finish him off, in a particularly gruesome manner. In addition, the victim’s bodies were quickly moved to and hidden in Heleva’s basement, and time was taken to pose their corpses in positions of humiliation. Appellant had the awareness and presence of mind to confess to the murders immediately after police arrived; although appellant did not act entirely alone, there was no question of identity. These facts made the prospect of <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>any successful defense against first-degree murder extremely challenging. Strategic choices made by trial counsel must be viewed in light of these limiting facts. As in all matters where counsel’s ineffectiveness is being raised, this Court must be careful to assess trial counsel’s performance without the distortion of hindsight, and must instead review the circumstances under which counsel’s decisions were made. <em>Commonwealth v.

A diminished capacity defense “does not exculpate the defendant from criminal liability entirely, but negates the element of specific intent.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, if the jury accepts a diminished capacity defense, a charge of first-degree murder is mitigated to third-degree murder. To establish diminished capacity, a defendant must prove that his cognitive abilities of deliberation and premeditation were so compromised, by mental defect or voluntary intoxication, that he was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill. The mere fact of intoxication does not give rise to a diminished capacity defense. Likewise, evidence that the defendant lacked the ability to control his actions or acted impulsively is irrelevant to specific intent to kill, and thus is not admissible to support a diminished capacity defense. <em><a href="/pa/611/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="25 A.3d 277" data-case-ids="4203681,7275666" data-case-paths="/pa/611/0280-01,/a3d/25/0277-01">Id.</a></em>

This point is true enough, but it is not entirely responsive. The PCRA court’s analysis fails to account for the fact that counsel did not consider the possibility of presenting a diminished capacity defense because he was not aware that there may have been relevant mental health evidence to support such a theory; if he had, a strategic choice might then have been made which would factor in, not only the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>fact that a manslaughter verdict is better than a third-degree murder verdict, but also, the relative strengths of the two defenses, if both were viable.

According to appellant, information in prison records not secured by trial counsel, if reviewed, would have led counsel to seek further information regarding appellant’s mental health, and that information in turn would have led to testimony similar to that presented at the PCRA proceedings. Appellant then posits that this mental health information would have corroborated the defense theory that appellant genuinely, but unreasonably, believed that deadly force was necessary to protect others when he shot Lopez twice; then shot Mendez, chased him through the house and shot him a second time, tracked him down at a neighbor’s house, brought him back, and hacked him to death; then hid the bodies after displaying them in humiliating poses.</p>

However, appellant has not shown that the addition of such testimony, concerning one of the two central aspects of a claim of imperfect belief of defense of others, creates a reasonable probability that the jury would have returned verdicts of involuntary manslaughter. As we noted at the outset, this defense was not particularly strong or plausible, for reasons having to do with circumstances other than appellant’s supposed mental state. Appellant shot two unarmed men, who were doing no more than throwing punches at Heleva. By appellant’s own testimony, the victims were “beating up” Heleva and he “just got scared and grabbed the shotgun” and fired two shots. N.T., 11/21/2002, at 634. Furthermore, the facts also demonstrated that Heleva’s children were upstairs at the time of the incident, while the initial <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>altercation — into which appellant introduced the firearm-was occurring downstairs. Most damning is the fact that appellant and Heleva chased down and dragged the wounded Mendez back to the house before killing him with a hatchet; any self-defense-related claim as to Mendez was clearly doomed by this fact. Certainly, at the time appellant and Heleva chased down Mendez, any belief that others were in imminent danger was objectively unreasonable. Moreover, appellant’s entire course of conduct suggested that he was not free from fault in continuing, and indeed escalating, the difficulty. Under such circumstances, we conclude that appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, if only counsel would have introduced supporting expert testimony on the subjective half of his imperfect defense of others claim, the jury would have credited that his perceptions, if genuinely held, were objectively reasonable. <em>See Light, swpra.</em>

But, there are other ways to build a case in mitigation, and appellant’s directive did not absolve counsel of the duty to gather meaningful information concerning appellant’s life history, such as school records or records related to his incarceration. Nor, by its terms, did appellant’s directive not to involve family members equate to a directive not to investigate and present a case in mitigation through other means. Notably, counsel possessed at least rudimentary knowledge of appellant’s background via counsel’s paralegal; there was nothing to prevent counsel from seeking school records to augment that knowledge.

In this matter, there was such other evidence. The record confirms that counsel consulted with no mental health expert regarding possible mitigating evidence. Indeed, counsel did not contact Dr. Fine until November 15, 2002, the same day that the Commonwealth presented its first witness at trial. The record further shows that counsel’s interaction with Dr. Fine did not encompass potential mitigation evidence, but instead, was specifically limited to determining whether appellant’s use of cocaine interfered with his ability to form the specific intent to kill required for capital murder. We have concluded in a similar situation that counsel’s singular focus on cocaine-induced psychosis as the key to the guilt phase, coupled with a disregard for other forms of mental health mitigating evidence which would have been useful at the penalty phase, cannot be said to have been a reasonable strategy. <em>Commonwealth v.

But a raw lack of racial or gender equivalency in a party’s use of peremptory challenges alone does prove purposeful discrimination in jury selection, much less discrimination so overt that trial counsel was obliged to object. <em>See Ligons, </em>971 A.2d at 1144 (racially disproportion<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>ate number of peremptory challenges “in and of itself, is insufficient to demonstrate purposeful discrimination when considering the totality of the circumstances.”)- Moreover, the record supports the PCRA court’s conclusion that there was no indication of purposeful discrimination here.

Further, nothing in the transcript indicates any gender-based bias or animus. In a case involving a similar <em>Batson!Strickland </em>claim premised upon raw data and hindsight, we held that there was no gender-based purposeful discrimination when the prosecutor removed nine female potential jurors, four women served on the jury, and the prosecutor accepted four women who were later struck by the defense. <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/587/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="896 A.2d 1191" data-case-ids="3465881,8431353" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0001-01,/a2d/896/1191-01">896 A.2d at 1212-13</a>.

Further, the PCRA court found that the trooper could not recall what appellant actually said, but reviewed the transcript, correcting it only when it was inconsistent with the recording and his notes. Thus, the trooper never understood appellant to have used the word “fighting.” The PCRA court found that appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was meritless, further noting that, because counsel offered an alternative interpretation of the recording, the jury was well aware that the content of the transcript was in question.

Thus, counsel called his secretary, who stated that she believed that the disputed word was “pulling,” thereby apprising the jury that the Commonwealth’s transcription was in doubt.

The PCRA court further determined that there was no indication that the victims’ families displayed the victims’ photographs at trial. In fact, the PCRA court noted that it “clearly recalled] that no such extra-record victim impact evidence was present in the courtroom during either phase of [appellant’s] trial and such evidence would not have been permitted.

Appellant argues that the instruction confused the jury, preventing it from properly deciding his imperfect belief of defense of others claim. Next, appellant alleges that counsel was required to object after the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, appellant’s imperfect belief of defense of others claim, if it is to prove malice, and thus murder.

The court also stated, at that point, that it would be instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter later in the charge. <em>See id. </em>at 789, 791.

In early November of 2003, after the direct appeal briefs were filed, and soon before this Court heard oral argument in appellant’s direct appeal, Pazuhanich was elected to the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County. On November 29, 2003, five days before the direct appeal was argued in this Court, Judge-elect Pazuhanich was arrested in Luzerne County on charges unrelated to his duties as a prosecutor involving the indecent assault of a child. On July 12, 2004, Pazuhanich pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>in the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas to two counts of indecent assault, one count of endangering the welfare of children, one count of corruption of minors, and the summary offense of public drunkenness. The court sentenced him to ten years’ probation and directed him to comply with and register pursuant to Megan’s Law II (42 Pa.C.S. § 9791 <em>et seq.).</em>

Counsel stated unequivocally that his involvement was only “in the very beginning and at the end.” Counsel testified that he never advised appellant of his representation of Pazuhanich.

Moreover, as discussed previously, there was no indication other than mere (select) numbers that Pazuhanich employed peremptory challenges in a gender-biased manner.

Setting aside that this is another leap in logic that is not at all self-evident, appellant points to nothing in his prosecution that demonstrates Pazuhanich’s anti-drug dealer bias. Moreover, there is no requirement that prosecutors must like drug dealers before they prosecute them for murder. In any event, long before Pazuhanich prosecuted appellant, he had confessed to the killings; and a jury then found him guilty, following sworn testimony in which he again admitted his role.

Our review of the record indicates that appellant has not demonstrated that this discovery request was anything other than a fishing expedition — there is no indication that anything in these files, from an unrelated prosecution, in another county, a year after appellant’s trial, would be exculpatory or otherwise relevant to this matter, which had already been briefed on appeal by the time of Pazuhanich’s arrest. Moreover, the prosecution of Pazuhanich in Luzerne County was unrelated to his prosecutorial duties in Monroe County.

During the PCRA proceedings, appellant touched upon the transcription issue, but when counsel responded that a request for transcription depended upon “what is being discussed,” appellant did not follow up on counsel’s response by pointing to instances in the trial record where counsel could have or should have requested transcription.

This argument is frivolous. Appellant cites to a workers’ compensation case and Wigmore on Evidence in support of his "adverse inference” theory rather than governing case law involving a collateral attack on a criminal conviction, premised upon a <em>standard </em>— Strickland.—that establishes a presumption of counsel's competence. Moreover, the legal principles cited by appellant do not support his theory, but, instead, say only that an "adverse inference” may be appropriate when a workers' compensation claimant (the party with the burden) fails to produce evidence in support of his claims. Here, appellant is the claimant and it is his burden to prove his claims of ineffectiveness, including presenting evidence in support of his mental health claims. The Commonwealth has no such burden. The Commonwealth properly disputed appellant’s hired experts’ testimony through cross-examination. Moreover, although counter-expert evidence can certainly make the Commonwealth’s task on collateral attack easier — in this Court’s experience, mental health expert testimony in capital PCRA matters very frequently is contradictory — the Commonwealth is not obliged to go to the expense of procuring expert opinion rebuttal merely because the FCDO apparently is so flush with financial resources that it secures multiple and overlapping experts to support its theories.</p>

Notably, although appellant was tried in 2002, he relies almost exclusively on the 2003 ABA Guidelines in criticizing counsel. Counsel obviously cannot be expected to conform to ABA Guidelines which did not exist at the time of trial. Appellant does note that earlier versions of the ABA Guidelines exist and he cites, once, to the 1989 ABA Guidelines. However, this one citation is mere boilerplate, and does not prove that counsel deviated from the opinions and recommendations in the 1989 ABA Guidelines, much less that the 1989 ABA Guidelines reflected the prevailing professional norms in Pennsylvania at the time of appellant’s trial. As presented, then, appellant's reliance on ABA standards is frivolous.</p>

      <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>Here, the PCRA court found appellant opposed any investigation into his background. This finding is supported by the record. Counsel noted appellant did not wish to involve his family members. Appellant’s family members consistently testified appellant did not ask for their assistance, or even inform them of the seriousness of the charges, until after he was sentenced to death. Had appellant wanted counsel to investigate evidence from his background, including the alleged domestic abuse he suffered, it is unlikely he would have instructed counsel not to contact his family while downplaying the severity of the charges against him to his family members. Further, even though Alex Sepulveda, appellant’s relative, is an attorney whose family members frequently asked for help with their legal problems, appellant did not once contact him before sentencing. Thus, where appellant consistently opposed investigating his background, I do not believe he has proven counsel was unreasonable in not investigating that background.</p>
    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[145,1333,1152,1025]]]'>Further, the PCRA court concluded counsel had no reason to believe appellant suffered from mental health issues. I would find this conclusion is supported by the record, as Dr. Puente noted the information appellant provided about his background was “not enough to put up a red flag.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/12/07, at 74. Further, Dr. Stewart admitted someone without mental health training would not be able to notice appellant’s indicia of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/07, at 93. Thus, it was not obvious to counsel that appellant was suffering from a mental health problem. Further, counsel did consult a mental health expert, Dr. Fine, who reviewed appellant’s confession and concluded an in-person evaluation was unnecessary. Accordingly, pursuant to the prevailing professional norms at the time of counsel’s performance, I would conclude counsel’s “ ‘decision not to seek more’ mitigating evidence from [appellant’s background, ... fell ‘well within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.’ ” <em>Bobby, </em>at 19, <a href="/us/558/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="297" data-cite="558 U.S. 4" data-case-ids="3638939" data-case-paths="/us/558/0004-01">130 S.Ct. 13</a> (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>at 699,<a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="298" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>).</p>

      <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>As to the issue of appellant’s pre-trial prison records, the PCRA court concluded these records did not contain any “red flags” because stress from facing trial on capital charges could have caused appellant’s symptoms. Although Dr. Stewart noted guilt could have caused appellant’s symptoms, appellant’s experts consistently testified neither stress nor guilt could have caused appellant’s hallucinations. Thus, I would hold the record does not support the PCRA court’s conclusion that stress could have caused the symptoms recorded in appellant’s pre-trial prison records.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[272,863,1150,790]]]'>Nonetheless, I do not believe appellant has proven counsel acted unreasonably in not reviewing these records. The PCRA court determined appellant did not demonstrate any obvious signs of mental illness, and Dr. Fine did not inform counsel that appellant had mental health issues. As counsel had no indication appellant suffered from any mental illness, he acted reasonably in not reviewing prison records for signs of an illness he had no cause to believe existed. Additionally, appellant opposed any investigation into his background. Thus, counsel did not have any reason to ignore his own observations of appellant, Dr. Fine’s advice, and his client’s wishes, by reviewing appellant’s prison records in hopes of uncovering signs of mental illness. Accordingly, I would hold appellant has failed to establish counsel was ineffective in not reviewing his prison records.</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[274,1677,1149,682]],["BL_427.1",427,[149,318,1150,88]]]'>As a result, I cannot agree counsel’s performance was deficient, thus requiring a remand for the PCRA court to conduct a prejudice inquiry. While hindsight always provides this Court with a clear view of the most prudent path counsel could have taken, that path here was blurred for counsel by appellant’s lack of cooperation and desire to keep his background and family out of the courtroom. The lack of red flags and reasons to further investigate appellant’s pre-trial prison records distorted matters even further. Although we now have a 20-20 view of a better path counsel could have taken, our governing case law instructs us not to be swayed by this view, but rather by the reasonableness of the chosen path. Because I find counsel’s pursuit to have been reasonable, I <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>must respectfully disagree with the majority’s decision to remand to the PCRA court.</p>
