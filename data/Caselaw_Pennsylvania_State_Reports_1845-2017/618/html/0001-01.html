In May of that year, Lane told Melendez and Appellant that Jason Bolton (“the victim”), a rival drug dealer, had stolen Lane’s gold chain and money. Appellant responded by telling Lane that he was going to kill the victim in retribution. Sometime thereafter, Appellant learned that the victim had made threats against him. The next month, on June 11, 1997, Appellant was at the home of LaDonna Johnson ■with Melendez, Richard Boxley, and Tamika Johnson. While there, Tamika heard Appellant state that the victim had 48 hours to five because he had robbed Lane. Shortly thereafter, at Appellant’s request, Melendez and Boxley left the house to buy cigars at a corner store, and observed the victim walking down the street. Boxley then ran to tell Appellant the victim’s whereabouts.</p>

After the victim turned a corner, Appellant directed Melendez to see where he went. Melendez reported that the victim was standing on the street and speaking to someone on the second floor of a house. Additionally, three people were standing across the street near a church, children were playing outside, and a woman was sitting on a nearby porch.</p>

As Boxley walked toward the victim, Boxley’s gun accidentally discharged in his back pants pocket. Boxley then ran toward the victim, firing his gun. The victim did not draw a weapon. Appellant, who had been following a few steps behind Boxley during the incident, fired two shots in the victim’s direction over the heads of the children playing in the street. The victim ran up onto a porch and entered the building. In response, Boxley fired his gun into the vestibule of the building that the victim had entered, killing him.</p>

Tamika Johnson was also present at LaDonna’s house and observed the three men celebrating. Appellant told Tamika to go to the crime scene and determine whether the victim had died. When she returned and reported that the victim was dead, Appellant and Melendez remained celebratory, while Boxley appeared frightened. Melendez then left for his mother’s house to hide the murder weapons, which were later recovered by police. Appellant was subsequently arrested in New York City for the shooting. He provided statements to New York City police officers, and later to Reading police officers, indicating, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had followed the victim on the street and fired two shots at him from his 9 millimeter revolver.</p>

He stated that the Commonwealth did not make any promises or agreements in exchange for his testimony against Appellant, although he hoped for leniency in return for his cooperation. Tamika Johnson testified that, on the day of the murder, she saw Appellant in possession of a firearm, heard him state that the victim had 48 hours to live because he had robbed Lane, and observed Appellant celebrating after the murder. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of a ballistics expert, who opined that the bullet fragments and shell casings recovered from the crime scene matched the 9 millimeter revolvers recovered by police.

Thus, it concluded that the statement was not unlawfully obtained. Moreover, consistent with the Commonwealth’s argument, the PCRA court held that the statement was admissible to impeach Appellant’s credibility even if a <em>Miranda </em>violation had occurred because a voluntary confession that was suppressed on <em>Miranda </em>grounds may be used on rebuttal to impeach a defendant’s testimony.

      <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>The PCRA court addressed Appellant’s claim of trial and appellate counsel ineffectiveness on the merits, and denied relief. Initially, it rejected the conclusions of Appellant’s mental health experts who opined at the PCRA hearing that he was acting under an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and that his capacity to appreciate the criminal nature of his conduct was substantially impaired at the time of the shooting. PCRA Court Opinion, Feb. 7, 2011, at 64. Further, crediting trial counsel’s testimony regarding his mitigation strategy, the PCRA court held that under the circumstances of the particular case, it was reasonable for trial counsel to argue for life imprisonment on the basis of Appellant’s youth and diminished culpability as an accomplice, instead of on grounds of mental infirmity. Finally, it noted that Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel’s performance because, considering the evidence of premeditation and control over the execution of the murder, it was unlikely that the jury would have concluded that Petitioner acted under an extreme emotional or mental disturbance or an impaired capacity to appreciate the criminal nature of his conduct.</p>

It emphasized that appellate counsel could not present a diagnosis from the mental health expert because Appellant refused to submit to testing. The PCRA court noted that, nevertheless, appellate counsel presented the testimony of the mental health expert who, based upon a review of mental health records from Appellant’s childhood, opined that Appellant likely suffered from organic brain damage which led to his impulsive behavior. Further, it noted that appellate counsel called several of Appellant’s relatives as witnesses at the post-trial evidentiary hearing, who testified that Appellant <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>was a good person who got along well with his family.

The record supports the PCRA court’s findings that Appellant failed to submit to a mental health evaluation, which was fatal to his claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Appellate counsel cannot be deemed ineffective when it was Appellant who refused to cooperate in his own mitigation defense by submitting to a mental health evaluation. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, appellate counsel made other efforts to support the claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. He presented the testimony of Dr. Russell at the post-trial evidentiary hearing who, based on his review of Appellant’s childhood social service and mental health records, opined that Appellant likely suffered from brain damage as a child, which could lead to impulsive behavior. Also, appellate counsel sought a continuance when Appellant changed his mind during the post-trial evidentiary hearing, and agreed to be examined by the mental health professional. On appeal, appellate counsel further raised a separate challenge to the trial court’s denial of the continuance. Finally, appellate counsel called several of Appellant’s relatives as witnesses in an effort to present additional mitigation evidence.</p>

Within his ineffectiveness claim relating to mental health mitigation evidence, Appellant additionally challenges appellate counsel’s stewardship for failing to investigate and present evidence documenting his traumatic childhood, including his learning difficulties and endurance of mental and physical abuse. On direct appeal, when disposing of Appellant's claim relating to mental health mitigation, this Court rejected Appellant’s reliance on evidence of his troubled childhood as a source of mitigation evidence. <em>See Busanet, </em><a href="/pa/572/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="817 A.2d 1060" data-case-ids="716441,9368884" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0535-01,/a2d/817/1060-01">817 A.2d at 1073</a> (holding that the evidence of a troubled childhood cited by Appellant was distinguishable in nature and quality from that presented in <em>Williams v.

Thus, the claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness has been previously litigated on direct appeal, and is not cognizable under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(a)(3). To the extent that Appellant preserved any challenge to appellate counsel’s performance in failing to litigate the issue effectively on appeal, this claim fails for lack of merit as Appellant has not identified what course of action appellate counsel omitted or overlooked. In fact, he concedes that "the evidence that appellate counsel presented was significant, and should have been sufficient to show that trial counsel was ineffective, but only scratched the surface of what would have been available had counsel undertaken a reasonably thorough investigation.” Brief of Appellant at 68. This is insufficient to satisfy Appellant’s burden of demonstrating that appellate counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient.</p>

I support the majority’s holding affirming the order of the post-conviction court as to the guilt phase based on an evaluation of the prejudice criterion of the ineffective inquiry, again, in view of the strong evidence of guilt. However, given the significant possibility of spillover prejudice which may have affected the penalty determination, I would vacate the death verdict and remand for a new sentencing hearing.</p>
