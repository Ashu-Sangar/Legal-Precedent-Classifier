Relevant to the question of whether the legislature intended to require lifetime registration in situations where the multiple convictions stemmed from acts which were part of one criminal episode, I deem the legislature, through the use of the unadorned language, “[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a),” to have elected not to require any particular sequential or temporal ordering of the multiple convictions in order for the lifetime registration requirements to apply. Rather, the legislature simply mandated that, at the point in time at which a defendant acquires two or more convictions for specified sexual offenses against children, the registration requirement is triggered. Since the legislature decided not to include language implicating the timing of the convictions, I do not believe we may judicially engraft such a requirement. <em>See generally Johnson, supra </em>(it is improper as a matter of statutory interpretation to add a provision to a statute which the legislature did not include). Consequently, because the timing of the multiple convictions is irrelevant under this <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>statutory provision — even when two convictions arise out of two separate criminal acts against a single victim committed during one criminal episode, as Appellant claims — I believe lifetime registration is compelled. <em>Cf.

This, from my perspective, evidences a deliberate legislative judgment, consistent with its objective of protecting public safety, to make the differing length of registration requirements dependent not only on the nature of the specific sexual offenses for which an individual is convicted, but, also, on the occurrence of a multiplicity of certain types of offenses, particularly those committed against children. In my view, this reflects a considered determination by the legislature that, in order to protect the safety and general welfare of the public, the frequency with which a convicted defendant is determined to have engaged in certain types of prohibited conduct with children is a particularly important factor in determining whether he or she should be subject to lifetime registration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

That offender would be automatically considered no different for registration purposes from defendants who commit the most serious violent offenses against minors and children, such as rape and incest, and who are formally deemed sexually violent predators. Appellant explains that in light of the nonviolent nature of his offenses, his voluntary submission to treatment and therapy, and the testimony by Dr. Bernstein that appellant is a “good candidate” for rehabilitation and reform, ten-year registration, along with supervised probation and continued counseling, is appropriate and sufficient while lifetime registration is disproportionately severe.

In <em>Merolla, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and one count of statutory sexual assault upon three different victims in separate incidents over several years. While not belittling the seriousness or “repugnance” of his own offenses, appellant compares his own lack of any past offenses, the nonviolent nature of the actions he committed here, which occurred in the course of a single criminal episode over a few weeks, and notes that since he was apprehended through a sting operation, no actual minor or child victims were harmed. Appellant adds that the rapid recent advancement of technology, such as internet chatting, makes it possible now for more than one enumerated offense, such as obscenity or unlawful contact, to occur during a single online encounter that would subject the offender to lifetime registration. To appellant, this result seems incongruous with how Megan’s Law was intended to operate when it was adopted in 1995 and when the two-tiered registration provision was enacted in 2000.

At that time, the second-time offender minimum was five years; it is now ten years. The defendant in <em>Dickerson </em>committed two rapes of two different women on the same night. He was convicted by a jury of the first rape in 1988 and sentenced to seven and one-half to fifteen years in prison. <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>He pleaded guilty to the second rape in 1989 and was sentenced under Section 9714 to seven and one-half years in prison, consecutive to the first sentence. This Court, however, held that Section 9714 did not apply because in the defendant’s case, the first rape conviction in 1988 did not occur within seven years prior to commission of the rape that led to the second conviction. This conclusion was based in part upon analysis of the statutory language, but also upon the “recidivist philosophy” that was found to be implicated. Although the Court did not use the term “recidivist philosophy,” the theory was embodied in the <em>Dickerson </em>Court’s view that legislation such as Section 9714 aims “to punish more severely offenders who have persevered in criminal activity despite the theoretically beneficial effects of penal discipline.” <em>Id. </em>at 992.

We would therefore hold that a defendant convicted of “two or more” subsection (a) offenses are subject to the lesser sanction of the ten-year registration requirement so long as it is clear that the offenses were part of the same course of criminal conduct.

Here, however, Appellant was convicted of two of the offenses enumerated in Section 9795.1(a)(1) for two separate criminal acts involving one minor victim, and he engaged in a repeated pattern of criminal conduct involving similar behavior for a four-month period; hence, this case does not present the question of whether Section 9795.1(b)(1) requires imposition of lifetime registration in instances where a defendant is convicted of two or more of the offenses listed in Section 9795.1(a)(1) for only one criminal act.</p>
