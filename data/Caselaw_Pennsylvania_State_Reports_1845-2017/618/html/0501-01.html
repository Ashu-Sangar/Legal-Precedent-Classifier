The <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>matter was assigned to Senior Judge Sheldon Jelin, who denied the motion and scheduled the case for trial.</p>

SEPTA filed post-trial motions which Judge Jelin granted in part, and he awarded SEPTA a new trial. Judge Jelin dismissed SEPTA’s renewed motion for summary judgment as moot. Davis appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed Judge Jelin’s order granting a new trial and directed Judge Jelin to address SEPTA’s motion for summary judgment on the issue of sovereign immunity.

Appellants also point out that the Act 44 funding levels for 2008, 2009, and 2010, cited by the Commonwealth Court, were guaranteed for only those three years, and funding beyond that time period was contingent upon the federal government approving Pennsylvania’s request to toll 1-80, which was denied. Thus, since anticipated funding from that source will not materialize due to the denial of Pennsylvania’s tolling application, the total state subsidy to SEPTA will be diminished correspondingly. Consequently, Appellants maintain that the Commonwealth Court’s assumption that the amount of state subsidy would indefinitely remain at those levels, thereby ensuring a greater degree of control by the Commonwealth, was, in hindsight, flawed. In sum, Appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court erred by improperly ignoring all of these factors which, in their view, lead to the conclusion that SEPTA cannot be classified as an arm of the Commonwealth.</p>

SEPTA argues that this concern is implicated presently since it is so heavily dependent on state subsidies, which it estimates to be in excess of $750,000,000. SEPTA contends that “exposing SEPTA to a multitude of FELA claims has an impact on the Commonwealth’s treasury and injures the Commonwealth itself.” SEPTA Brief at 21. In SEPTA’s view, exposing it to FELA liability “undermines the ability of the Commonwealth to govern its own affairs and thereby strikes at the core of sovereignty.” <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>

The decision proved controversial, and many historians believe that a substantial part of the motivation for the Eleventh Amendment’s subsequent enactment was the states’ fear that the <em>Chisholm </em>decision would encourage a multiplicity of such suits by creditors, including those of British subjects and Tory loyalists whose property had been seized during the Revolution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Facially, the Eleventh Amendment would seem to have no applicability in barring suits against an entity such as SEPTA which is not a state, or in precluding suits by a state’s residents in its own courts against such a state-created entity.</p>

Second, while neither the compact nor the enabling legislation which created the Port Authority characterized it as a state agency, decisions of state courts treated it as such. Third, the Court stated that the nature of the functions provided by the Port Authority — i.e. owning and operating bridges, tunnels, ferries, marine terminals, airports, bus terminals, industrial parks and commuter railroads — did not aid its Eleventh Amendment analysis because such activities were conducted by both states and local municipal governments and, thus, were not the exclusive province of either type of entity. Fourth, the states which created the Port Authority had no financial responsibility for it, due to the fact it was created as a financially independent entity with private funds and, because it generated its own revenue through its operations, it received no money from its creating states.

Thus, under the current funding scheme established by Act 44, no matter what the annual amount of the Commonwealth’s assistance to SEPTA, local governments’ contributions will likely be at or near this minimum proportional level. <em>See <a href="/pa/600/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="180" data-cite="965 A.2d 226" data-case-ids="4193043,8157519" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0277-01,/a2d/965/0226-01">id.</a> </em>§ 1513(d)(2) (requiring that, in the event that local matching funds fail to meet the 15% threshold in a given fiscal year, <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>those contributions must increase in subsequent fiscal years until the 15% threshold is reached).

In such a suit, the Commonwealth is not a named defendant, as SEPTA has been designated by the legislature of the Commonwealth as a distinct legal entity with the power to sue and be sued in its own capacity. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S.A. § 1701 (defining an authority as a “body corporate and politic”); 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 1741 (granting an authority the power to sue and be sued). Thus, it is not any purported negligent act of the Commonwealth at issue in a FELA suit, but, rather, the alleged negligent act of SEPTA itself. Neither can the Commonwealth be joined as a defendant in any FELA action against SEPTA since the Commonwealth has specifically repudiated any legal responsibility for obligations incurred by SEPTA; hence, having explicitly disclaimed all responsibility for any financial liability incurred by SEPTA, it may not be joined in a FELA suit against SEPTA under our rules of civil procedure. <em>See </em>Pa. R.C.P. 1706.1, 2252(a)(1), (4) (allowing joinder by plaintiff or defendant in a civil action of only those parties which are solely liable to the plaintiff, liable to the joining party, or jointly or severally liable with the joining party on the plaintiffs cause of action). Further, the Commonwealth does not enter its appearance to defend a FELA suit on SEPTA’s behalf, and it does not otherwise participate in the litigation, as the legislature has explicitly placed the responsibility on SEPTA to manage all of its own legal affairs, which responsibility includes the defense of any suits against it. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S.A. § 1722(a) (establishing a legal division which “shall administer the legal affairs of the authority, shall prosecute <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>and defend, settle or compromise all suits or claims for and on behalf of the authority.”).

Judge Alejandro found, and the parties apparently conceded, FELA was promulgated pursuant to Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and, thus, in her view, pursuant to <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>Congress could not have abrogated a state’s sovereign immunity under this act even if it had so intended. We express no opinion on this conclusion as we did not accept review to address that question. Because both parties agreed below that FELA does not abrogate the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth, we will assume, for the purposes of our review, the truth of this proposition.</p>

The Third Circuit’s arm-of-the-state test incorporates many of the same considerations articulated in <em>Lake Country </em>and <em>Hess, </em>along with additional factors. <em>See Fitchik, </em><a href="/f2d/873/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="226" data-cite="873 F.2d 655" data-case-ids="10533708" data-case-paths="/f2d/873/0655-01">873 F.2d at 659</a>. <em>Fitchik </em>reaffirmed that the "most important” factor remained whether any judgment against the entity would be paid from the state treasury which was consistent with the view of the high Court at that time that the central purpose of the amendment was to protect the state treasury against federal judgments. However, in the aftermath of <em>Regents </em>and <em>Federal Maritime, </em>the Third Circuit, while continuing to utilize the <em>Fitchik </em>test, regards the high Court’s holdings in those cases as requiring alteration of the application of the test such that consideration of the impact of a judgment on the state treasury should no longer be accorded primacy. Thus, the Third Circuit now assigns equal weight to all of its <em>Fitchik </em>factors in conducting its arm-of-the-state analysis. <em>See Cooper, </em><a href="/f3d/548/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="227" data-cite="548 F.3d 296" data-case-ids="3952755" data-case-paths="/f3d/548/0296-01">548 F.3d at 301</a> ("We still consider all three <em>[Fitchik </em>] factors relevant in assessing whether an entity warrants Eleventh Amendment protection, but none is predominant.”).</p>

In this respect, we agree with Appellants that statutory provisions and interpretive decisions of our Court, in and of themselves, do not establish SEPTA's sovereign immunity for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. As then Judge, now Justice, Alito observed in <em>Bolden, </em>acceptance of the proposition that a state could determine the scope of its sovereign immunity via statutory designation alone "would revolutionize the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment,” as "each state legislature apparently could confer Eleventh Amendment protection on any entity that it wished, including counties and cities, by enacting a statute clothing these entities with ‘sovereign immunity' from suit on state claims.” <em>Bolden, </em><a href="/f2d/953/0807-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="953 F.2d 807" data-case-ids="10519415" data-case-paths="/f2d/953/0807-01">953 F.2d at </a>818 (citing <em>Howlett, supra.) </em>Doing so would conflict with the high Court's determination that a state’s immunity from suit is not externally bestowed by legislative or constitutional fiat, but is rather "a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today ... except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.” <em>Alden, </em><a href="/us/527/0706-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="527 U.S. 706" data-case-ids="1248280" data-case-paths="/us/527/0706-01">527 U.S. at 713</a>, <a href="/us/527/0706-01" class="citation" data-index="233" data-cite="527 U.S. 706" data-case-ids="1248280" data-case-paths="/us/527/0706-01">119 S.Ct. 2240</a>.</p>
