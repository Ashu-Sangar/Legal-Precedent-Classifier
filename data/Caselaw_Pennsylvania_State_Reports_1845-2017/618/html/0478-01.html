Blood tests were undertaken, and the laboratory reports were suggestive of cancer. Mrs. Anderson underwent exploratory surgery, performed by Dr. McAfoos, who found a tumor at the junction of her small and large intestines, removed it along with segments of the intestines and lymph nodes, and resected the remaining intestines. Post-surgery laboratory reports indicated that Mrs. Anderson did suffer from cancer, which had advanced beyond the tumor.</p>

On the last day of her hospital stay, Mrs. Anderson’s progress was assessed by Dr. McAfoos’s practice associate, Thomas E. Serena, M.D., also a general surgeon, who was covering for Dr. McAfoos during his absence. Medical notes indicated that Mrs. Anderson’s temperature continued to fluctuate into low-grade fever stages, and blood tests had revealed the formation of immature white blood cells. Mrs. Anderson had otherwise shown improvement in her post-surgical recovery, and she wished to go home. Dr. Serena discharged her that day, October 10, 2001, while prescribing follow-up Woodwork.</p>

Dr. Serena removed more segments from the intestines and performed a colostomy, but Mrs. Anderson later died from the sepsis, or her body’s traumatic response to the blood infection.</p>

The primary provision of the MCARE Act at issue here is Section 512(c), which provides as follows: <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>STANDARD OF CARE. — In addition to the requirements set forth in subsections (a) and (b), an expert testifying as to a physician’s standard of care also must meet the following qualifications:</p>
      <blockquote id="b574-7" data-blocks='[["BL_574.3",574,[374,1731,1047,108]]]'>(1) Be substantially familiar with the applicable standard of care for the specific care at issue as of the time of the alleged breach of the standard of care.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b574-8" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[374,1849,1048,151]]]'>(2) Practice in the same subspecialty as the defendant physician or in a subspecialty which has a substantially similar standard of care for the specific care at issue, except as provided in subsection (d) or (e).</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b574-9" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[373,2005,1048,116]]]'>(3) In the event the defendant physician is certified by an approved board, be board certified by the same or a similar approved board, except as provided in subsection (e).</blockquote>

      <p id="b574-11" data-blocks='[["BL_574.11",574,[274,2192,1149,155]]]'>. This law developed under the far more liberal common law standards for the admission of expert testimony, and now is being employed uncritically in the MCARE Act scenario, where there is a far greater likelihood that the plaintiff's expert may be disqualified as incompetent.</p>
