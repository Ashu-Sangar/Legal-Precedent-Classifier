Admittedly, the language directing an elector to “sign” and print his “name” is ambiguous, as it does not delineate expressly what form of an elector’s name is acceptable.

Specifically, the court held that it was not required to strike signatures where the elector omits his or her middle initial, a marital prefix, or suffix, such as “Jr.” or “Sr.” Under those circumstances, the court reasoned, the elector’s signature admittedly contains a defect, but that such defect is so insignificant as to not be a material error. <em><a href="/pa-commw/163/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="643 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="1459879,7867016" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/163/0430-01,/a2d/643/0717-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/163/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="643 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="1459879,7867016" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/163/0430-01,/a2d/643/0717-01">at 726</a>.

The Commonwealth Court found that it would be totally unreasonable to require electors to remember whether they used a middle initial when they completed the voter’s affidavit, in some instances, twenty or thirty years before. <em><a href="/pa-commw/163/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="643 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="1459879,7867016" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/163/0430-01,/a2d/643/0717-01">Id.</a></em>

We find that the obvious diminutive forms of first names at issue here are more akin to an elector’s omission of either a middle initial or a designation as “Jr.” or “Sr.,” which have both been found to be immaterial defects that do not invalidate the signature. We emphasize that in all challenges to nomination petitions, each signature will have to be examined independently to determine whether, in fact, the diminutive form of the name appearing on the nomination petition is an obvious substitute for the formal name. Such case-by-case determinations are not novel to election cases, in which courts routinely examine each challenged signature individually.</p>

      <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>Finally, we reconcile our holding herein with our previous holding in <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>where we ruled that the Commonwealth Court erred by failing to strike signatures that did not reflect the name or address that appeared on the electors’ voter registration card. In <em>Flaherty, </em>the objectors challenged signatures on the ground that the electors printed their name as opposed to signed their name on the nomination petition. This Court agreed. Citing the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Cooper, </em>we stated that “[a]n elector’s name will be stricken where the elector prints his name upon a candidate’s nomination petition so that it does not match his signature on his voter registration card.” <em>Id. </em>at 332. Notably, this holding in no way involved an elector’s use of an obvious shortened version of his or her first name, but rather was grounded in the mandate of Section 908 of the Election Code, which required electors to “sign” rather than print their name to a candidate’s nomination petition. 25 P.S. § 2868. As noted, there is no corresponding provision of the Election Code that requires electors to sign their formal first name when a diminutive form of the same is obvious.</p>

This Court agreed with the objectors that such signatures should have been stricken because the Election Code contained stringent requirements regarding an elector’s registration of his address, and an elector’s notification to authorities of any change of address. Thus, our decision in <em>Flaherty </em>instructs that signatures that differ from the name on the elector’s voter registration card in a material way that violates the Election Code should be stricken. We did not hold, however, that a signature is invalid if there is any difference between the elector’s signature on a nomination petition and the name that appears on the elector’s voter registration card. <em>See Piccirilli, </em><a href="/a2d/944/0840-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="944 A.2d 840" data-case-ids="8385973" data-case-paths="/a2d/944/0840-01">944 A.2d at 842-43</a> (providing that this Court’s decision in <em>“Flaherty </em>does not mean that any and all defects in the signature would require that the signature be stricken— only substantial ones”). Because the electors herein signed <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>obvious shortened versions of their first names, the defects were immaterial and did not invalidate the signatures.</p>

It is for these reasons that this Court entered the order on April 4, 2012, reversing the order of the Commonwealth Court, and directing that Candidate’s name be printed on the April 24, 2012 primary election ballot.</p>
