    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[148,532,1152,948]]]'>Ms. Madeline Scampone resided at Highland Park, a nursing home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1998 to 2004. She received skilled nursing care for a number of chronic ailments, including senile dementia, osteoporosis, pulmonary disease, and hypertension. Ms. Scampone was also susceptible to developing urinary tract infections; indeed, she was hospitalized repeatedly upon such diagnosis in June 2002, July 2003, October 2003, and December 2003. During her 2003 hospitalizations, staff also noted a degradation in Ms. Scampone’s mental status. Following admission in December 2003, Ms. Scampone remained hospitalized for three days, after which she returned to Highland Park in good condition. On January 30, 2004, however, the hospital re-admitted Ms. Scampone, diagnosing her with yet another urinary tract infection, dehydration, malnutrition, bedsores, and an acute myocardial infarction. On February 9, 2004, Ms. Scampone died of a heart attack at the age of 94. Following his mother’s death, Richard Scampone was appointed executor of her estate.</p>

Ness, parties with direct or indirect ownership interests in Highland Park.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the complaint, the Scampone estate asserted claims of negligence under the Survival Act and of wrongful death, and requested compensatory and punitive damages, costs of litigation, and other relief that the court could find proper. Appellee proceeded on theories of (1) corporate negligence, or appellants’ direct liability, and (2) <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>appellants’ vicarious liability for the negligent acts of their employees and other agents. The matter went to trial on May 14, 2007, before the Honorable Robert J. Colville.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[275,485,1149,1475]]]'>At trial, the Scampone estate offered evidence — primarily testimony of nurses and certified nursing assistants, former Highland Park employees — regarding the care provided to Ms. Scampone during the period leading up to the end of her stay at the nursing home and subsequent death. These former employees testified that they often lacked time to accomplish the tasks assigned to them in the care plans of all residents, including distributing water, and tracking with regularity the daily activities, food and water intake, output, and medications provided to Ms. Scampone. Moreover, witnesses stated that staff at Highland Park failed to inform Ms. Scam-pone’s doctors and family of changes in her condition, and failed to follow doctors’ orders regarding obtaining samples and performing tests on Ms. Scampone to determine whether she had an infection. The former caretakers for Ms. Scam-pone testified to their observations that the limited personnel available could not accomplish all tasks required by Ms. Scampone’s care plan, and stated that they informed Highland Park and Grane Healthcare supervisors and administrators of the shortfall in care and its causes. The Scampone estate also introduced evidence regarding the relationship between Highland Park and Grane Healthcare; the degrees of direct healthcare provided to residents and of control exercised over daily operations at the nursing home by each appellant’s employees; and the decision-making process and authority invested in various employees and officers of Highland Park and Grane Healthcare, respectively, over budgetary and personnel matters.</p>

The Scampone estate’s nursing expert concluded that the failures to provide sufficient water and medication, to track the daily activities and report changes in condition, and to follow doctors’ directions breached the standard of care for a skilled nursing facility. Additionally, a medical expert testified that appel<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>lants’ breach of the standard of care, as described by the former employees and the nursing expert, caused dehydration and permitted Ms. Scampone’s urinary tract infection to progress, affecting her heart and leading up to her acute myocardial infarction and related death.</p>

Following briefing and argument, the trial court granted appellants’ motion, except for the request to dismiss appellee’s claim of corporate negligence against Highland Park. N.T., 5/25/2007, at 12-14. Highland Park, as the only defendant remaining in the case, proceeded to offer evidence in its defense.</p>
    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[146,1186,1153,628]]]'>Highland Park elicited testimony from its current and former employees regarding the daily care afforded Ms. Scam-pone and their observations regarding the level of staffing at the nursing home. According to the testimony, Highland Park had sufficient staff to meet state and federal requirements, as well as patient needs. Moreover, Highland Park offered evidence that, although record keeping was admittedly poor, Ms. Scampone received the requisite care. Highland Park sought to show that complaints of former employees regarding understaffing were unfounded or based on the perception and unjustified expectations of those witnesses, rather than on the actual requirements of appropriate care.</p>
    <p id="b445-6" data-blocks='[["BL_445.6",445,[146,1837,1151,519]],["BL_446.1",446,[272,314,1147,415]]]'>Highland Park also offered expert opinion on whether the care provided to Ms. Scampone met the standard for a skilled nursing facility; the expert testified that Ms. Scampone’s overall well-being and longevity exceeded expected outcomes given her age and degraded health upon admission, and was evidence that Highland Park met the requisite standard of care. Finally, Highland Park concluded with testimony from its medical expert, which challenged appellee’s theory of causation. The medical expert offered his opinion that Ms. Scampone’s decline, inability and/or unwillingness to take in <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>food and water, and Ms. Scampone’s subsequent death were caused by a stroke detected after her admission into the hospital. The expert described a rapid “cascading” effect, commonly encountered in geriatric patients like Ms. Scam-pone, whose cause could not be attributed to any acts or omissions of Highland Park or its employees. The trial court denied the Scampone estate’s request to offer rebuttal testimony.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[271,751,1150,629]]]'>On May 31, 2007, the trial court charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>with respect to the Scampone estate’s theories of direct and vicarious liability. N.T., 5/31/2007, at 161-67. The court then recessed for jury deliberations. On June 1, 2007, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Scampone estate, finding Highland Park directly and vicariously hable for negligence. The jury awarded appellee compensatory damages in the amount of $193,500. The parties filed cross-motions for post-verdict relief, which the trial court denied in October 2007. On November 8, 2007, the trial court entered a judgment on the verdict plus costs, which both parties appealed timely to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[273,1403,1150,952]]]'>The trial court ordered both parties to file statements of matters complained of on appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). The parties complied. In its Rule 1925(b) statement, the Scam-pone estate alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that its evidence was sufficient to state claims of direct and vicarious liability against Grane Healthcare, and for punitive damages against both Grane Healthcare and Highland Park; appellee challenged the trial court’s decision to grant appellants’ nonsuit motion in these respects. Highland Park, in its separate Rule 1925(b) statement, challenged the judgment on the ground that the trial court erred in allowing the Scampone estate’s corporate negligence claim against Highland Park to proceed to the jury. Among other theories, Highland Park argued that a nursing home, unlike a hospital or a health maintenance organization (“HMO”), is not exposed to direct liability under the corporate negligence theory recognized by Pennsylvania courts. On February 8, 2008, the trial court filed its Rule 1925(a) opinion, explaining the bases of its various decisions.</p>

      <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>On appeal, the Superior Court panel affirmed in part, holding that the trial court properly allowed the claim of corporate liability as to Highland Park to go to the jury. But, the panel otherwise reversed, based on the conclusion that the trial court improperly granted appellants’ motion for nonsuit because the Scampone estate had offered sufficient evidence with respect to corporate negligence (as to Grane Healthcare) and with respect to punitive damages (as to both appellants) to warrant submission of these issues to the jury. The panel remanded the matter to the trial court for a new trial, and dismissed as moot any remaining issues of which the parties complained on appeal. <em>See Scampone v.

According to appellants, this Court has limited corporate liability for negligent conduct to <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>hospitals, on the principle that the “corporate hospital today” is “a comprehensive health center with responsibility for arranging and coordinating the total healthcare of its patients.” Appellants’ Brief at 17 (quoting <em>Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/527/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="591 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="1827759" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0330-01">591 A.2d at 706</a>).

Appellants identify several “policy” reasons in support of their argument. First, according to appellants, developing a test for identifying healthcare corporations to which the doctrine should apply is impossible and unworkable; an added difficulty is to re-define hospitals’ duties under <em>Thompson </em>in a manner that applies to all healthcare corporations. Limiting the doctrine of corporate liability to hospitals, appellants claim, has the advantage of simplicity. Second, appellants posit that a cause of action for corporate negligence is superfluous, because patients can be made whole via vicarious liability claims. Third, appellants argue that the extension of liability will increase operational expenses, discouraging healthcare corporations from providing affordable, or even any, services in the Commonwealth. Such corporations, according to appellants, will be exposed to additional <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>liability, including for punitive damages; will be forced to obtain medical malpractice insurance, where now they rely on medical professionals to carry policies; and will generally suffer increased uncertainties and complexities in litigation, and decreased incentives for settlement.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[148,597,1154,1282]]]'>With respect to the development of a test for determining what types of healthcare corporations may be held liable for corporate negligence, appellants structure their argument on the assumption that some types of healthcare corporations are exempt from liability. Thus, appellants state that, after <em>Thompson, </em>the first extension of the doctrine was to an HMO, which was like a hospital because the HMO “actually provided health care to its subscribers.” Appellants’ Brief at 23 (citing <em>Shannon v. McNulty, </em><a href="/a2d/718/0828-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="718 A.2d 828" data-case-ids="11688384" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0828-01">718 A.2d 828</a> (Pa.Super.1998) (HMO may be held liable for corporate negligence)). Appellants distinguish <em>Shannon, </em>contending that the Superior Court’s considerations are inapplicable to a skilled nursing facility. Appellants represent that nursing home staffs simply carry out orders of physicians without the ability to challenge them, and skilled nursing facilities like Highland Park do not employ physicians and do not have an administrative staff to which to report failures of physicians. Accordingly, appellants state, holding a skilled nursing facility liable for acts or omissions which commonly occur in a hospital but not in the nursing facility is inappropriate.

Appellants note that other courts have proceeded even farther afield from this Court’s <em>Thompson </em>test and have looked to whether a patient “forfeit[s] legally or practically the ability to turn elsewhere for medical care,” whether a patient had to commit to a single provider for comprehensive care, or whether the provider delivered care or simply functioned as a gateway for entry into the healthcare system via referrals. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.

For further elucidation, appellee draws the following distinction: “although a nursing home would be vicariously liable for the negligent conduct of its nurse employees committed within the scope of employment ... when nurses fail to act in circumstances entirely beyond their control, and that failure results in harm to a patient, the proper cause of action may fall under the doctrine of corporate negligence.” Appellee’s Brief at 54 (emphasis omitted).

The court noted that appellate courts had yet to apply the <em>Thompson/Shannon </em>construct to a nursing home, but emphasized that no decision had exempted nursing homes from its application either. The court concluded that it “discern[ed] no reasoning within the <em>Thompson </em>or <em>Shannon </em>decisions to treat a nursing home, such as Highland Park Care Center, any differently than a hospital or an HMO with respect to corporate negligence liability.” According to the court, the central role played by the healthcare entity in the total care of its patients was the key factor in whether a corporate negligence claim was viable against the entity. Where the entity injected itself in the medical decisions affecting the patient’s care, it had an obligation to do so in a <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>medically reasonable manner. Tr. Ct. Op., 2/8/2008, at 9-10. The trial court grounded its decision in the evidence adduced by the Scampone estate at trial. According to the court, the estate had properly proven its theory of corporate liability with evidence that the staffing decisions of Highland Park directly and detrimentally affected Ms. Scampone’s care and ultimately caused her decline and death; such allegations were materially akin to those that might be asserted pursuant to <em>Thompson </em>or <em>Shannon </em>against a hospital or HMO, respectively. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

After resolving preliminary questions, the panel addressed Highland Park’s contention that a nursing home does not function as a hospital and, therefore, is not liable as a matter of law for “corporate negligence.” The panel subscribed to the view that this Court first adopted “corporate negligence” as a basis for liability against a hospital in <em>Thompson, </em>and that the Superior Court later “extended” the theory of liability in <em>Shannon </em>and <em>Hyrcza </em>to HMOs and medical professional corporations, respectively. According to the panel, “a nursing home is analogous to a hospital in the level of its involvement in a patient’s overall health care” and, therefore, Highland Park’s contention that it did not function as a hospital had to be rejected. <em>Scampone, </em><a href="/pa/608/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="11 A.3d 967" data-case-ids="4199629,7288685,7288777" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0396-01,/a3d/11/0967-01,/a3d/11/0967-02">11 A.3d at </a>976 (citing <em>Shannon, <a href="/a2d/718/0828-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="718 A.2d 828" data-case-ids="11688384" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0828-01">supra,</a> </em>and <em>Hyrcza v.

Appellants suggest that we should not recognize corporate direct liability because claims under such a theory are substantially similar to vicarious liability claims against corporations, and permitting only vicarious liability claims against the corporate entity promotes simplicity and fairness, as appellants perceive it. According to appellants, juries will likely be confused by the assertion of both direct and vicarious claims against a corporation, leading to double recoveries. We disagree. The direct and vicarious theories of liability are grounded in distinct policies and serve complementary purposes in the law of torts, with the goal of fully compensating a victim of negligence in an appropriate case. The distinctions between direct and vicarious negligence theories are no more or less confusing than other legal concepts, and it is incumbent upon the parties, through their attorneys, to aid courts in narrowing issues and formulating appropriate instructions to guide juries in their factual determinations and to avoid the possibility of double recoveries. Bright lines and broad rules always offer a superficially enticing option. However, we cannot elevate the <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>lull of simplicity over the balancing of interests embodied by the principles underpinning our negligence jurisprudence. <em>See Flagiello, </em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="208 A.2d 193">208 A.2d at 201</a> (liability for negligence assures compensation for injury and “gives warning that justice and the law demand the exercise of care”).

Appellants’ central presumption is that direct liability does not attach to a particular defendant until this Court recognizes access to the cause of action against the relevant type of entity, here, the corporate nursing home and/or affiliated corporate entities. According to appellants, the jurisprudential role of the <em>Flagiello </em>decision was to create a clean slate upon which the Court built by creating new causes of action to be asserted only against hospitals, in recognition of hospitals’ importance and market status. Appellants argue against what they see as “expanding” the exposure for direct liability to nursing homes and related entities, by referring to policy-driven considerations, such as the alternative availability of compensation for an injured plaintiff, allegations of an exponential increase in operational and litigation costs for the nursing home industry, and the ostensible difficulties in creating any test by which to apply what they say is this “new” form of liability to nursing homes and affiliated entities.</p>

Immunity or exemption from liability is the exception to the general rule that an entity must meet the obligations it incurs in functioning. <em>Flagiello, supra. </em>Negligence liability, based on direct and vicarious theories, is a long-tenured cause of action at common law, and it serves to make whole a plaintiff for the injury caused by a defendant’s breach of a legal duty to the plaintiff. Like any other cause of action at common law, negligence evolves <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>through either directly applicable decisional law or by analogy, meaning that a defendant is not categorically exempt from liability simply because appellate decisional law has not specifically addressed a theory of liability in a particular context. Categorical exemptions from liability exist (following the dismantling by this Court of judicial immunities in the 1960s and 1970s) only where the General Assembly has acted to create explicit policy-based immunities, <em>e.g., </em>to protect the public purse. Where either no immunity exists, or the legislative branch created exceptions to an immunity legislatively conferred, the default general rule of possible liability operates. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8522(a), 8542(a); <em>Mascaro v.

We do not doubt that the industry operates upon a thin margin; nevertheless, the question of tort insulation requires an assessment and balancing of policies best left to the General Assembly. From the judicial perspective, the duty at law is independent of the financial status of a defendant.

The <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>Court went on to explain this duty by listing aspects of a hospital’s responsibilities within four general categories. Notably, the <em>Thompson </em>majority did not purport to treat hospitals as <em>sui generis </em>corporate entities or to limit its decision to hospitals. To be sure, Justice Flaherty’s dissent warned of what the dissent viewed as the dangerous consequences of a broad reading of the majority opinion which would recognize the same theory with respect to non-hospital entities. But, the dissent’s warning merely posed the question; the dissent’s view did not operate to narrow the theory; the majority did not engage that question (which was not before the Court); and the question of the logical parameters of the theory was left to legislative or case development. As it has happened, the subsequent decisional law in the lower courts, for the most part, has not taken up the banner of the dissent and has relied upon the reasoning in <em>Thompson </em>to support the proposition that medical corporations other than hospitals may owe duties directly to their patients.</p>

But, appellants’ application of the principle, much as their application of <em>Thompson, </em>is exceedingly literal, failing to’ account for the prudential considerations governing it, for how the principle dovetails with the concept of precedent at common law, or for how a recognition of corporate liability in other contexts itself squares with tort theory.</p>

While these distinctions may be relevant evidence to the trial court’s ultimate determination of whether a duty exists, they do not fully anticipate the proper question that the trial court was required to decide in the first instance.
