Commonwealth parties’ liabilities in suits subject to the Sovereign Immunity Act are limited to $250,000 as a matter of constitutional and statutory law. The contractual limitation on damages here stands on different footing, however, and damages are not absolutely limited to those that the parties have agreed to in the insurance contract. Rule 238 in effect levies delay damages as a matter of law in order to achieve what this Court, in executing its right and duty to promulgate procedural rules, has determined to be an appropriate rule to manage the dockets of civil courts and to encourage settlements. <em>See Laudenberger, <a href="/pa/496/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="496 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1772909" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0052-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/496/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="496 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1772909" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0052-01">at 152</a>.</p>

In so doing, the Majority erodes the authority of this Court to promulgate procedural rules. Indeed, the Majority’s holding calls into question the holding of <em>Lauden</em>

      <em>berger, supra, </em>that Rule 238 does not improperly expand any substantive right, but, rather, permissibly fosters the procedural goal of encouraging prompt settlements in appropriate cases. If, as we concluded in <em>Laudenberger, </em>Rule 238’s imposition of delay damages is a proper exercise of our rulemaking authority in the pursuit of fostering settlements, then, consistent with <em>Allen, </em>I perceive no reason not to award delay damages based on the jury verdict when calculating delay damages against a private party. It seems to me that the Majority’s position effectively concedes as much, since even the Majority Opinion awards delay damages on top of the policy limits. If that much is proper, it confounds me why we should not interpret Rule 238 consistent with its salutary purpose. The jury here awarded $550,000, and I believe that delay damages, pursuant to Rule 238, should have been calculated on that amount. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
