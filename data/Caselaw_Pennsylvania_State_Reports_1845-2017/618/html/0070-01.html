As argued by the Commonwealth, there is no question that the prosecutor was responding to defense counsel’s strenuous verbal attack on the credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses, several of whom were self-acknowledged drug dealers who had been convicted of numerous offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The prosecutor was emphasizing to the jurors that <em>their </em>determinations as to credibility were controlling, and he was urging the jurors not to dismiss the witnesses’ testimony merely on the basis of the witnesses’ prior illegal conduct. This is entirely proper and consistent with prevailing law. We recognize that the prosecutor’s use of the colloquial expression “shoot the messenger” was not a complete or particularly articulate way to convey these messages. Furthermore, the prosecutor’s comparison between defense counsel “shooting the messenger” and Appellant killing a witness was inappropriate, irrelevant, and beyond the bounds of proper prosecutorial advocacy. Nonetheless, we discern no possibility that the prosecutor’s brief albeit unsavory comparison, which was directed at defense counsel, not Appellant, could have prejudiced the jury toward Appellant such that the jurors were unable to weigh the evidence objectively and render a fair verdict.</p>
