In December 2008, Employer announced a reduction in force due to financial conditions and issued a memo to Employee’s union, UAW Local 1968, with a list of twenty employees who would be laid-off in accordance with the Reduction in Workforce section of the contract with the union. While the list did not include Employee, who had high seniority, the memo explained that up to ten listed employees would be “retained to fill vacancies pending the results of the Early Retirement offer.” Employer Memo to Union, December 19, 2008, at 2. As found by an Unemployment Compensation Referee, Employer offered employees over sixty years old an early retirement program to encourage high seniority employees to leave so that the less senior employees on the list would not be laid off. Referee Decision/Order of June 23, 2009. The terms of the offer included full payment of health insurance for three years and <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>partial payment of insurance for two years. Additionally, Employer would pay for unused vacation days, but not a severance benefit or other monetary compensation.

Employer did not attend the hearing but submitted a letter limited to the following statements: “The retirement packages offered to all hourly employees this year have been part of an overall reduction in force. The reductions in force have been necessary in response to deteriorating business conditions.” ESAB Letter dated June 16, 2009. Subsequently, the referee affirmed the <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>denial of benefits, citing the following language from Section 402(b): “An employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week ...

Upon Employee’s motion, the UCBR granted reconsideration and vacated its prior determination to address Employee’s legal issue regarding the VLO Proviso of Section 402(b).

The court did not attempt to distinguish the facts of <em>W.R. Grace </em>or recognize that the employee in <em>W.R.

The claimant in <em>George </em>accepted the offer, fearing his job would be one of those cut. Primarily, the claimant argued that he satisfied the “necessitous or compelling cause” portion of Section 402(b), which the court rejected based on facts found by the lower tribunals. Nevertheless, it appears that the claimant at least referenced the VLO Proviso in his argument. In a footnote addressing this secondary VLO Proviso argument, Commonwealth Court, citing <em>Flannery, </em>opined that the VLO Proviso “does not apply to situations involving acceptance of severance or retirement incentives,” again without any analysis of the language of the VLO Proviso. <em><a href="/a2d/767/1124-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="767 A.2d 1124" data-case-ids="11127506" data-case-paths="/a2d/767/1124-01">Id.</a> </em>at 1128 n. 10.</p>

As acknowledged in the name given to the provision, the “voluntary” layoff option forbids the denial of UC benefits merely because an employee has accepted, voluntarily, a plan offered by the employer.

As such, and in line with the majority’s suggestion, I believe that this case should be remanded for further findings as to whether Appellant is otherwise eligible for benefits. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 600 n. 5, 57 A.3d at 1213 n. 5.</p>

    <p id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.5",692,[273,1454,1148,777]]]'>I agree the term layoff means “termination of employment at the will of the employer.” Majority Op., at 604-06, 607-10, 57 A.3d at 1216-17, 1218-19. I do not believe, however, that interpreting eligibility sections liberally makes “layoff’ so broad as to include retirement. Retirement, which is not defined in the UC Law, in its common usage means “[vjoluntary termination of one’s own employment or career, esp. upon reaching a certain age[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 1342 (8th ed.2004). For all the parsing and shoehorning of language, these two terms remain quite disparate. “Liberal interpretation” of eligibility is not alchemy, and cannot turn a voluntary retirement into an involuntary layoff. One term encompasses termination at the will of the employer, and one encompasses termination at the will of the employee-unemployment compensation is intended for the former, not the latter.</p>

The two strategies, although related, are distinct and separate from each other. In fact, Employee accepted a retirement package, not a layoff. There is no evidence his position would have been cut — in fact, the evidence shows he was <em>not </em>forced to accept the retirement package. Whatever his altruistic motivations, unemployment compensation is designed for those who lose their job, not those who voluntarily leave their job.</p>

Given the practical and legal consequences of the differences between the two terms, I believe the VLO Proviso should be applied only to employees that are laid off, and not to those who freely accept a retirement package.</p>
