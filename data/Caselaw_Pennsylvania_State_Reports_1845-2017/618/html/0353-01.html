In terms of the stay matter, the court initially questioned whether it had jurisdiction as no motion was directly before it and in light of Section 9545(c) of the Post Conviction Relief Act. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To the degree that jurisdiction was present, the court reasoned:</p>
    <blockquote id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[315,1075,1107,466]]]'>A stay is an extraordinary remedy. It is more so when the remedy is sought to be exercised outside of established methods. In the present case, to the extent any stay was requested at all in this Court, the only reasons advanced were to gain more time to prepare for a clemency hearing. There was no substantial showing that even if the proffered expert findings came back in [Applicant’s] favor, there would be a substantial likelihood of gaining clemency or otherwise avoiding execution.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[316,1556,1109,685]]]'>Indeed, our examination of the clemency petition filed by [Applicant] which was provided to us by the Board of Pardons, reveals little by way of reasons why clemency should be granted or execution stayed. For the most part, [Applicant] deferred to his lawyers. One substantive statement he made amounted to not being the person he was in 1993. There is no claim of innocence, to the contrary, he offers no reason why he committed the murder. We conclude that the state’s interest in finality of the proceedings and, ultimately, the carrying out of a lawfully imposed sentence outweighs any of those reasons advanced by [Applicant] to step in at this late date and put a halt to those proceedings.</blockquote>
