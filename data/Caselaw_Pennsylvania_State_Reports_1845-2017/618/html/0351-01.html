    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[273,387,1151,849]]]'>Appellants filed this action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commonwealth’s Office of Open Records and its executive director to prevent the release of information in response to a request pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law. The information requested included the home addresses of, <em>inter alia, </em>the named individual appellants. Contemporaneous with their petition for review, appellants also sought a preliminary injunction. On July 28, 2009, the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman issued a single judge order granting appellants’ application for a preliminary injunction. Appellees appealed the grant of a preliminary injunction. On August 17, 2010, this Court affirmed Judge Friedman’s order in a <em>per curiam </em>decision, without prejudice to any party’s right to appeal the Commonwealth Court’s final disposition. <em>Pa. State Educ. Ass’n v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/606/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="606 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="4198647" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0638-01">606 Pa. 638</a>, <a href="/pa/606/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.3d 558" data-case-ids="4198647,7288292" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0638-01,/a3d/2/0558-01">2 A.3d 558</a> (2010).</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[275,1270,1150,419]]]'>Subsequently, on September 24, 2010, the Commonwealth Court issued an <em>en banc </em>decision sustaining appellees’ preliminary objections and dismissing appellants’ petition for review. On October 13, 2010, the Commonwealth Court denied appellants’ application for restoration of an injunction pending appeal. Appellants filed a timely appeal from the Commonwealth Court’s <em>en banc </em>decision, and that appeal remains pending in this Court. <em>See </em>No. 59 MAP 2010.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[276,1720,1150,634]]]'>On October 19, 2010, appellants filed the present applications seeking to restore the <em>status quo </em>pre-dating the Commonwealth Court’s <em>en banc </em>decision, via reinstatement of the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Friedman. Albeit the request for relief is characterized as a restoration of the preliminary injunction, on the merits, the parties essentially argue whether an entry of a stay pending appeal is appropriate. Upon review of the parties’ pleadings, we believe that appellants are entitled to a stay pursuant to <em>Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm’n v. Process Gas Consumers Group, </em><a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">502 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">467 A.2d 805</a> (1983).
