        "text": "PER CURIAM.\nAppellants filed this action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commonwealth\u2019s Office of Open Records and its executive director to prevent the release of information in response to a request pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law. The information requested included the home addresses of, inter alia, the named individual appellants. Contemporaneous with their petition for review, appellants also sought a preliminary injunction. On July 28, 2009, the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman issued a single judge order granting appellants\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction. Appellees appealed the grant of a preliminary injunction. On August 17, 2010, this Court affirmed Judge Friedman\u2019s order in a per curiam decision, without prejudice to any party\u2019s right to appeal the Commonwealth Court\u2019s final disposition. Pa. State Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Commonwealth, 606 Pa. 638, 2 A.3d 558 (2010).\nSubsequently, on September 24, 2010, the Commonwealth Court issued an en banc decision sustaining appellees\u2019 preliminary objections and dismissing appellants\u2019 petition for review. On October 13, 2010, the Commonwealth Court denied appellants\u2019 application for restoration of an injunction pending appeal. Appellants filed a timely appeal from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s en banc decision, and that appeal remains pending in this Court. See No. 59 MAP 2010.\nOn October 19, 2010, appellants filed the present applications seeking to restore the status quo pre-dating the Commonwealth Court\u2019s en banc decision, via reinstatement of the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Friedman. Albeit the request for relief is characterized as a restoration of the preliminary injunction, on the merits, the parties essentially argue whether an entry of a stay pending appeal is appropriate. Upon review of the parties\u2019 pleadings, we believe that appellants are entitled to a stay pursuant to Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm\u2019n v. Process Gas Consumers Group, 502 Pa. 545, 467 A.2d 805 (1983). Accordingly, we enter the following:\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 1st day of November 2010, upon consideration of appellants\u2019 Application for Restoration of Injunction Pending Appeal and Application for Expedited Consideration of Application for Restoration of Injunction Pending Appeal, the order of the Commonwealth Court dated September 24, 2010, is STAYED pending disposition of the appellants\u2019 appeal to this Court at No. 59 MAP 2010. This Court\u2019s Order of August 17, 2010, affirming the entry of the preliminary injunction on July 28, 2009, shall remain in effect.",
