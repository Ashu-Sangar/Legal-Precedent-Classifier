        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nThis is a direct appeal from a Commonwealth Court order setting aside the nomination petition of Andrew Gales (\u201cCandidate\u201d) as a Democratic Candidate for Pennsylvania State Representative in the 57th Legislative District. On April 4, 2012, this Court reversed the order of the Commonwealth Court, directed that Candidate\u2019s name be printed on the April 24, 2012 primary election ballot, and indicated that an opinion would follow. This opinion provides the rationale for the Court\u2019s previous order, and holds that the Election Code does not prohibit an elector from signing a nomination petition using an obvious diminutive form of his or her first name, rather than the formal first name that appears on the elector\u2019s voter registration card.\nOn February 16, 2012, Candidate filed a nomination petition seeking to be listed on the Democratic ballot in the primary election for Pennsylvania State Representative in the 57th Legislative District. Under the Election Code, the nomination petition of a candidate for such office must contain 300 valid signatures of registered and enrolled members of the Democratic Party from that legislative district. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2872.1(14). Candidate\u2019s nomination petition contained 395 signatures.\nOn February 23, 2012, James R. Barbre and Robert E. Cole (\u201cObjectors\u201d) filed a petition to set aside Candidate\u2019s nomination petition (\u201cpetition to set aside\u201d), alleging, inter alia, that 119 of the 395 signatures were invalid. The parties thereafter submitted a joint stipulation that 74 of the 395 signatures were invalid, reducing the number of signatures in the nomination petition to 321.\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing on March 6-7, 2012, the Commonwealth Court struck a total of 23 signatures, reducing the number of valid signatures to 298, two less than required under the Election Code. Significantly, the court struck ten of the signatures on the ground that the electors, while eligible and registered Democratic voters from that legislative district, signed the common diminutive version of their first name, instead of signing the full first name that appeared on their voter registration card. See Notes of Testimony, Mar. 6, 2012, at 11-22. In support of its ruling in this regard, the Commonwealth Court cited its prior decision in Piccirilli v. Lee, 944 A.2d 840, 842 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008), which held that signatures using a \u201cnickname,\u201d diminutive or otherwise, instead of a given first name should be stricken from a nomination petition absent evidence confirming the identity of the elector.\nThe following chart identifies the signatures struck on this basis.\nPage Line First Name First Name Last Name (Diminutive) (As Listed on Voter Registration Card)\n1 6 Ed Edward Christopher\n1 15 Cindy Cynthia Finch\n5 11 Ray Raymond Bell\n5 22 Don Donald Williams\n5 34 Jim James Ferrett\n7 19 Tom Thomas Hart\n8 4 Ray Raymond McGill\n24 21 Larry Lawrence Pelerose\n16 6 Debbie Debra Kosnosky\n24 9 Jen Jennifer Lewis\nThe Commonwealth Court struck 13 other signatures for various reasons, including that women signed the nomination petition with their married names although they had registered to vote under their maiden names; that the date listed with the signature was out of sequence with the dates of other signatures on the nomination petition; and that signatures were either illegible, listed an incorrect address, or were signed in handwriting that did not match the signature on the voter registration card. Concluding that Candidate had two less signatures than required, the Commonwealth Court set aside his nomination petition and directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth not to certify Candidate in the primary election for state representative.\nIn reviewing the order of the Commonwealth Court concerning the validity of challenges to Candidate\u2019s nomination petition, our standard of review is \u201cwhether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, whether there was an abuse of discretion, or whether errors of law were committed.\u201d In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001). A party alleging defects in a nominating petition has the burden of proving such defects, and, where the court is not convinced that challenged signatures are other than genuine, the challenge is to be resolved in favor of the candidate. Id. Further, the Election Code should be liberally construed to protect a candidate\u2019s right to run for office and the voters\u2019 rights to elect the candidate of their choice. In re Nomination Petition of Wesley, 536 Pa. 609, 640 A.2d 1247, 1249 (1994).\nCandidate contends that the Commonwealth Court erred by striking signatures on the ground that the electors signed the common shortened form of their first names, rather than the formal first names that appear on their voter registration cards. He submits that Section 908 of the Election Code, which delineates the manner of signing nomination petitions, does not require the elector to sign his or her formal first name, but rather directs only that all electors sign their name to a candidate\u2019s nomination petition.\nCandidate emphasizes that all of the signatures struck on this basis were obvious diminutive forms of the formal first names, such as Ed for Edward and Ray for Raymond, as set forth supra. Thus, he maintains, the use of the diminutive form of the electors\u2019 first name presents no danger of fraud, particularly where Objectors have not contended that the electors were in any way ineligible to sign his nomination petition. Candidate relies on the aforementioned principles that the Election Code should be liberally construed to protect a candidate\u2019s right to run for office and the voters\u2019 right to choose their candidate, and that any doubts as to the validity of a challenge must be resolved in favor of the candidate.\nRegretfully, Candidate does not analyze the case law relied upon by the Commonwealth Court, which we discuss in detail infra, addressing discrepancies between an elector\u2019s signature on a nomination petition and the name appearing on the elector\u2019s voter registration card. Rather, Appellant cites two unpublished Commonwealth Court decisions in which that court purportedly rejected challenges based upon the use of diminutive forms of the electors\u2019 formal first names. See Brief of Appellant at 8-9 (citing In re Nomination Petition of Altmire, 114 M.D.2012; In re Nomination Petition of Gearing, 128 M.D.2012). He also relies on cases unrelated to the Election Code, holding that a prohibition on the use of a common diminutive first name would \u201coffend reason\u201d in the context of perfecting a judgment lien. Id. \u00b6 at 11 (citing Burns v. Ross, 215 Pa. 293, 64 A. 526 (1906); Coral Gables, Inc. v. Kerl, 334 Pa. 441, 6 A.2d 275 (1939)). Candidate argues that the same analysis should be extended to cases arising under the Election Code.\nIn response, Objectors categorize a diminutive form of a formal first name as a nickname, and posit that this case is governed by well-established Commonwealth Court case law holding that signatures reflecting the electors\u2019 nicknames are invalid because they differ from the name appearing on the electors\u2019 voter registration card. See Brief for Appellee at 3 (citing inter alia, In re: Nomination Petition of Sheila Dow Ford, 994 A.2d 9, 24 n. 13 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010)) (striking as invalid a signature on a nomination petition that is signed by an elector using a nickname, instead of his or her full name as it appears on the elector\u2019s voter registration card); In re Nomination Petition of Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, 822 A.2d 859, 861 n. 3 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) (noting that a signature using a nickname was invalid as it did not match the elector\u2019s first name listed on the voter registration card); In re Petition for Agenda Initiative, 821 A.2d 203, 211 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) (striking as invalid voters\u2019 signatures on an agenda initiative petition using nicknames which were not shown to be the actual signatures of the voters); In re: Nomination Petition of Charles Cooper, 163 Pa.Cmwlth. 430, 643 A.2d 717, 726 (1994) (striking as invalid electors\u2019 signatures on a nomination petition that reflected a \u201cnickname,\u201d such as Mike instead of Michael, instead of the proper name listed on the voter registration affidavit where there was no evidence confirming the identity of the elector).\nIn determining whether the Commonwealth Court erred in striking signatures reflecting an obvious diminutive form of the electors\u2019 first name, we begin, as we should, with a review of the governing statutory provision. Section 908 of the Election Code provides, in relevant part, as follows:\nEach signer of a nomination petition shall sign but one such petition for each office to be filled, and shall declare therein that he is a registered and enrolled member of the party designated in such petition____He shall also declare therein that he is a qualified elector of the county therein named.... He shall add his residence, giving city, borough or township, with street and number, if any, and shall legibly print his name and add the date of signing, expressed in words or numbers____\n25 P.S. \u00a7 2868. In interpreting a statute, a court\u2019s goal is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). The statute\u2019s plain language is the best indication of that intent. When the statute\u2019s words are clear and free from all ambiguity, its letter is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. Id. \u00b6 \u00a7 1921(b).\nUpon examining the plain language of Section 908, we agree with Candidate that this provision does not require that an elector sign his formal first name on a nomination petition nor does it preclude the use of an obvious diminutive version of the elector\u2019s first name. Admittedly, the language directing an elector to \u201csign\u201d and print his \u201cname\u201d is ambiguous, as it does not delineate expressly what form of an elector\u2019s name is acceptable. When the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly can be ascertained by considering the occasion and necessity for the statute. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(1). Our Court has recognized that the signature requirement serves as \u201ca means of preventing forgery and assuring that each elector personally signs the petition with an understanding of what he is signing.\u201d Flaherty, 770 A.2d at 332. Thus, we must factor into our consideration whether an elector\u2019s use of an obvious diminutive form of his first name conflicts with this underlying purpose of Section 908.\nWe find that it does not. Our decision is based on the fact that the ten names challenged herein are obvious shortened versions of the electors\u2019 first names, which do not call into question the identity of the signatory or compromise the integrity of the election process. Any individual examining the face of the nomination petition and comparing the challenged signatures to the voter registration cards of the electors would have no difficulty determining the identity of the signatory. For example, when elector Edward Christopher signed Candidate\u2019s nomination petition as Ed Christopher, no great deductive power was required to determine the signatory. The same can be said for each of the remaining diminutive first names set forth at page 3, supra, such as Jen for Jennifer and Debbie for Debra. Further, the parties agree that the ten electors whose signatures are challenged were qualified, registered voters who were eligible to sign Candidate\u2019s nomination petition.\nAccordingly, because the language of Section 908 does not affirmatively preclude the use of an elector\u2019s diminutive first name, the use of an obvious diminutive first name does not compromise the integrity of the election process, and because the Election Code is to be liberally construed in favor of the candidate, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred by striking the signatures reflecting the electors\u2019 obvious diminutive first names.\nWe reaffirm the principle that in cases unlike the instant case, where it is not obvious that the signature on the nomination petition reflects the same name that appears on the elector\u2019s voter registration card, absent other evidence, the signature should be stricken. For example, if one\u2019s formal name is \u201cBeatrice\u201d and the nomination petition is signed \u201cSkippy,\u201d then that signature is invalid and should be struck.\nIn so holding, we acknowledge readily the Commonwealth Court case law that has held to the contrary. In the case of In re Nomination of Charles Cooper, supra, the objectors to a nomination petition challenged signatures using \u201cnicknames,\u201d such as Mike for Michael, or Terry for Terrance. 643 A.2d at 726. The court held that where the elector signs a nickname on the nomination petition instead of his or her proper name as set forth on the voter registration affidavit, the signature must be stricken. Recognizing that certain cases may be obvious, such as Mike for Michael, the court nevertheless treated all shortened forms of a first name as a \u201cnickname,\u201d and held that \u201c[i]n order to be fair and to draw a clear line, without amendment, such a defect requires the signature to be stricken.\u201d Id. at 726-27.\nInterestingly, the Commonwealth Court in Cooper distinguished an elector\u2019s use of a \u201cnickname\u201d from other circumstances where the signature of an elector on a nomination petition is acceptable, even though it does not match identically the signature of the elector on the voter registration affidavit. Specifically, the court held that it was not required to strike signatures where the elector omits his or her middle initial, a marital prefix, or suffix, such as \u201cJr.\u201d or \u201cSr.\u201d Under those circumstances, the court reasoned, the elector\u2019s signature admittedly contains a defect, but that such defect is so insignificant as to not be a material error. Id. at 726. It concluded that absent an allegation of fraud, or other basis to cast serious doubt as to the genuineness of the signature, a signature with an immaterial error would not be struck. The Commonwealth Court found that it would be totally unreasonable to require electors to remember whether they used a middle initial when they completed the voter\u2019s affidavit, in some instances, twenty or thirty years before. Id.\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s reasoning in Cooper served as the basis for its holding in subsequent cases involving challenges to signatures reflecting an elector\u2019s \u201cnickname.\u201d See e.g. In re: Nomination Petition of Sheila Dow Ford, 994 A.2d at 24 n. 13 (citing Cooper for the proposition that a signature line that is signed by an elector using a nickname instead of his or her full name as it appears on the elector\u2019s voter registration card must be stricken from the nomination petition); Piccirilli v. Lee, 944 A.2d at 842 (citing Cooper for proposition that absent evidence confirming the identity of the elector, signatures reflecting a nickname must be stricken); In re Fitzpatrick, 822 A.2d at 861 n. 3 (same); In re Petition for Agenda Initiative, 821 A.2d at 211 (same).\nTo the extent our holding conflicts with Cooper and its progeny relating to commonly accepted shortened versions of an elector\u2019s first name, we hereby reject Cooper\u2019s analysis. We find that the obvious diminutive forms of first names at issue here are more akin to an elector\u2019s omission of either a middle initial or a designation as \u201cJr.\u201d or \u201cSr.,\u201d which have both been found to be immaterial defects that do not invalidate the signature. We emphasize that in all challenges to nomination petitions, each signature will have to be examined independently to determine whether, in fact, the diminutive form of the name appearing on the nomination petition is an obvious substitute for the formal name. Such case-by-case determinations are not novel to election cases, in which courts routinely examine each challenged signature individually.\nFinally, we reconcile our holding herein with our previous holding in Flaherty, supra, where we ruled that the Commonwealth Court erred by failing to strike signatures that did not reflect the name or address that appeared on the electors\u2019 voter registration card. In Flaherty, the objectors challenged signatures on the ground that the electors printed their name as opposed to signed their name on the nomination petition. This Court agreed. Citing the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in Cooper, we stated that \u201c[a]n elector\u2019s name will be stricken where the elector prints his name upon a candidate\u2019s nomination petition so that it does not match his signature on his voter registration card.\u201d Id. at 332. Notably, this holding in no way involved an elector\u2019s use of an obvious shortened version of his or her first name, but rather was grounded in the mandate of Section 908 of the Election Code, which required electors to \u201csign\u201d rather than print their name to a candidate\u2019s nomination petition. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2868. As noted, there is no corresponding provision of the Election Code that requires electors to sign their formal first name when a diminutive form of the same is obvious.\nThe objectors in Flaherty also challenged signatures on the basis that the addresses the electors listed on the nomination petition did not correspond with their registered addresses. This Court agreed with the objectors that such signatures should have been stricken because the Election Code contained stringent requirements regarding an elector\u2019s registration of his address, and an elector\u2019s notification to authorities of any change of address. Thus, our decision in Flaherty instructs that signatures that differ from the name on the elector\u2019s voter registration card in a material way that violates the Election Code should be stricken. We did not hold, however, that a signature is invalid if there is any difference between the elector\u2019s signature on a nomination petition and the name that appears on the elector\u2019s voter registration card. See Piccirilli, 944 A.2d at 842-43 (providing that this Court\u2019s decision in \u201cFlaherty does not mean that any and all defects in the signature would require that the signature be stricken\u2014 only substantial ones\u201d). Because the electors herein signed obvious shortened versions of their first names, the defects were immaterial and did not invalidate the signatures.\nIn conclusion, as Candidate was only two names short of acquiring the 800 signatures needed to appear on the ballot and, as ten signatures were struck on the basis of an obvious diminutive form of the name, the Commonwealth Court erred by setting aside his nomination petition and directing the Secretary of the Commonwealth not to certify Candidate in the primary election for state representative. It is for these reasons that this Court entered the order on April 4, 2012, reversing the order of the Commonwealth Court, and directing that Candidate\u2019s name be printed on the April 24, 2012 primary election ballot.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in this opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. We have exclusive jurisdiction in this case because it involves an appeal of a final order entered by the Commonwealth Court in a matter originally commenced in that court. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 723(a).\n. The Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (\"SURE\u201d) voter registration cards of challenged electors were entered into evidence, which established the given name of the electors.\n. Candidate also challenges the Commonwealth Court's striking of signatures listing the electors' married name although the electors had registered to vote in their maiden name, and the striking of a signature on the basis that the date listed was out of sequence with the dates of other signatures on the nomination petition. Further, Candidate argues that the petition to set aside should have been dismissed because the objectors failed personally to serve him with a copy of the petition (it was delivered by Federal Express). As we find that Candidate is entitled to relief based on his challenge to the striking of diminutive signatures, we need not address his further contentions.\n. The relevant portions of Section 908 of the Election Code are set forth on page 6, infra.\n. As discussed infra, this is not necessarily true, however, where the elector signs only the first letter of his or her first name, a nickname, or any other name that, absent other evidence, is not readily identifiable as being the same name that appears on the voter registration card.\n. We question the need for a \"clear line\u201d in this regard as the Commonwealth Court will be examining each challenged signature independently and can strike a non-obvious nickname, while accepting a different signature reflecting an obvious shortened form of the elector\u2019s first name.\n. This Court has not heretofore had the occasion to address the propriety of an elector signing his name on a nomination petition by using an obvious diminutive form of his first name, although we have addressed circumstances, as detailed infra, where the elector's signature on the nomination petition differed from the name as set forth on the elector\u2019s voter registration card.",
