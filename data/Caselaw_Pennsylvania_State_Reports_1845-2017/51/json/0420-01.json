    "head_matter": "Blight, Executor, &c., versus Blight, Executor, &c.\n1. The general rule is that apportionment is not to he made of rents, dividends, annuities or other periodical payments, becoming due at fixed intervals, but only of sums accruing de die in diem.\n2. Dower, and sums for the maintenance of a wife or child, are exceptions. An annuity in lieu of dower will last as long as dower would have lasted.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia. In that court it was an amicable action between George Blight, executor, &e., of Maria Blight, deceased, plaintiff, and James H. Blight, executor and trustee, $sc., of Greorge Blight, deceased, in which the following case was stated:\u2014\nGeorge Blight, the elder, by will, dated 31st day of August 1834, duly probated, and considered as part of this case, inter alia, bequeathed as follows:\u2014\n\u201c I give and bequeath to her, the said Maria Blight (the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix), the annuity or yearly sum of $6000, to be paid to her in even and equal quarterly payments, for and during all the term of her natural life.\n\u201c These bequests to my said dear wife are to be taken and considered to be in lieu and full satisfaction of all dower in my estate.\u201d >\nThe said George Blight died on the 1st day of September 1834, and the defendant is the surviving executor of his will. He entered on the performance of the trust, and paid to the said Maria Blight during her life, her said annuity as it fell due on the first days of December, March, June and September, in quarterly payments, as aforesaid. The last payment was made on 1st of December 1864. The said Maria Blight died on the 11th day of January 1865.\nIf the court be of opinion on the above facts that the law is with the plaintiff, and that the said annuity is apportionabl\u00e9, then judgment to be entered for plaintiff for $638.33 with costs; but if they are of opinion that the said annuity is not apportionabl\u00e9, and that the law is with the defendant, then judgment to be entered for defendant, with costs. Either party to take a writ of error.\n1865, July 15. \u2014 Judgment for plaintiff, no opinion being given.\nEd. Wain, for plaintiff in error.\nThe ease stated exhibits a clear ease of annuity, carefully specifying all the requisites of a technical legal annuity.\nIt is bequeathed as \u201c an annuityit is \u201c to be paid to her,\u201d not to her executor, \u201c in even and equal quarterly payments\u201d during her life. It does not, accrue de die in diem ; and it falls expressly within the law relating to annuities.\nMr. Swanston, in his note to Ex parte Smith, 1 Swanst. 348, states the principle : \u201cThe rule of law which refuses apportionment of rent in respect of time, is applicable to all periodical payments becoming due at fixed intervals, not to sums accruing de die in diem:\" Pearly v. Smith, 3 Atk. 261; Howell v. Hanforth, 2 W. Black. 1016; Rashleigh v. Master, 3 Brown\u2019s Ch. Cases 101; Wilson v. Hermon, 2 Ves. 672; Sherrard v. Sherrard, 3 Atk. 502; McKeen\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 485 (42 Penna. St. Rep.); 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 480 and notes, where all the authorities are collected.\nThe exceptions to the rule refusing apportionment are annuities, for maintenance of infants: Hay v. Palmer, 2 P. Wms. 501; Sheppard v. Wilson, 4 Hare 395; Rhenish v. Martin, quoted in note to 1 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 480.\nAnd of married women living separate from their husbands: Howell v. Hanforth, 2 W. Black. 1016; 1 Sch. & Lefroy 303; from the necessity of the case, as per Grey, C. J.\n\u201c And though rents and common annuities are not apportionable either by law or equity, yet in equity the maintenance of infants is always apportioned up to the day of their death, because it would be difficult for them to find credit for necessaries, if the payment depended on their living to the end of the quarter. This case (Howell v. Hanforth) depends on similar principles, the annuity being for a separate maintenance to a feme covert.\u201d\nPer Mr. Justice Strong, in McKeen\u2019s Appeal, 41 Penna. R. 485: \u201c The rule is unbroken, that dividends (annuities) are not subject to apportionment. They do not accrue from day to day, and it cannot be determined in what part of the year they have been earned.\u201d\n\u201c Still the thing which he (the testator) called a dividend was a periodical payment, becoming due at fixed times, and not due at all until declared.\u201d\nSee case stated, \u201c paid as it fell due quarterly.\u201d\nAnnuity payable on a day certain, and the annuitant die before that day, the annuity is lost: Cro. Eliz. 565; Wiggin v Sweet, 6 Met. 194.\nAn annuity by will, payable quarterly, the first payment is to be made three months after testator\u2019s death, and is not apportion-able : Hill on Trustees 585, in notes ; Tracy v. Strong, 2 Conn. 659; Franks v. Noble, 12 Ves. 484; Rop. on Leg. 878, 2 Am. ed.; Manning v. Randolph, 1 South. 144; Clapp v. Astor, 2 Edwards 383.\n\u201c When a certain sum is due on a given future day, no part is due till that day ; and it is fully settled by all the authorities that .there is no apportionment of an annuity:\u201d Tracy v. Strong, supra, per Swift, C. J.\nDividends of stock not apportionable, although if the money had been invested in land, it might have been: Rashleigh v. Master, 3 Bro. Ch. Ca. 99. There are one or two cases, in Pennsylvania, apportioning annuities which, though in the current of authority, neither obstruct its uniformity or deflect its course.\nSweigart v. Frey, 8 S. & R. 299. This case is relied on by the District Court, in Fisher v. Fisher, cited below, to authorize its decision. But an examination of the case will show that it was not a case of an annuity, but that the decision was based on its peculiar facts. Per Tilghman, C. J., page 305: The consideration of \u201c the bond (the interest on which was claimed to be apportionable) was a tract of land purchased by defendant, which had been devised to the widow for life, and, after her death, the land to be sold, and the proceeds of the sale divided. The widow and children came to an agreement to sell the land in her lifetime; and, in consideration of her joining in a deed to the defendant, she was to receive the interest of \u00bf61000 during her life, The objection is that the interest is payable yearly, but I apprehend that, in equity, in a contract like this, the interest acames from, day to day. Considering the circumstances and family agreement in in this case, to which the defendant was a party, it was a provision for the widow, for which she paid a valuable consideration.\u201d She conveyed (the land) to the defendant, and he enjoyed an estate -in the land during her life, for.which he agreed to pay the interest of \u00bf61000.\nThe next case is Gheen v. Osborn, 17 S. & R. 171: \u201c The bequest was to my wife, the sum of $100, to be paid to her out of my estate, yearly, and every year during her life, in lieu of dower, and charged this annual sum on the plantation devised to his son, who was also his executor.\u201d\nThe whole reasoning of the opinion is predicated of the full identity between an annuity charged on land and dower.\nPage 173: \u201c In case of intestacy, &c., the widow\u2019s share is left in the lands and charged on them by law, and the interest to be paid annually,\u201d \u201c and is always payable up to the death of the widowand Huston, J., says it is settled by Sweigart v. Frey, supra.\nThe next case is in the District Court, and ruled the case stated. It is reported in Am. Law Jour. Vol. IV., N. S., p. 539, as Fisher v. Fisher. Being their own decision, the court adhered to it \u201c until the Supreme Court reversed it.\u201d\nThe annuity was to be paid in \u201c equal quarterly payments, in each and every year, during her life, and to be paid out of the income of my real estate,\u201d and if the. real estate should be insufficient, then that a sufficient part of his personal estate should be invested in securities to make up any deficiency, so as to be paid without any abatement or deduction.\nAfter quoting Sweigart v. Frey and Gheen v. Osborn, the learned judge says, 11 after these cases, the question can scarcely be considered an open one.\u201d\nJohn Cr. Johnson, for defendant in error.\nIs an annuity, payable quarterly, given by a testator to his widow, in lieu of dower, apportionable, if she dies before the quarter-day ?\nWhilst the general principle in favour of a non-apportionment is beyond dispute, and needs no citations to sustain it, the above question has, by a host of decisions, been affirmatively decided. In favour of the presumed intention of the donor, courts of equity have established an exception in the case of gifts for maintenance of a wife, widow or child, now as strongly rooted as the rule, itself. Hay v. Palmer, 2 P. Wms. 501; Howell v. Hanforth, 2 W. Black. 1016; Webb v. Lord Shaftesbury, 11 Ves. 361; Regina v. Comms., 16 Ad. & El. N. S. 357; Williams on Executors 747; Hill on Trustees 385.\nThe cases so copiously cited by plaintiff in error, from the textbooks \u2014 even Tracy v. Story, which at first seeqis otherwise \u2014 are all outside the favoured class, and do not therefore assist him.\nThe greatest length to which the qualification in favour of maintenance has been extended is in Attorney-General v. Smithies, 16 Beav. 385, which decides that the income of a fund, having for its object the support, relief and maintenance of a master and five poor persons (strangers to the donor), is apportionable as between the executors of a deceased master and his successor.\nMcKeen\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 484, recognises the exception in these words : \u201c There are a few cases to be found in which apportionment of an annuity, given for the maintenance of a widow, or for the separate maintenance of a wife, has been decreed. I know of none in which it has been decreed against such person.\u201d\nIn Fisher v. Fisher, 4 Am. Law Jour., N. S. 539, a testator bequeathed to his widow an annuity, \u201c to be paid to her in equal quarterly payments, in each and every year during her natural life.\u201d Apportionment was decreed in favour of her representatives.\nSo in Smith v. Wistar, 20 Leg Int. 68, where there was a devise of certain ground-rents, payable half yearly to testator\u2019s wife for life.\nIn Sweigart v. Frey, 8 S. & R. 299, Tilghman, C. J., after alluding to other qualifications of the strict common law, says : \u201c I apprehend the rule is the same where provision is made for a widow.\u201d\nGheen v. Osborn, 17 S. & R. 171, is identical with the present case. The bequest was in these words: \u201c I do further bequeath to my said wife the sum of $100, to be paid to her out of my estate yearly, and every year during her natural life,\u201d * * * \u201c all which devises and bequests are given to my said wife in lieu of her dower.\u201d Testator died 16th May 1814; his wife died 22d March 1824, and her executor recovered the proportion from 16th May to 22d March.\nSays Huston, J.,, \u201c Dower lasts during th\u00e9 life of the widow, and it would be strange if what is granted in place of it would not last as long. No testator ever desired the last hours of his widow should he dependent on charity. It is in lieu of dower, and should last as long.\u201d\nJanuary 20th 1866,"
