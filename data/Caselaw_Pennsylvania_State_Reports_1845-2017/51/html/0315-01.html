Previous to the 9 &amp; 10 Yict. c. 93 (Lord Campbell’s Act), no action was maintainable against any person who by his wrongful act had caused the death of another. Injury to the person only created a right of personal action in the party injured, and if the injury was fatal, the right of action perished with that party. In that state of things Lord Campbell’s Act gave a right of action against the wrongdoer to the legal personal representatives of the party killed, for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent or child of that person.” After speaking of its effect upon collisions at sea, he said: “ In 1846 Lord Campbell’s Act, which I have mentioned, was passed. By that statute, after reciting that no action at law was then maintainable against a person who by his wrongful act, neglect or default, might have caused the death of another person — and it was oftentimes right and expedient that the wrongdoer in such case should be answerable in damages for the injuries so caused by him- — it was enacted that whensoever the death of a person should be caused by wrongful act, neglect or fault, and the act, neglect or default was such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the person to maintain an action and to recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case, the person -who would have been liable if death had not ensued, should be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the party injured, and although the death should have been caused under such circumstances as amounted in law to felony. By the second section it was further enacted, that every such action should be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death should have been caused, and should be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased, and in every such action, the jury were empowered to give such damages as they might think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death, to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action should be brought. That act imposed no limit as to the extent of damages to be recovered in actions ■brought by virtue of it, and accordingly in cases of collisions at ,-sea, the liability of the owners of the vessél in the wrong was .measured by and limited to the extent of the injury inflicted.”</p>

In Pym <em>v. </em>The Great Northern Railway Company, it being objected that the case did not come within the terms of the statute, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn said, “ In support of the first of these grounds of objection, the language of the first section of the act was relied on, and it was contended that inasmuch as, if death had not ensued from the effects of the accident, the deceased would have had no right of action against the company in respect of a pecuniary loss arising only on his death, this action could not be maintained by his representatives, inasmuch as the right of action is given only when the deceased could have maintained an action if death had not ensued. We were at first struck with -this argument, but on consideration we are of opinion, that the condition, that the action could have been maintained by the deceased if death had not ensued, has reference not to the loss or injury sustained but to the circumstances under which the bodily injury arose, and the nature of the wrongful act, neglect or default complained of. Thus, if the deceased had by his own negligence materially contributed to the accident whereby he lost his life, as he if still <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>living could not have maintained an action in respect of any bodily injury, notwithstanding there might have been negligence on the part of the defendants, the present action could not have been supported.

He refers to Mr. Justice Story’s Commentaries on Bailments, published in 1832, as furnishing a correct view of the decisions up to that time. “ Still, however,” says Judge Story, “it is to be understood that common carriers cannot, by any special agreement, exempt themselves from all responsibility, so as to evade altogether the salutary policy of the common law. They cannot, therefore, by a special notice exempt themselves from all responsibility in cases of gross negligence and fraud, or, by demanding an exorbitant price, compel the owner of the goods to yield to unjust and oppressive <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>limitations of tlieir rights.

Following the opinions of a majority of the judges, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cranworth, and Lord Wensleydale agreed in opinion, Lord Chelmsford dissenting, that the condition attempted to be imposed by the company was not a just and reasonable one, and that it was the duty of a court or judge so to declare; for if embodied in a contract its necessary effect would be “ that it would exempt the company from responsibility for injury however caused, including therefore gross negligence and even fraud or dishonesty on the part of the servants of the company. For the condition is expressed without any limitation or exception.” Such is the law of England at the present day, brought back to what was the original common-law rule by Act of Parliament and the salutary decision of their court of the last resort, the House of Lords.</p>

L. 674, no action to recover damages “for injuries to the person by negligence or default,” shall abate by plaintiff’s death, but his personal representatives may be substituted, and prosecute the suit to final judgment and satisfaction. “ That whenever death shall be occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence, and no suit for damages be brought by the party injured during his or her life, the widow of any such deceased, or if there be no, widow, the personal representatives, may maintain an action for and recover damages for the death thus occasioned.”</p>
    <p id="b329-8" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[190,1469,1164,815]]]'>This section is very inartificially drawn, two things being only distinctly set forth, that the suit by the widow, if there be one, must be for her exclusive benefit, and that the damages to be recovered are for the death only, there being no limitation as to the period in which the suit must be commenced. On the 26th April 1855, Pamph. L. 809, an act was passed relating to damages for injuries producing death, by which it rvas enacted, “ That the persons entitled to recover damages for any injury causing death, shall be the husband, widow, children or parent of the deceased, and no other relative, and the sum recovered shall go to them in the proportion they would take his or her personal estate in case of intestacy, and that without any liability to creditors.” The declaration must state who are the parties entitled, and the action must be brought within one year after the death. By a supplement of the 10th December 1856 (Pamph. L. of 1857, App. p. 798), the foregoing act was not to be construed retrospectively, either as to rights of action accrued or actions pending, but that the limitation of one year shall be restricted to cases occurring from and after the passage of said act.</p>

The last ease was tried before the present chief justice, at Nisi Prius, and was argued by me in that court and in the Supreme Court, and upon looking at my paper-book, I find the latest English cases as Ayell as our own were brought to the attention of the court. The agreement or release in this case relieved the company from all responsibility for any injury to person or property in the transportation of live-stock, and the learned judge charged the jury that <em>“ </em>the carrier is bound, notwithstanding such a contract, to use ordinary diligence, such as a man of common prudence ordinarily employs in his own concerns ; and if he fail in this and loss ensues therefrom, he is liable in damages. This company, holding itself out as a common carrier, and professing to have a railway, cars and facilities for the transportation of live stock, were bound, even after the plaintiff had signed the release, by the rule of ordinary diligence and care. The effect of the contract was to take away the insurance against all risks, to abridge their common-law liabilities, but not to excuse them for the want of ordinary care in the execution of the duty voluntarily assumed.” And Chief Justice Lowrie, in delivering the opinion of the court in banc, stated this proposition, that “ a contract limiting their liability as carriers, does not relieve them from ordinary care in the performance of their duty; and the most it can do is to relieve them from those conclusive presumptions of negligence which arise when the accident is not inevitable, even by the highest care, and to require that negligence be actually proved against them.”</p>

The same doctrine is affirmed in broad terms by the present chief justice in Powell <em>v. </em>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 8 Casey 414, 416 : “ Whoever has been attentive to the course of decision in this court for the last few years on questions between railroad companies and those whom they have injured in person or property, cannot have failed to observe that, on the one hand, we accept no excuse from the party who obstructs the track or interferes with the transportation of the company ; and on the other, that we hold companies bound to transport safely, or to respond in damages, except where the injury has resulted from the act of God or the concurring negligence of the party complaining.” In this case there was a similar release of the company from all claims for damage or injury to the stock, and the court said, “ The ruling of the learned judge cannot be justified on the ground of the release signed by the plaintiff, because that has been held <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>to be no excuse for negligence.

    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[205,772,1161,464]]]'>In the case before us, on the back of the ticket issued to the drover in charge of the stock, and addressed to the conductor of the passenger car attached to the eastern' bound stock train was this endorsement: “ The person accepting this free ticket assumes all risks of accidents, and expressly agrees that the company shall not be liable, under any circumstances, whether of negligence by its agents or otherwise, for any injury to the person, or for any loss or injury to the personal property of the party using this ticket.” Then follow the rules for issuing drovers’ passes, one to either one or two car-loads of stock, two for not less than six, and four for ten car-loads or more.</p>
    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[205,1245,1160,259]]]'>As it is absolutely necessary, in carrying stock, that the persons who have charge of them should be carried by the company, the price paid for the freight includes the cost of transporting the drover, who is not therefore a gratuitous but a paying passenger, and the word <em>“ </em>free” is therefore only true so far as that the conductor is not entitled to charge him separately for his passage.</p>

It was really caused by an imperfection or defect in the road, which was removed by the company as soon as this accident happened. Nothing can be so permanently dangerous as placing a platform for passengers between the two tracks of a railroad. ’</p>
