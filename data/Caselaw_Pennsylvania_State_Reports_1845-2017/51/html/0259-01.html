At the time of the transaction, Wayte told Heilbruner &amp; Co. that he wished both their names and Kelso’s on the note, and Heilbruner &amp; Co. told Kelso to sign it, and that he should have no trouble. It was signed and endorsed, and delivered to Wayte. There was other evidence also that Heilbruner &amp; Co. recognised their obligation to pay the note. Wayte afterwards, when about to negotiate the note, endorsed it, writing his name above Heilbruner &amp; Co. Suit was brought against Kelso on the note, and judgment recovered ; but before execution could be issued on it, all his property was sold under other judgments. After this Kelso was insolvent until his death. Heilbruner &amp; Co. alleged that a large portion of the timber was rotten, and claimed a reduction of the note on that account. There was evidence on this point on both sides, amongst which was the testimony of the public measurer. ’</p>

But a conclusion of this kind is not to be arrived at without satisfactory evidence of the defect. The measurer is generally a sworn officer, and what he does is to be taken at least as <em>primá facie </em>evidence that his measurement was correct, and he does not pontradict this in any part of his testimony which the defendants have read. Other witnesses speak differently of the character of the timber, and it is for the jury to judge and determine between them.”</p>

It is true the judge omitted in his statement material facts bearing upon the ease ; but this was prejudicial to the plaintiff and not to the defendant. The proof is clear and without contradiction that the note in question was given by Heilbruner &amp; Co. upon the purchase of the timber, and by their bargain -was to be endorsed by them. They were the purchasers of the timber, and were to pay for it by getting Kelso’s note — and did so; and at the time of the transaction he was expressly told by them he would have no trouble.</p>

In their letter^to Kelso, Heilbruner &amp; Co. afterwards acknowledge the debt as their own, tell him he shall have no trouble, and say they will pay Wayte any day if he takes off the amount of the rotten timber. The facts clearly sustain the instruction of the court, and although not mentioned fully, it is very clear the judge did not intend to ignore them.</p>
