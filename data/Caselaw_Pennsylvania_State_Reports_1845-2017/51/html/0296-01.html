On the 26th of September 1860, the viewers reported a road between the’said points, which was read same day and so endorsed on the report. Nothing further was done until November 12th 1863, when a petition was presented reciting the laying out of the above road, and asking for the appointment of “ proper persons to review said road.” Reviewers were appointed the same day, who reported a road. The report was filed January 8th 1864; and, after various proceedings in relation to it, the court, April 5th 1865, set aside the report of the viewers, confirmed the report of the reviewers and ordered the road to be opened forty feet wide.</p>

The 25th section of the General Road Law of 13th June 1836, directs a second view or review, “ provided that application therefor be made at or before the next term of the said court after the report upon the first view.” This provision has always been looked upon as mandatory. There are good reasons founded in the necessity for speedy action, in order that the report upon the first view may be considered in due season, and while the parties are supposed to be in waiting to take care of their interests. Changes in the route of a road cannot be made unless by review until after confirmation of the report, and the road has been opened, in whole according to the Act of 1836, or in part under the Act of 3d May 1855; and certainly it is asking too much that the parties should be compelled to be in court for an indefinite length of time, to keep watch over the proceedings, and to see that the route originally viewed to their satisfaction, shall not be changed to their disadvantage by a review. The law has therefore fixed the next term after the report for the application for a review. Analogous principles were asserted in the cases of the Baldwin Road, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Grant%2063" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Grant 63">3 Grant 63</a>, and the Heidelberg Road, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20536" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="11 Wright 536">11 Wright 536</a>.</p>
