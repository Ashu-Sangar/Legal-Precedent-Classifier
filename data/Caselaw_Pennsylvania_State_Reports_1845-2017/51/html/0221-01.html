Before this writ, the act provides that the court shall allow the persons suing or defending <em>“ </em>such convenient time to make return, plead, reply, rejoin or demur as shall be just and reasonable.” If, after issue and trial, the return be adjudged insufficient, then a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>issues to compel the performance of the duty required.
