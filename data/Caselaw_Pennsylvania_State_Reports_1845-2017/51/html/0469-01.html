But in Pennsylvania, in each instance in which this doctrine has been maintained, there appeared undoubted proof of the existence of a license* in favour of the party before the court, or in the person or persons through whom he claimed. In the case before us there is a total absence of direct testimony proving that a parol license existed, and the inferential evidence offered by no means establishes the fact; the existence or non-existence of a license is therefore the subject of grave doubt. And hence, if the complainant expects to sustain the position assumed by him, he must rely upon an adverse and immemorial usage and uninterrupted enjoyment for a period of time sufficiently long to raise, in point of law, the presumption which presupposes a grant. See Esling <em>v. </em>Williams, 10 Barr 126; Garrett <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Harris 335. The evidence establishes the fact that complainant has <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>enjoyed the use of the switch for seventeen or eighteen years on payment of toil; a period of time, it is true, of considerable length, and yet not sufficiently long to establish the right contended for. While we are ready to admit that where a party has induced another to expend time, money and labour on the faith of a promise, equity will compel the promissor to do that which ought to have been done, and will protect the promissee in the enjoyment of the thing promised ; yet, in the absence of satisfactory proof of an agreement, license or promisé, the court ought to determine the conflicting rights of parties according to those legal and equitable presumptions which have repeatedly been the subject of judicial determination, and which have, therefore, received legal interpretation and definite limits.</p>

Now, Heyl understood perfectly when he constructed his ‘ switch,’ that he did so subject to the rights and powers of those corporations, specified in their charters. By the Act of Assembly of April 2d 1831, and supplements thereto, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company had the right to demand and re'ceive such sum or sums of money for tolls of persons or property as they should-from time to time think reasonable, &amp;c.; but both of these companies had; by their charters, the right to make such regulations as the directors should deem advisable, for each road is declared ‘ to be a public highway for the conveyance of passengers and transportation of merchandise and commodities, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by the directors.’</p>

From the mere existence and use of the turn-out from the track for seventeen years, and the receipts for mending the siding, and the expense of the castings, &amp;c., we are asked to infer an agreement for an absolute, enduring and irrevocable right to maintain a private switch and frogs in the track of a railroad, built under a charter for general railroad purposes. The limited use of the track heretofore cannot change the character of the powers and duties of the company. We can infer a permissive use of the track in this way from the facts in evidence.

So the frogs lie directly in the line of travel, obstructing its free use, and causing great wear and tear of machinery. How can it be supposed a company chartered to build a highway for the conveyance of passengers, and the transportation of merchandise, intended, when it suffered this direct interference with its track, to concede a right to maintain it for ever, no matter what might be the increased demands of travel and trade, and the changes of business ? . How can it be supposed that the plaintiff himself, who must be presumed to know the public objects of such a highway, would be so misled as to believe he was acquiring an enduring right to control the use of the highway to his private ends ? It is inconceivable that any one should think that a mere act of sufferance would vest in him a permanent title to maintain an opening and a damaging obstruction to the track free of all charge. There is no agreement, and not being misled, there can he no estoppel.. In order that the improvements on his own lot to adapt it to his trade should operate, he must convince us that they were induced by such acts and representations of the. defendants as warranted him fully in believing that the right conceded to him was such as he sets forth in his bill.</p>

The nature of the property, the duties of the corporation, its limited powers, and the character of the gap in one track and of the' obstruction in the other, all unite, in the absence of express agreement, to convince us that no fixed, unalterable and unburthened privilege was conceded.
