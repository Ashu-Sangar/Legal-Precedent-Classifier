The object of the legislation was to enable petitioners to get access to established highways and to places of necessary resort, that they might not be shut out of the world ; but for a private road which like this starts from a turnpike and ends upon a creek, there is no authority in the statute. The court had no jurisdiction to establish a private road between such points : and besides the report of viewers was fatally defective in not setting forth that the road was necessary, as the 12th section requires.</p>
