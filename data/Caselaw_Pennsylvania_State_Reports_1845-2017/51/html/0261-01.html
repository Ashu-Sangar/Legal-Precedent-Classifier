The testimony of John Snider and Alfred Howell for the plaintiff, as to the possession of the defendant, and of Judge Ewing as to his relation as a tenant and the tender of rent, were sufficient to carry the case to the jury, who found the facts against the defendant. We must therefore assume that Jacob S. Hayden came into possession of the premises described in the declaration under Benjamin Hayden, who, according to Judge Ewing’s testimony, was in possession under Worthington with an understanding that he should pay rent, though the sum had not been definitely fixed. Alfred Patterson, Esq., the plaintiff below, purchased Worthington’s title and received the sheriff’s deed therefor in July 1863, while Hayden, the defendant, according to Snider’s testimony, was in possession from the 3d of March 1863 until the 1st of April 1864.

The terms of the law are sufficiently broad to include all persons holding under the owner whose title is sold, whether as tenants by express lease for a stipulated sum, or as occupants by possession. Wherever the owner himself could maintain .an action for use and occupation, undoubtedly the same remedy lies in favour of the purchaser of his title at sheriff’s sale for any sum accruing after he has received his deed.

But there is nothing to prevent a tenant in common in possession from letting out his share of the common property, and receiving rent for it.
