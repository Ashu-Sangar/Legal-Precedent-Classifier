The action is £ Replevin.’ The plea is £ Property.’ There is no dispute about the place where the timber was cut or the parties who cut and removed it. Who owned the land on which it grew ? is the question presented. Each party claims-to have such ownership, or such a right to the possession as will sustain a claim to the timber. The plaintiff claims it by two separate and independent titles. Originally the land belonged to the trustees of the Bingham estate, who conveyed it, with their other 'lands in Clarion county, to Lane &amp; Mylert. By contract dated July 29th 1854, Lane &amp; Mylert sold it to Isaac Clover, who, by assignment dated the 12th of May 1855, transferred it to the plaintiff. On the 27th of January 1862', the plaintiff, by his agent, J. W. Guthrie, entered into a contract with the defendants (except Frazier, who was merely a jobber.), to sell them this land, and one or two other pieces, at $8 per acre, of which they paid down $2550, agreed to pay Campbell &amp; Bredin, the assignees of Lane &amp; Mylert, the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>balance of purchase-money, amounting to $3550, and pay to plaintiff the balance of what the whole would amount to at the price agreed on, in two annual payments. They took an assignment of the Clover &amp; McOlosky contracts, took a receipt for the money paid, and then appended to it a stipulation signed by both parties, that the defendants should have sixty days in which to examine the lands, and elect to take or refuse them; and in case they elected not to take them, the plaintiff was to refund to them the $2550 advanced, within four months, and that contract to be void on his failure to do so. The defendants examined the land, and on the 28th day of February 1862, adjusted the balance of the ■purchase-money with Campbell &amp; Bredin, and took a deed to themselves for it. At least this is the date of the deed and its acknowledgment by one of its grantors residing in Butler; the other, residing in Clarion, not having acknowledged it until the 26th day of March 1862, on which day it was also placed on record in Clarion county. On the same 26th of March 1862, the defendants served a written notice on the plaintiff’s agent that they refused to take the land referred to in their contract of January 27th 1862, and demanding the repayment of the $2550 advanced by them, according to its terms and stipulations. Within the four months stipulated in the contract for its repayment, viz., on the 27th day of May 1862, Mr. Guthrie, on behalf of the plaintiff, made a tender of the money to John Black, one of the defendants, at his store in Pittsburgh. This tender, under the circumstances as made, we say to you was sufficient. The defendant Black having refused to take, touch, or count it, and making no objection, either to its quantity or quality, nor disputing Mr. Guthrie when he called it $2660, waived his right to take any exception to it here, or at least brought on himself the burden of proving there was not the requisite amount. Under this state of facts the plaintiff claims to ¿ave been reinstated in all his former rights of ownership in the land in question. We cannot see why he is not. The contract of sale Avas conditional. No actual possession was delivered or taken. Within the time specified the defendants gave notice of their election not to buy and of their rescission of the contract. Thereafter they could hold the articles and assignments of plaintiff, if at all, only as security or pledge for the repayment of the money advanced. Even if good for that purpose, their equities would be extinguished by the tender made. Their- purchase of the legal title from Campbell &amp; Bredin, at the same time they Avere giving notice of their election not to purchase from the plaintiff, subjects them to a suspicion of bad faith towards him in the transaction. They acquired no right under their contract Avith the plaintiff to do it, only in the event of their election to buy from him, and in doing it, they acquired no rights but such as their grantors, Campbell <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>&amp; Breclin, possessed. They thus acquired the right to enforce payment of the balance of purchase-money by legal process, but not the right to enter upon the land and take off the timber.</p>

In June 1863, they sold it to J. R. Clark, and Clark and wife conveyed the same to Frank B.

Fleming, the plaintiff below, brought replevin for ten thousand feet of timber cut by George Frazier for Williams, Black &amp; Co., upon a tract of land claimed by both parties. Fleming claims as equitable owner of the land, through a purchase by Isaac Clover from Lane &amp; Mylert in 1854; Williams, Black &amp; Co. claim the same land, first by purchase from Fleming, and secondly by conveyance of the legal title to them from Bredin &amp; Campbell, purchasers of Lane &amp; Mylert’s title.</p>

J. W. Guthrie acting as agent for Fleming proposed a sale to Williams, Black &amp; Co. at $8 per acre for the whole, which the latter accepted. The* writings consisted of two instruments, dated the 27th January 1862. In one, Guthrie as attorney of Fleming assigned to them all the estate and title of Fleming, and authorized Campbell &amp; Bredin to convey to them on their paying to Campbell &amp; Bredin $3500, in certain instalments. In the other, which was partly in the form of a receipt, but was subscribed by both parties, he acknowledged the receipt of $2500 upon a sale of the land, and agreed that Williams, Black &amp; Co., who lived in Pittsburgh, should have sixty days to examine the lands, and if at the expiration of that time they did not pay the balance coming to Campbell &amp; Bredin, and the balance to Fleming, calculating the whole land, at $8 per acre, then Fleming should refund to them the $2500 without interest within four months from date, and on failure to do so the agreement to become null and void. _ On the 10th of March following, Williams, Black &amp; Co. made out a written notice to Guthrie that they would not take the land at the price designated, and that they expected him to refund the money paid according to the agreement. This was served on Guthrie on the 26th March 1862. In the mean time, however, Williams, Black &amp; Co. arranged with Campbell &amp; Bredin for the balance of the purchase-money on the Clover contract, and got from them a conveyance of the legal title. This deed bore date on the 28th February 1862, but was not finally acknowledged until the 26th of March 1862, and was recorded on that day, being the same day on which the notice was served by Williams, Black &amp; Co. that they would not take the land under their purchase from Fleming. On the last day of the four months given to Fleming to refund the $2500 paid by Williams, Black &amp; Co., Guthrie on his behalf tendered the money to Mr. Black. There is no evidence showing that in the mean time, or indeed at any time, Williams, Black &amp; Co. recalled their notice, or reinstated themselves upon their contract by tendering to Fleming the balance <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>due him. They indeed, in the court below, raised the question as to the sufficiency of the tender to them by Guthrie ; but we discover no error in the instruction of the court upon the facts stated in the charge. Nor was there any evidence in the case which would justify the jury in finding the tender was not made in good faith, though the question was submitted to them by the judge in his answer to their sixth point.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[186,684,1169,1079]]]'>As the case stood after the notice and non-performance on one side, and the tender on the other, the purchase by Williams, Black &amp; Co. of Fleming’s equitable title was at an end, and they were left standing in the shoes of Campbell &amp; Bredin, and clothed only with the bare legal title, and their rights under the'Clover contract. It was in the following winter that the timber was cut by Frazier under a contract of some kind with Williams, Black &amp; Co. Their right to authorize him to cut and take the timber depended, therefore, not on their purchase from Fleming, which was ended by their own act, but upon the right of Campbell &amp; Bredin under the contract of sale by Lane &amp; Mylert to Clover. If Clover had been let into possession, or had the right to enter under his contract and take possession, his vendors Lane &amp; Mylert and their assigns had no right to enter to cut timber. As holders of the legal title they were trustees of it for Clover the vendee, who, by the equitable conversion created by the sale, was the equitable owner of the estate, and entitled to its fruits: Longwell <em>v. </em>Bentler, 11 Harris 102 ; Siter, James &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 2 Casey 180 ; Morgan <em>v. </em>Scott, Id. 51. Their right was simply to enforce payment of the purchase-money in the proper legal form; and if they entered upon the vendee after letting him into a possession or covenanting to do so, they were liable to restore the possession without a tender of the balance of the purchase-money: Basler <em>v. </em>Niesly, 2 S. &amp; R. 352; Harris <em>v. </em>Bell, 10 Id. 39; D’Arras <em>v. </em>Keyser, 2 Casey 252.</p>

This it appears was given in evidence by Fleming. But no copy of this paper is spread upon our paper-book, no point was made upon its terms at the trial, and no exception taken to that portion of the charge of the court in which the jury were told that as purchasers under Campbell &amp; Bredin, Williams, Black &amp; Co. had no right to enter upon the land and take off the timber. In this- state of the record, the presumption is that the terms of Clover’s contract justified the court in charging in answer to the plaintiff’s second point, that the right of possession remained in Fleming at the time the timber was cut by the defendant. Exception was taken, it is true, to the answer to this point, but it is- grounded, not upon the terms of Clover’s article, but upon the effect of Fleming’s sale to Williams, Black &amp; Co. This will be seen both in the terms of <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>the point itself, and the argument founded upon the assignment of error to this answer, the eighth, and also upon the sixth assignment of error.</p>

But this is a blending of things essentially different. Admitting that they might purchase the legal title of Campbell &amp; Bredin; and, if it were possible, use it to secure the money paid by them on their purchase of Fleming; what right, in law or equity, remained to them in Fleming’s equitable estate, after they had expressly refused to take it, or to pay for it at the expiration of the sixty days, and after his tender of a return of the money they had paid him, without any recall of their refusal in the mean time or any attempt at performance ? Their contract with him was at an end. It was not a mere rescission of it by subsequent agreement, but it contained within itself the terms of its own dissolution. They had sixty days to repent in, and they did so. When they gave notice of this; failed to pay at the end of the time, and Fleming, accepting their own construction of the contract, tendered a return of the money; clearly all the force of the contract was spent, all rights of purchase under it ceased, and Williams, Black &amp; Co. fell back upon the bare legal title: and even the right to use it to enforce payment of money actually tendered to and refused by them, differs essentially from a right to the equitable estate of Fleming, which alone could carry with it the right to the timber. It is the right to the possession of the land when the timber was cut, this being an action of replevin, which is the point to be established, and not the enforcement of the payment of the purchase-money, or how much should be tendered under the Clover contract. If Fleming’s equitable estate was not in them when the timber was cut and removed, but remained in him by their disaffirmance of the sale and his tender of the return of their money, they had no title to the timber ; and this is the only question. To what extent Williams, Black &amp; Co. can use the legal title is not a question 'here ; though it may be seriously questioned how far it can be held as á security beyond the sum of $3500 actually paid, or se'eured to be paid, to Campbell &amp; Bredin. Campbell &amp; Bredin’s offer to reduce the sum due to that amount, and to give one and two years for its payment, was not made to them or for their benefit, and they only secured the position they hold by using their contract with Fleming. After disaffirmance and the tender of the money, can they in equity use the legal <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>title to compel payment of more than the $3500 ?

    <p id="b115-7" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[204,1337,1171,908]]]'>According to the authority of these cases, neither trover nor replevin lies against one in the actual possession of land claiming title for timber, slate, or other products severed by him from the freehold, nor even when there is a common possession, and the title is in controversy. But it does lie in favour of the owner, in possession actually or constructively against a tortfeasor or one who has no right of possession, who enters only casually or temporarily to cut timber: Wright <em>v. </em>Guyer, <a href="/watts/9/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="9 Watts 172" data-case-ids="1850021" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0172-01">9 Watts 172</a>; Elliott <em>v. </em>Powell, 10 Id. 454; Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 3 Harris 509 ; Clement <em>v. </em>Wright, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20250" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="4 Wright 250">4 Wright 250</a>, and the analogous case of Altemose <em>v. </em>Hufsmith, 9 Id. 121. This view of the relation of Williams, Black &amp; Co. to the land in effect disposes of all the errors assigned, except the third and fourth. Fleming’s ownership of the timber, as the equitable owner of the land, renders it unnecessary to call to his aid the assignment of the timber to him by F. B. Guthrie, the owner of the tax title, and therefore all the errors arising upon that branch of the case become immaterial. So also the questions upon the rights of Williams, Black &amp; Co., under the purchase of the legal title, are out of the case, for they belong to a different controversy, to be settled when they undertake to enforce their rights under the Clover contract.</p>

Why Fleming objected to it, it is difficult to say, for it tended to prove more directly that <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>the motive of Williams, Black &amp; Co. in procuring the title from Campbell &amp; Bredin, was not performance of the contract with Fleming, but security for the money paid to him. This was a strong corroboration of their intention to disaffirm the contract, as it was only in that event security was needed. The fourth assignment of error is also without foundation, for the fact that Fleming employed Coogan to show Williams, Black &amp; Co. only the better portions of the land when examining it, if it was a fraud,could only result in relief from their purchase ; and this they had of themselves, by their higher right of disaffirmance of the contract by virtue of its own terms. In this action the fraud' was irrelevant, therefore, as a ground of relief from a contract already ended by their own act.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[277,946,1162,76]]]'>Finding nothing on the record to correct, the judgment is affirmed.</p>
