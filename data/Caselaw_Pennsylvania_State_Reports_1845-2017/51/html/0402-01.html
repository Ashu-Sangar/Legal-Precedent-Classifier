If it rested on- this policy alone, it is not pretended there was an over-insurance. It is the existence of other policies beyond the limited amount that gives rise to the excess. Policies to have that effect must be subsisting and available. . If they were void from the beginning, had expired by their own limitation, or became void by matter subs'equent, they would not constitute an obstacle in the plaintiffs’ way. If, however, they were available at any time before the loss, and thus operated as a forfeiture of defendants’ policy, and became otherwise by the default of the plaintiffs themselves, they cannot he permitted to avail themselves of it, and by that means restore the policy of the defendants.”</p>

      <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>Answer: “ The ground upon which it is sought to avoid the policies is as set forth in the third and fourth points of plaintiffs. The third point, as I read it, assumes that there were such encumbrances created, and such assignments as avoided the policies. There were, as the evidence shows, such liens and encumbrances as might have avoided these policies of the Pittsburgh companies; but having been renewed from time to time and assessments paid,1 the plaintiffs themselves averring them to be subsisting by swearing to their existence in their notice of loss, by instituting suits in this county, and in one case accepting a compromise, it does not lie in the mouth of plaintiffs to avoid them in this case. We do not look upon these facts as rendering them absolutely void, but voidable only, and if the plaintiffs insist'upon their availability, and the company acquiesced and compromised, they would be subsisting and available so far as the parties treated them, and at least as to the company compromising. Whether under any circumstances third parties can insist upon contracts between others, when those others have not availed themselves of it, may be doubtful. Perhaps they may in some instances, where the contract is absolutely void or manifestly at an end ;• but where the plaintiffs aver their availability it does not become them to blow hot and cold, and in a proceeding with other parties, not parties to the contract, insist on them being void. We therefore answer the third point in the negative.”</p>

In answering the plaintiffs’ fourth point, which point and answer are: “ That there is no over-insurance by reaslon of taking the policies in the Cumberland Valley Protection Company, the Pittsburgh Life, Fire and Marine, and the Pennsylvania Insurance Companies, for the reason that the risk is not the same as that in the Lycoming Insurance Company policy, and on that ground the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-7" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[212,1738,1154,343]]]'>Answer: <em>“ </em>In the case of the Cumberland Valley Company and the other companies, they are sought to be avoided because the risk is not the same ; the description of the premises and property being different from the defendants’ policy. I have examined all these policies carefully and compared them, and as I read them, there is no substantial difference. There is simply a variation in phraseology, but none in the substantial description of the property. We therefore answer the fourth point in the negative.”</p>

      <em>7. </em>In answering the plaintiffs’ fifth point, which point and answer are: <em>“ </em>That there is no over-insurance by reason of taking the policies in the Cumberland Valley Protection Company, inasmuch as they do not, with the Lycoming Insurance Company policy, make the insurance more than two-thirds of the. estimated value.”</p>

Throwing out of view entirely the Pittsburgh policies, the matter would <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>stand thus: the value of the property being $11,810, the two-thirds would be ; that was the extent to which the plaintiffs could go consistently with their covenants in Lycoming Company ; if they did go beyond that, we have seen that it avoided the policy in suit. The amount of this policy is $5000, and the. amount insured in the Cumberland Yalley Company being $3500, together making $8500, which exceeds the limits of their right to insure to the amount of $626.68. This over-insurance would be as effectual, to avoid the defendants’ policies, as if the Pittsburgh policies were also included. This fifth point is also answered in the negative.”</p>

In answering plaintiffs’ sixth point, which point and answer are: “That if the Cumberland Yalley insurance does create an insurance beyond the two-thirds of the estimated value, the endorsements on the policy, by Mr. McCabe, the agent of the Lycoming Company, would be a waiver of the right of the company to claim a forfeiture.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b406-7" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[258,1124,1164,1073]]]'>Answer: “ The answer to plaintiffs’ sixth point involves some review of the facts. McCabe was a local agent. His power of attorney defined his powers and duties in conformity with the by-laws ; they were to make surveys, and take and transmit applications for insurance, serve notices and collect assessments. He had no power to issue policies, or bind the company by any contract; that function was withheld from his powers, and vested alone in the company or the secretary. There can be no doubt that what an agent says and does, while engaged in the discharge of a duty, is part of the act, and binding upon the principal. While engaged merely in assenting to an assignment, what he said and did in reference to that, would be a part of the act, and as such binding on the company; but anything said or done on other subjects than the one engaged in, his act would not bind the company, unless transmitted and ratified. At the time McCabe approved the transfer from Mitchell to Ralston, Carter &amp; Ellis the Cumberland Yalley policies were laid before him, but there is no notice that he transmitted them to the company, or that they knew of or ratified them. Nothing more occurred on these occasions than a simple inspection of the policies, from which it is .sought to affect the company with a ratification. Suppose McCabe had expressly ratified them in terms, would it have bound the company ? We think not, considering that McOg.be had no more power to ratify than he had to issue original policies to bind the company.</p>

Assuming it, however, to be true, it proves that McCabe came to the mill for what purpose ? Merely to serve a notice of an assessment, No. 15. ' While thus engaged, Ellis complained that he had lost a receipt, and McCabe <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>endorsed an acknowledgment of the receipt on the notice. In the course of the interview the policies were all produced, and McCabe looked at them, and said they were all right. If he even had the power to ratify, I doubt whether this casual inspection, without having his attention drawn toward ratification, would operate as such. But as mentioned above, we do not think he had any such power, and that his knowledge of the existence of these policies, without apprising the company of them,'would not operate as a ratification. This sixth point is therefore answered in the negative.”</p>

In charging the jury: “ The result, then, of the whole case is this: the policy in suit provides for a forfeiture in case of excessive insurance. The valuation was $11,810. The aggregate insurance was $12,000, a great excess, that if valid, would entirely work a forfeiture. We think, so far as regards this case, they are all to be considered as valid. But if the Pittsburgh policies were even unavailable, still this policy and the Cumberland Yalley ones exceeded the amount by upwards of $600. Even this would operate as a forfeiture.</p>

We also concur with him, that a breach of the covenant not to insure beyond two-thirds of the estimated value, was a forfeiture of the policy. This was .our judgment when this case was here before (<a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20368" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="12 Wright 368">12 Wright 368</a>), and the point had been decided in Lycoming Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Slockbower, 2 Casey 199. We see no reason to retract. Good faith is the life-breath of insurance where a heavy risk is taken for a small premium. The right to insure <em>ad libitum </em>is detrimental to good faith, leading always to carelessness and often to fraud. The limitation of the insurance to two-thirds of the estimated value is therefore essential to secure fidelity, and to make the assured watchful over his own interest in the remainder. It is a fundamental condition in procuring the policy. Its violation runs back, therefore, to the issuing of the policy, and undermines the very ground on which its origin stands; and forfeiture is the necessary penalty and protection of the contract. The covenant against insurance over two-thirds has no relation to the <em>pro rata </em>clause, which refers to additional insurance when less than two-thirds. The over-insurance was attempted to be surmounted by the alleged invalidity of the subsequent policies. We think the court adopted the proper distinction — if they were void at the time of the loss they constituted no obstacle; but if voidable only by reason of some breach of condition enabling the insurers to avoid them but which they had waived, the over-insurance undoubtedly existed. None of the cited cases to be looked upon as authority carry the doctrine <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>beyond. Omitting the Pittsburgh policies, the two granted by the Cumberland Yalley Company, added to the one in suit, made the total insurance $&gt;8500, which is more than the two-thirds of the estimated value. These two were not void, either .in the beginning or afterwards, and had not expired by efflux of time, and were actually sued and paid. The plaintiff was therefore driven to contend that they did not cover the same property, and complains here that this fact ought to have been submitted to the jury. Had the question been one of identity in the application of the terms of the description to the property described, it belonged to the jury. But this was not the real question before the court. There was no dispute as to the identity of the property described, but the real question was, whether the terms of the two Cumberland Yalley policies were substantially the same as the terms of the policy in suit. This was a subject of comparison between the writings, and not of extrinsic proof; unless, indeed, the plaintiff had given evidence of the property described which would vary the application of the language to the subjects of description in the different policies. But, without this proof, the jury would have nothing to determine their decision but the language of the policies, which would be to refer to them the mere construction of the writings, contrary to the rule which gives it to the court. We agree with the learned judge that substantially the description in the different policies is the same.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[303,1426,1159,988]],["BL_411.1",411,[169,387,1161,1207]]]'>Failing in this, the plaintiff next resorted to the allegation that the defendants knew the fact of over-insurance and waived it. There is no proof of actual knowledge — the contrary is expressly proved. But McCabe, the agent who consented to the assignment of the policy by Mitchell to Ralston, Ellis and Carter, undoubtedly did know of it, and made a memorandum of the subsequent policies in the same writing containing his consent. This brings up the extent of his authority and his power to commit the company by his knowledge. He held a written appointment as local agent of the company under a bond for his faithful performance of the duties required of him in accordance with the by-laws. The section read in evidence made it the duty of the agent to take surveys and receive applications for insurance, and, when required, to examine into the circumstances of a loss and make report. Under the regulations printed on the back of the policy the agent is also empowered to approve of assignments of the policy following a sale of the property, and to demand payment of assessments. Now it is very clear none of these powers authorize an agent to accept notice of over-insurance, and visit the company with a waiver of its consequences. Indeed no notice is required to be given of additional insurance within the limit until the assured comes to make proof of his loss, and then merely to enable the company to avail itself <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>of its right to pay but <em>pro rata. </em>But the act of over-insurance is a forbidden act and not the subject of authorized waiver, by any officer or agent under the rules and regulations prescribed. It is on the principle of estoppel and not of authority, the waiver takes effect. The knowledge of a mere agent unauthorized to represent the company beyond the specific powers committed to him, cannot be the ground of estoppel in a matter unconnected with the exercise of his powers. This can take place only when the knowledge, lying at the foundation of the estoppel, comes home to these officers who exercise the corporate powers of the company, or to an agent whose powers relate to the very subject out of which the estoppel arises. These general principles are made doubly binding upon the assured in this instance by his relation. He becomes a member of the corporation by the act of insurance, and therefore bound to become informed of its rules and regulations: Hackney <em>v. </em>Allegheny Mutual Ins. Co., 4 Barr 185. These views dispose of the testimony of Snyder, the notice of assessment and acknowledgment of payment endorsed, and McCabe’s written memorandum. His being engaged in the notification or collection of assessments or approval of the assignment, carried with it no authority to receive notice of the over-insurance and no duty to communicate it to the company. As a member of this company, the plaintiff was no stranger to the powers committed to the local agents under its rules and regulations. He had no right to believe that notice to this agent could relieve him from the forfeiture of his policy, or that his knowledge was notice to the company. No implied waiver or estoppel, therefore, arose out of his knowledge.</p>
