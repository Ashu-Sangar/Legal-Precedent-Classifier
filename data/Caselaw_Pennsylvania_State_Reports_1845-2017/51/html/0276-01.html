It was also shown that on the 12th June 1826, this tract, then the property of Parker, was sold for, taxes, and on the 26th February it was redeemed by Thomak J ackson for Samuel Parker; that it was afterwards assessed to the heirs of Samuel Parker, and the taxes paid by Thomas Jackson on the 9th of January 1838 and the 9th of March 1840, and of course in his character of agent under his power of attorney.
