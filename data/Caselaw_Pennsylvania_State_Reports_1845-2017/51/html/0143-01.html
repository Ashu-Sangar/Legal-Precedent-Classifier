And 'first, it is very clear this act was not in violation of any <em>express </em>provision in the policy. It expressly provides that oil in <em>barrels </em>may be carried on barges, which could only be done by placing them on the deck when the barge was fitted up, as is universally the case for carrying oil in bulk.

It is the duty of the owner to have the ship properly equipped, and for that purpose it is necessary that he should provide a competent master and crew in the first instance; but having done that, he has discharged his duty, and is not responsible for their negligence, as between him and the underwriters.’ The same principle is laid down in Bishop <em>v. </em>Pentland, 7 B. &amp; Cress. 218, where the foregoing cases are cited and approved. See also Holdsworth <em>v. </em>Wise, Id. 794, and note 798, where Lord Tenterden, C.

Justice Story, delivering the opinion of the court, goes into a thorough examination of both the English and American cases, and lays down the rule as follows: ‘ Whether the risk of barratry is taken or not, a loss whose proximate cause was a peril insured against, is within the policy,'though remotely occasioned by the negligence of the master and crew.’ ‘ If we look,’ he says, ‘ to the question upon mere principle, without reference to authority, it is difficult to escape from the conclusion that a loss by a peril insuréd against, and occasioned by negligence, is a loss within a marine policy, unless there be some other language in it which repels that conclusion.
