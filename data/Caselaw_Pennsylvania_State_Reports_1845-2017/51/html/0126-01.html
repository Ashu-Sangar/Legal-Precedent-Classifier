It has parties to it, agreeing to contract with each other, and considerations which are legitimate in themselves, either one of which would suffice to rest a grant upon ; and if the one which binds the son to reside with and labour for his father is not executed, it is open to enforcement. Then again, the language used for the passing of the land is that of a grantor and not of a devisor, while that which creates the covenant of warranty is foreign to that of a will, though peculiar to grantors and deeds of conveyance. To say then that this is a will, is to confound all distinctions between words and language which serve to make one, and those which go to make a deed. The sentence, ‘ and this conveyance in no way to take effect till after the decease of the grantor,’ if taken according to its very letter, would go far towards making the deed inoperative ; while it would also force the conclusion that the parties to it were ignorant of what they were doing, or what they wished to accomplish. Ordinary charity for men’s actions would not permit this, nor will the law presume it. The relations the parties held to each other, and the mutual covenants entered into by them, forbid a conclusion of this kind. The meaning to be given to this sentence, taken in connection with other parts of the deed, is that the deed and the grant it makes, are not to interfere, ‘ <em>in any </em>way,’ with the grantor’s reserved or excepted life estate. Nothing more can be drawn from the sentence than this, and with this it must be satisfied.</p>

Scott, and this is a second ejectment brought by them to regain the possession. If the deed of 22d November 1849 vested the title in John W-. Scott, the subsequent will was inoperative of course, so far as concerned this land; but if the deed vested no present interest, and was intended to operate as a testament, it was very expressly revoked and repealed by the subsequent will, and plaintiff's as devisees under this will have the title.</p>

When he made the instrument he called it an indenture, and permitted his son to record it as a deed. His treatment of it as a will therefore proves nothing. But what is the effect of the reservation clause above quoted ? Undoubtedly, a life estate was reserved to the grantor with the entire use and possession of the premises, and of course the instrument could not take effect as a <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>“ <em>conveyance” </em>until after his death, and such was the declared intention. The learned judge construed the latter clause of the reservation as a protection of the life estate, but it needed no protection for it remained in the grantor, being excepted out of the grant as fully as it was capable of existing. Rut if these pregnant words were added with some such mistaken -notion of the parties, and it is quite possible they were, they are an emphatic declaration that no interest should be considered as presently conveyed to interfere with the life estate, whilst the <em>habendum </em>is equally express that the estate intended to be conveyed to John W. Scott should commence at the death of the grantor. Without straining or unduly emphasizing any of these words, it is impossible to doubt, that if any effect whatever is to be given to them, they limited the fee to take effect <em>in futuro. </em>At common law this can only be done when a particular estate, to take effect presently, is <em>granted, </em>not <em>reserved, </em>to support the fee. If the question was upon John W. Scott’s title under the deed, without any subsequent will in the case, and we should be obliged to say that as an attempt to create a freehold <em>in futuro </em>without the grant of a particular estate to support it, the deed was-void, we might, perhaps, support it as a covenant to stand seised to his use. I say <em>perhaps, </em>because the case has not been fully considered in that aspect, and the reason why we do not so contemplate it is, that there being a subsequent will it becomes a mere question of interpretation, whether the former instrument was testamentary in its character or not. If it was testamentary, then it ought not to be construed as a covenant to stand seised, there being a later will. Had there been no later will, the deed though testamentary might perhaps have been supported as such a covenant. We come then to the real question, was the deed essentially a testamentary instrument.</p>

And because some there be who do censure this excellent definition to he defective, though unworthily,” he makes a full exposition of the meaning of every word in the definition. The only distinction he makes between a testament and a will is the distinction between <em>justa sententia, </em>and <em>legitima dispositio. </em>But the essence of both is that it is a disposition to take effect after death, and this is adopted by Judge Redfield, the latest commentator, in his work on the Law of Wills, p. 5.</p>

Jr. 204, the question was, whether two instruments, one in form a will and the other in form a deed, did not together constitute a will, and the case was greatly considered. It was first argued before Lord Thurlow, who took a long time to consider of it and then directed a case to he stated for the opinion of the Court of King’s Bench. <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>In consequence of too short a statement in sending this ease to law, the second instrument was there considered a deed, and the other questions were ruled accordingly. Afterwards when the case came before Lord Chancellor Loughborough, he said he felt so strongly that this instrument (the deed) was to be construed as testamentary, that he must have the assistance of two of the judges to sit with him at the argument; and accordingly Mr. Justice Buller and Mr. Justice Wilson, in accordance with a custom which sometimes is practised in the Pligh Court of Chancery, sat with the Chancellor and delivered separate, though concurring opinions. Mr. Justice Buller, in his opinion, said: “ When this case was argued in the King’s Bench, no one of the cases quoted here by the attorney-general was mentioned or alluded to. I freely confess,” he added, “they did not occur to me. But those cases have established that an instrument in any form, whether a deed-poll or indenture, if the obvious purpose is not to take place till after the death of the person making it, shall operate as a will. The cases for that are both at law and in equity, and in one of them there were express words of immediate grant and a consideration to support it as a grant, but as upon the whole the intention was that it should have a future operation after death, it was considered as a will.” To the same effect were the other opinions in this case. The cases to which Justice Buller alluded as cited by the attorney-general (Sir John Scott) were West’s Case, Moore 177, where it is laid down that if there is a letter expressing the disposition as to land, it is sufficient; Greene <em>v. </em>Proude, 1 Mod. 117, where, though the instrument was sealed and delivered as a deed, it was held to be a will; Metham <em>v. </em>The Duke of Devonshire, 1 P. Wms. 629, where a will directed the executors to pay 3000Z. as the testator should afterwards appoint. He afterwards made a deed of appointment, which was taken as part of the will.</p>

But it is supposed the covenant of general warranty in the deed estops the plaintiffs. Undoubtedly the covenant of warranty protects the consideration, and as that was in the form of services to be rendered, John W. Scott will be entitled to his action for damages, <em>if he rendered these services. </em>This question has not been investigated in the present action; but if the old man turned the son out of possession of the premises and took exclusive possession to himself, and died 'in such exclusive possession, it is not very likely that a breach of covenant will be enforced against his personal representatives, which was not thought worth asserting against the old man himself.</p>

As these words were expressly limited to take effect only after the death of the grantor, they were necessarily revocable words. The doctrine of the cases is, that whatever the form of the instrument, if it vest no present interest but only appoints what is to be done after the death of the makér, it is a testamentary instrument. It signifies nothing that the parties meant to make a deed instead of a will. If they have used language which the law holds to he testamentary, their intention is to be gathered from the legal import of the words they have employed, for all parties must be judged by the legal meaning of their words.</p>
