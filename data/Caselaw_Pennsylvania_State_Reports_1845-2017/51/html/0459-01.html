      <em>“ </em>It is held in Reed <em>v. </em>Garvin, 12 S. &amp; R. 100, that a guaranty given by the assignor of a bond runs with it into whose hands soever it may come. This rule would be conclusive in favour of the plaintiff, were it not that the representatives of Nace became the owners of the mortgagé, and consequently of the guaranty which was accessory of it. Was the liability of Nace’s estate extinguished by this operation, or only suspended ? The mortgage was not paid. Its acquisition was by purchase. There was no satisfaction of the principal debt, nor was it intended there should be. The case seems to stand nearly on the same footing as when the surety in a bond takes it by assignment and afterwards transfers it to a third person. While he holds the bond his own liability is suspended, but if he parts with the bond, his liability becomes fully revived. The only difference is, in one case the surety is a party in the principal obligation; in the other, he is bound by a covenant collateral to it. But unless the principal debt be paid, or the guarantor be released by some act of the holder of the security amounting to an equitable defence, which is not alleged in the case stated, it is not perceived why the covenant does not still hold, especially as the breach did not occur until after the aásignment by the administrators. The only ground, then, upon which the defendants can claim to stand, is, that the covenant was extinguished by operation of law. But if this were so, the same result must take place when the surety is bound by the principal obligation, which cannot be pretended.</p>

By these, the idea of payment, satisfaction, extinguishment or release is negatived, for there is no exception in the assignment of the mortgage. It includes ‘ all rights, remedies, incidents and appurtenance^ thereunto belonging.’ The mortgage, therefore, seems to have passed into the hands of Schonley as it had been delivered by Hager. All Hager’s rights were transferred to the administrators and their assignees, and Schonley became their assignee. Schonley had recourse to Hager’s name as the legal party. Hager had given his guaranty to Mr. Dubois, but by it the former’s responsibility does not arise until after that of Nace, and hence Hager was exempted from liability to him, and there can be no question to the use of Hager’s name as plaintiff.”</p>

The meaning of the contract must be found in the words of the instrument: Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20243" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Wright 243">10 Wright 243</a>. The guarantor in this case would not be liable on the insolvency merely of the mortgagor, but must resort to the land. It was never ascertained, therefore, that there was a liability till after Nace’s death. And if a right to sue did not exist till after Nace’s death, there could be no merger : no right of action existed at the assignment to Schonley. Merger-is where estates of higher and inferior degrees meet, or where the particular estate and reversion meet in the same person: 4 Kent’s Com. 100. In encumbrances it depends upon intention. Here there was not a conjunction of the whole of two interests in one person, or in the same right, which is indispensable for a merger: Wallace <em>v. </em>Blair, <a href="/grant/1/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Grant 75" data-case-ids="225891" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0075-01">1 Grant 75</a>; Dougherty <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/watts/5/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Watts 456" data-case-ids="1844035" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0456-01">5 Watts 456</a>. Hager’s guaranty was transferred, and it was not extinguished. Hager’s liability only arose finally on Nace’s inability to pay. Can the administrators cast the liability on Hager by refusing to pay out of Nace’s estate ? Hager is the legal plaintiff; his rights attached before the assignment to the administrators. If Schonley cannot recover from Nace’s estate, Hager is liable. The assignment was made to defendants as administrators: they had no <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>right to bind the estate to others, nor others to the estate: describing them as administrators was surplusage.

Nace with Samuel Hager, of the 12th January 1859, the same not having been recoverable from William Spink since the date of said assignment. It is therefore an action on the covenant and undertaking of the decedent in his lifetime, and not upon that of the administrator personally, and this is important to be borne in mind in this case. The covenant of the intestate Nace, now sued upon, Aras a guarantee to Hager, his assignee of the mortgage, against Spink, of a recovery of the mortgage-money. No doubt the property pledged Avas an insufficient security for the money, and it is admitted that the mortgagee was at the time insolvent, so that nothing could be recovered from the land, hence the guarantee required and given. After this, Hager transferred the mortgage to Dubois, and guaranteed a recovery of the money from Spink or Nace, his assignee. Dubois recovered judgment against Spink on the mortgage in 1860, but not the money, and on the 1st of July 1863 he transferred the mortgage and bond to Fluck and Delp, the administrators of Charles Z. Nace, deceased, without any guaranty to pay in case of failure to recover from Spink, and the judgment obtained was marked to the same use. Thus Ave trace into the hands of Nace’s administrators his covenant of guaranty, on which he Avas liable by reason of the admitted insolvency of Spink, and the knOAA’n insufficiency of the estate pledged, for it was afterAvards sold at sheriff’s sale for $100. That it was knoAvn to be insufficient may be inferred from the guarantees as well as the sale.</p>
    <p id="b463-8" data-blocks='[["BL_463.10",463,[188,2053,1169,215]]]'>As the assignment of Dubois was to the administrators of Nace, and not to them personally, Ave must infer, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the consideration was paid by the estate.

It Avas extinguished; and AYhile it remained so was satisfied <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>in law. The mortgage to which it was attached, by the transaction, became the property of the estate, and it cannot be pretended, while it so belonged, that the guaranty was in force. That would be like one guaranteeing an obligation belonging to himself. It was a species of merger, but more properly an extinguishment. Being extinguished, was it revived by the transfer of the administrators? That could not be. They had no authority to create or incur such an obligation against the estate. If they undertook to do so, the obligation would be' their own and not that of the decedent: 8 S. &amp; R. 403; 10 Mod. 316; 3 Bac. M. 94, tit. <em>Executors and Administrators </em>(4 vol., Bouvier’s ed., p. 120); <a href="/dall/1/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Dall. 347" data-case-ids="12146791,12146840,1408525,1408593" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0347-01,/dall/1/0347-02,/us/1/0363-01,/us/1/0364-01">1 Dall. 347</a>, in note. But it is the obligation of the decedent that is sued on, and thus on plain principles the case fails. I do not mean to say that in equity a lien or judgment, might not be kept intact against, an estate after a purchase of it by executors or administrators, where it would manifestly subserve the interest of the estate. Possibly it might be so: but it never could be so to its prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[265,1175,1167,950]]]'>Mr. Schonley dealt with the administrators as such, and was bound to know the legal scope of their powers. They were but the agents of the law for a special purpose, and he could not have been misled by their act. The assignment of the mortgage was all right, and if the administrators had entered into a guarantee for its collection, it would have been their own personal contract, upon which they might have been made responsible as already said. Indeed their assignment contains nothing, in my opinion, like a guarantee by themselves or for the estate. They assign the mortgage, “ together with all rights, remedies, incidents and appurtenances, whatsoever thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and all our estate, right, title, interest, property, claim and demand whatsoever of, in and to, the same, to hold,” &amp;c. There is nothing in these terms to revive an extinct liability or create a new one. No doubt, had they stood in the relation of strangers to the estate, such a transfer would have passed the collateral covenant of guaranty, for then it would have been in full force and vigour. Not so as the case stands. It was extinct, and what the administrators said in the instrument of transfer did not revive it. We think the court below erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff below, and that it must be reversed and judgment entered the other way.</p>
