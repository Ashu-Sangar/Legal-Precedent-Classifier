    <p class="summary" id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.7",88,[282,852,1161,1113]]]'>“ The plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for consequential damages — such as danger from sparks from the chimneys of the locomotives falling on the buildings and endangering their safety, from smoke and cinders from the same source, or the raising of dust by the motion and movement of the cars, and their entering into the house or distillery. It is not easy to see what the measure or standard of compensation for one or the other would be. If allowance should be made for a liability of fire, and none should occur, it would be gain to one without advantage to the other. Smoke, cinders, and dust might be an annoyance, but form no part of an allowable claim. The same may be said of the danger of horses becoming affrighted and thus making it somewrkat more difficult to carry freight to and from the distillery; and also of the horse at the mesh-tub becoming frightened at the rumbling of the trains so that the work had to be done by hand. The probability, too, that the company may, some time hereafter, fill the ravine over which the trestle-work is constructed, and thus destroy the spring of water, is not an item of consideration. The road, we are told by the engineer, is complete as it now stands, and injuries to the plaintiff’s rights as they exist from this state of things, are alone to be considered. If alterations hereafter occur, by which these injuries are increased, it will he time enough to consider them then, and we need not anticipate them. If the spring or spring-house has been interfered with in any way, to the prejudice of the plaintiff, or if his customary access to them has been obstructed, he is to be made good therefor.</p>

The distillery remains as it was and has been, and there is access to and from it, under the trestle-work; but whether this is of equal extent, or as safe as it previously was, is for the jury to determine — and if it is not, a fair and reasonable compensation is to be made therefor. In determining the case, with a view to a just conclusion, the jury will consider what the fair marketable value of the entire premises was before and after the road was built. If it was as much after its completion as it <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>was before, the plaintiff has sustained no loss — or, in other words, if the advantages arising from the road, when built, are equal to the disadvantages to the premises, the one is to be considered an equivalent for the other.</p>

In estimating the disadvantages resulting from the road, consequential or speculative damages are to be rejected, and in estimating the advantages, such only as are special and peculiar to the property in question are to be considered, and not such as are common to the public. It is the business of the viewers in the first instance, and on appeal, of the jury, to balance the advantages that are special against the disadvantages that are actual, and with the aid of whatever testimony is laid before them, to find out as well as they can how much less the land would fetch in market by reason of the road, and that sum, which will represent what has really been taken away from the owner, should be given back in damages. All the particulars complained of in this case by the plaintiff in error were no doubt considered by the witnesses and the jury, and under the direction given we must regard the verdict for $567.50 as expressive of the full extent to wliich the plaintiff had been injured.</p>
