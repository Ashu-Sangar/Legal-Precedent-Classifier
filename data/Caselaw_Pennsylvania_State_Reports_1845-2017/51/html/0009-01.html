The association also raised a considerable amount, by subscription, from citizens not subject to military duty. Many volunteers were obtained, to whom bounty was paid. Eventually a sufficient number had not been put in, according to the computation made by the provost-marshal., and a few were drafted. They were relieved by the society paying -the commutation fixed by law. A second call was made by the President for 500,000 more soldiehs, and the number to be supplied by Halifax township was again fixed by the United States officers, and all raised according to the computation, by paying large bounties to volunteers. This was not finally effected until the 7th day of September 1864. Subsequently, on the 26th day of the same month, a new estimate was made by the government officers, and it was ascertained that this township had put into the service thirteen more men than filled its quota. The first announcement intimating a. liability on the part of Halifax township at large to repay the money advanced by the association was at the meeting on the 21st of July 1864, and the first clear and unequivocal resolution, declaring that it should be a debt of the township, was on the 28th day of the same month. Very much of the money now asked to be refunded had been expended by -the Bounty Association before that time. On the 25th day of August following, the act was passed which mainly gives rise to the present controversy. By that act the school directors of Halifax township are authorized and required to borrow so much money as will fully reimburse the Halifax Bounty Association <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>the money advanced to free the said township from the draft of 700,000 men; also, such sum as will- be required to free said township from the present call for 500,000 men; and, in order to repay the money, they are authorized to levy and.collect a tax, or taxes, for the full amount, with interest, during the same year, or run the loan and collection through a period not exceeding five years.</p>

Suppose that there were ten or even twenty citizens outside of the association who Avere subject to military duty, was not the <em>substantial object </em>to free the township from the draft ?

It has been held that no mere misnomer in the name of a person or corporation mentioned in an Act of Congress is fatal to its validity, if the person or corporation really intended can be collected from the terms of the statute : 3 Sumner 279.

The tax-payers of the township have, to a great extent, had the benefit of that <em>advance, </em>and could, under the Act of the 25th of March 1864 — a law passed soon after this society was formed, and before its money was raised — have been obliged, by the imposition of taxes, to have paid the whole bounty-money.

It was a voluntary payment, which could not be recovered, but the legislature gave a remedy by requiring the school directors, as representatives of the township, to refund the money and charge it on the general property. I am well satisfied that the legislature could not <em>require it; </em>that it transcended their power. But if the corporate authorities of the township choose to accept the loan and perform the duty, I know of no power in the citizens or the court to restrain them. The school board is, for this purpose, made the representative of the township, both by the general law on the subject of bounties and -the special act relating to this township ; and although created and elected for a different object, yet they, as well as any other corporate body, or set of township officers, may be designated to represent the municipality in this particular.

It never was the intention of the people in framing that instrument to prohibit a municipality from -paying its honest debts or performing its moral or legal duties. It is denied that this was a debt or moral duty of the township. It was no <em>debt, </em>in legal acceptation, so far as concerns this bounty association; but if the money was advanced in" relief of the township, which could have been lawfully collected off the property of the citizens, and this association voluntarily paid it, from selfish motives we may assume, would there not be a moral obligation on the part of the , citizens to refund ? If such is the case, it can in no sense be said that the law has authorized the township “ to <em>obtain money </em>for an association or party.” In construing, these words we must-look at the evil which it was designed to guard against. Those municipalities had lent their credit to various railroad companies and other corporations to such an extent as seriously to burden and impair the value of the property situated within them. The state had also suffered in its own treasury from the same course of proceeding, and1 it was resolved that the evil should not again recur; and hence such laws were prohibited by these amendments to the constitution. This case does not come within the spirit or intention of the prohibition.</p>

It is proposed to pay, by a tax on the citizens, for thirteen volunteer soldiers put into the service more than was required for the full quota of Halifax township. This is to be regretted ; but it arose from a mistake, not of the township officers or the bounty association, but of those intrusted with the performance of the duties ■ by the United States. It appears that several changes occurred, from time to time, as to the number of men required from this township. Every effort was made by the citizens to have the number reduced or the errors corrected. It was not <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>done, and a draft was apparently inevitable. The volunteers were then procured, and the bounty paid. Every man was put into the service and received his bounty by the 7th of September, and the error was not corrected until the 26th day of that month. When discovered the men could not be recalled, nor could the bounty be restored. It is one of those cases where the present respondents were in no default. The Act of Assembly, requiring the money to be refunded, or paid out in bounties, was passed on the 25th of August, and all then due was required to be paid to the association, and the draft about to be made provided against. Under such circumstances we are not prepared to say that the tax is illegal. If a loss is to be borne it is more fair to throw it on the township at large than upon individuals, or officers who are in no default. If the people are obliged to pay some additional tax on account of this error, they will’ at least have the consolation of knowing that the men they procured are in the service of the country, and also that, in case of another draft, which now appears imminent, they will be entitled to a credit of thirteen men in the beginning.</p>

It is left to the discretion of the school board, and although we may consider it an abuse of that discretion, and an impolitic and unjust, course towards the tax-payer, yet we have no control, and cannot forbid these gentlemen from pursuing and carrying out the law of the land. Eor aught we know, a large majority of the citizens may desire that course to be pursued, and prefer meeting the burden at once.</p>

But the learned judge, if I properly comprehend his meaning, did not give sufficient importance to these terms, and hence I apprehend he fell into error.

The legislature can exercise no such despotic functions, and as it is not apparent in the act that they attempted to do so, we are not to presume they did.
