      <em>“ </em>Having thus fixed the date of the delivery of the deed, it becomes important to determine the effect of entering the Buchanan and Hughes judgments, on the same day with the deed. The evidence does not show what hour of the day these judgments were entered, hut the counsel argued that they became liens on the land of the grantor from the first hour of the day. Our Supreme Court has decided that the rule of the common law, which rejects fractions of a day in determining the priority of liens, is restricted to judgments, and in a case similar, to this the court say it would he impossible to put a judgment and a conveyance on a footing of equality, not only because it would be impracticable to determine the relative .proportions coming to each, but because they are inconsistent and irreconcilable. <em>“ </em>The one,” says Gibson, O. J., “ is a security which encumbers the property in exclusion of everything subsequent to it; the other, a conveyance excluding everything to which it is anterior; and they are, therefore, incapable of standing together. To affect land in the hands of a purchaser a judgment must have been not merely simultaneous with, but anterior to the conveyance; and, as an indispensable measure of justice, the precise time at which the judgment was entered must be shown by less than record proof.” “ The argument,” says the learned judge, “ that a judgment wdiose date, in contemplation of law, covers the whole day, is necessarily anterior to a conveyance at an intermediate point of the same day, is too subtle to be solid;” and in concluding his argument the chief justice says, <em>“ </em>When judgments hear the same date they must necessarily come in together, but between a judgment and a conveyance, actual priority must be shown like any other fact:” Mechanics’ Bank <em>v. </em>Gorman, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 304" data-case-ids="483285" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0304-01">8 W. &amp; S. 304</a>.</p>

Were it a. question between lien-creditors only it might be readily solved, by letting them share <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>in the fund <em>pro rata, </em>on the ground that a day has no fractions in legal proceedings. But here the claims of the parties conflict not only in time but nature, and are so irreconcilable one must give way to the other ; and the question is, what principle must govern the precedence ? A lien is but a encumbrance on title, but a conveyance passes the title away. If, therefore, the judgment be prior, the conveyance is subject to it; if posterior it has no lien, because the title is gone. In principle the case falls clearly within the decision in Mechanics’ Bank <em>v. </em>Gorman, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 304" data-case-ids="483285" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0304-01">8 W. &amp; S. 304</a>, Claason’s Appeal, 10 Harris 363, and like cases, admitting proof of the hour at which each transaction took place. But no proof was excluded, and the difficulty arises not from a denial of the right to give it, but from the inability to furnish it. We are then driven to the necessity of determining the rights of the parties upon the presumption which the law must afford us. In point of fact the judgment may have been prior, it would therefore be unjust to postpone it from mere considerations of equality in the distribution. It may have been subsequent, and it would be improper to give it undue precedence. It must, therefore, be determined upon just legal principles, and those reasons which best promote the general interests.</p>

It is firmly established, and is not to yield, unless to the certain demands of justice. Starting with this principle the lien of the judgment, which begins with the day itself, necessarily antedates the conveyance. In this respect there is no distinction between judgments by confession, and those actually pronounced by the courts. It is easily to be seen, that in the case of adversary judgments they might be often defeated by the fraud of defendants, who on the same day could place assignments for creditors on record, unless the legal presumption be maintained. Indeed, at common law the judgment related back to the first day of the term, and it required the passage of the Act of 1772 to confine its operation to the day on which it was signed, in favour of <em>bond fide </em>purchasers for a valuable consideration.</p>
