Judgments were recovered against the same two by three other creditors, after his death. The heirs sold the land by private sale; and, in order to save the expense of judicial proceedings and to relieve the two shares from the lien of their judgments, the three creditors and the two heirs agreed that the purchase-money should go into the hands of a third person, to be applied by him to the payment of their judgments “as far as their shares of purchase-money may liquidate the same in the order of, and according to, their respective legal priorities, and not <em>pro rata.” Held, </em>the debt of the two heirs to the intestate could not be taken out of the proceeds of sale, before the payment of the judgment-creditors.</p>

Administration was granted to William H. Wallace. The decedent left six children, viz., the above-named Katharine, Sallie, Henry, Benjamin, George and Francis, but left no widow. At the death of their father, George and Francis (with one E. S. Schively, the three composing the firm of Keysers &amp; Schively), were indebted to their father on a judgment obtained in 1858; on which there remained due, after deducting their shares in their father’s personal estate, $9484.73. After the decedent’s death Malone and Taylor obtained a judgment against Keysers &amp; Schively, which, being reduced to $618.01, was assigned to said W. H. Wallace. W. C. Lloyd also obtained a judgment against the same firm for $3904.03, and Maria Schively obtained a judgment against the same firm for $3000. The heirs having an opportunity to sell the real estate of the decedent, and all the parties being desirous to save the expense of judicial proceedings, and to sell it free from the liens on the shares of George and Francis, by agreements in writing, reciting that the judgments of Wallace, Lloyd and Maria Schively were liens on the shares of George and Francis, but not referring to the judgment of their father, stipulated, <em>“ </em>that the said George F.

Lloyd thereupon brought suit against Wallace to recover the amount of his judgment out of the shares of George and Francis in said proceeds. The bill, setting forth the. facts, and averring, among other things, that the shares of George and Francis are only so much of their father’s estate as may remain after the payment of their indebtedness to him, was brought by the heirs of the decedent to restrain Lloyd from prosecuting his suit, and praying that Wallace may be decreed to pay to the heirs the proceeds of the sale, and for general relief. Wallace, the defendant, answered that he had always been ready to pay to the heirs their shares of the real estate, but the heirs allege that they are entitled to the whole proceeds ; and Lloyd alleges that his judgment, by virtue of the agreement, should be paid out of the shares of George and Francis, and he is advised that he cannot safely distribute the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>fund until the rights of the claimants are judicially determined. Lloyd, another defendant, answered that the complainants are not proper parties to this bill, the administrator of E. W. Keyser being the proper person to recover a debt due the estate, and the debt is not a lien on their estate, and they negative the claim as an advancement, because they aver that it originated in a loan by the decedent. He denied that the shares of George and Francis were only what remained of their father’s estate after paying their debt due him, and insisted that his judgment being a lien was prior to the claim of the estate, that the debt due the father was not a lien on the after-acquired property of George and Francis, and that by virtue of the agreement as to the sale of the property the judgments were to be paid according to priority of lien. The other defendants, Maria Schively, George F. Keyser and Francis Keyser, answered, submitting themselves to the court on the facts in the bill. A general replication was filed and proofs were taken. Upon argument, Read, J., delivered the following opinion:—</p>

By the Intestate Act the realty descends in fixed proportions, subject to no diminution of quantity, except by advancement or settlement; and this only by a legal retrospect, constituting it a present portion of the entire estate. It makes no difference whether the advancement was in land or money, but the law founds itself on the intention of the ancestor, making it a present portion of his descend-able estate in advance of his death.

Springer’s Appeal, 5 Casey 208, was also a case of distribution; and the expression of Lowrie, J., that in distribution the debt of an heir may be treated as an advancement, had reference to the fact as found in the court below, and not to the question now before us. There is nothing in the 16th section of the intestate laws countenancing the idea of deduction, except by way of advancement or settlement.</p>
