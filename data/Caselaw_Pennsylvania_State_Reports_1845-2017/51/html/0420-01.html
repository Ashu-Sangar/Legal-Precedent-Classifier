The widow and children came to an agreement to sell the land in her lifetime; and, in consideration of her joining in a deed to the defendant, she was to receive <em>the interest </em>of ¿61000 during her life, The objection is that the interest is payable <em>yearly, </em>but I apprehend that, in equity, in a <em>contract </em>like this, the <em>interest acames from, day to day. </em>Considering the <em>circumstances </em>and <em>family agreement </em>in in this case, to which <em>the defendant was a party, </em>it was a provision for the widow, for which she paid a valuable consideration.” She conveyed (the land) to the defendant, and he enjoyed an estate -in the land during her life, for.which he agreed to pay the interest of ¿61000.</p>
