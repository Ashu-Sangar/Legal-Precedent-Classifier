The certificate of the justice was regular and showed an acknowledgment in accordance with the Act of Assembly. The defence was by the wife.</p>

She said she did- not like to; this was on the same day it was signed. McCandless and Evans were out at the barn at the time. Father said she must do it; she said she would if she had to ; she cried about it. At several times during the day, before that, he wanted her; she still said she did not like to do it. It was not long after she refused and he said she must sign it, till McCandless and Evans came in. I saw her sign it. Mr. Patterson, McCandless, Evans and myself were present, and my father, all in one room, when she signed it. Cannot remember whether the mortgage was read. Father was present all the time it was being acknowledged before Squire Patterson. Father told mother, if McCandless asked her anything about it she should not say anything. I don’t know of her being out of the room till McCandless and Evans eame in. She was sick at the time. She was just able to walk about, and that was about all. The mortgage was for father’s debt. I still got goods from the store on father’s order. It was a store account. McCandless kept a- store in Greenville. Don’t know of anything else in the mortgage. It was not long, some days before, father was importuning her to sign it.”</p>

They told me that a mortgage was to be executed; I inquired whether it had been read, or its contents made known; several of them answered that they all understood it. I requested Mr. Evans to read the particular parts of it, as I then supposed he had filled <em>it; </em>he did so. I said, as they had been waiting a long time for me, we would make haste and fix the matter up. I told them if the parties were agreed, it was ready for their signatures. It was on the table. Mr. and Mrs. Engle came forward to the table together, Engle a little in advance. Mr. Engle put his name to it and stepped back behind the chair I was sitting on; I thought he had left the house. Mrs. Engle said she did not know whether she could write her name or not. I told her if she was willing to sign her name of her own accord to make the attempt, and if she could not write it, some one of us would write it for her. She took the pen and wrote her name — very willingly and very freely as I thought. I watched to see whether I could see any unwillingness on her part, but could see none. There was a good deal of hilarity and good humour. She appeared to be in a very good humour. Engle was some distance back when I spoke to her. I thought he was going into the room adjoining.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b311-7" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[197,1448,1157,129]]]'>“ But in the present case the defence is made by the wife alone, who claims the right in herself, and the only question is whether she has executed this mortgage in accordance with the rules of law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b311-8" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[195,1577,1160,472]]]'>She signed the mortgage in the presence of competent witnesses, and acknowledged it before a proper officer. That certificate is in due form and contains all that is requisite to give it validity. The rule in such a case is that an innocent purchaser of a mortgage or a title, who pays his money on the faith of a regular deed, properly executed and acknowledged, takes the deed discharged of any secret imperfections not apparent on the face of the instrument. In other words the certificate is not only <em>primd facie </em>but conclusive in the hands of an innocent and <em>bond fide </em>holder, who did not participate in any management or fraud or coercion, and who had no notice of it.</p>

His evidence is <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>attacked, and the jury will judge of its truth. If he is believed, the husband requested her to sign it. She said she did not like to ; he said she must, when she cried and said if she must she would, and he told her not to object when they asked her about it. To set aside a deed on such ground there must he a legal or moral constraint of the wife’s will by the husband. He has a right to induce her by reasonable persuasion, hut not to constrain or force her. If he procures it to he done against her free will by compulsion, or by moral or by legal constraint, it was void, if the mortgagee knew it. If, however, there was no such constraint as to overcome her free will, but she was induced merely by persuasion, and executed it freely and voluntarily, it was available to make the deed good; and if McCandless did not know of any coercion, he would not he affected.</p>

The law requires that the wife’s examination should be separate and apart from her husband; and it is said that instead of such being the case, he was present in the room, and within hearing distance, in other words, that he was actually present; and that McCandless was present and knew it. This is a question of fact for the jury. If you believe the husband was present in the room, within hearing distance, where his gestures or countenance could be seen, and when by such means he might influence her, the mortgage, as to her, would be void. It was the duty of the justice to see that all the requisites of the law were complied with; and to see that the examination was separate and apart, and it was also the duty of the mortgagee if he was present.</p>

Why did she delay so long to have the mortgage cancelled, if invalid ? She should not be successful, if she and her husband combined that she should manifest no unwillingness.

My brother Woodward, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said, “ In cases of fraud and imposition, or duress, parol evidence has been freely admitted to overthrow the certificate (of acknowledgment), as in Schrader <em>v. </em>Decker, 9 Barr 14; Louden <em>v. </em>Blythe, 4 Harris 532; Same <em>v. </em>Same, 3 Casey 25 ;” to which I may add Daily <em>v. </em>Foster, 2 Wall. U. S. Rep. 24: “ And where fraud and duress has been practised in obtaining the acknowledgment, and the knowledge of it has been brought home to the grantee, or of such circumstances as would lead him to inquire upon the point,” it will avoid it.</p>

It is enough if it be shown that the wife <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>did it under moral constraint; that is, by threats, persecution and harshness of her husband to force her to set aside her own free will, and comply unwillingly with his wishes. To bind her she must be examined separate and apart from her husband, and then and there declare that her execution of the instrument is of “ her own free will and accord, and without any coercion or compulsion on the part of her said husband.” Whenever her acknowledgment is procured in violation and disregard of these absolute requirements, it is void, and this may be shown, as the cases cited above establish, by parol proof.</p>
    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[288,830,1151,472]]]'>If there ever was a case of coercion within the meaning of the statute, it was here. Not only was this known to the mortgagee, but no opportunity was afforded the wife to escape it, for the husband was permitted to be present, where he could see and hear every indication of unwillingness on her part to execute or acknowledge the mortgage. The magistrate under the circumstances certified to two misstatements, each destructive of the object of the law in providing for the separate examination of married women. The court was entirely right in admitting the testimony to establish these facts, and in allowing to them the effect of invalidating the acknowledgment, if believed by the jury.</p>
    <p id="b314-7" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[281,1300,1154,642]]]'>The case of Michener 'and Wife <em>v. </em>Cavender also settles the other point of the case, namely, whether the assignee of the mortgage is to be effected by the facts invalidating the acknowledgment. It is settled in that case that it was his duty to have inquired of the mortgagors if there was any defence to the mortgage, and failing to do so, took the risk on himself of such a defence, as well as any other which the mortgagors might legally or equitably have. We see no reason why the rule is not as applicable to this species of defence as any other allegation of want of due execution; and holding that, the assignee who is the equitable plaintiff here, failing to observe the precaution, cannot complain of want of notice of the defect in executing the mortgage. A different rule applies to conveyances of real estate. A mortgage is only so, however, in form, while in fact it is but a security for money.</p>
