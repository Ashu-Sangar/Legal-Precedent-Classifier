The- estate left by John Evans consisted, almost exclusively, of the farm upon which he died. The widow undertook to continue the farming business, and thus keep the family together, and their support was wholly derived from that source. Peter Evans, being the only .child old enough for the purpose, was employed by the widow and guardian as the business-man and farmer, and continued in that position until the trial of this suit, purchasing, with his guardian’s consent, all the stock, farming implements, &amp;c., and selling and disposing of the crops and products of the farm.</p>

The guardian took charge of them, and directed where they should be put, making no objection, but receiving them with full knowledge of her ward’s pur-" chase. The cattle were used upon the place for some time, and then traded -for a horse, which continued to do the work of the farm. No objection was ever made to the transaction until Mr. Mohney called for his money, upwards of a year after the purchase, when the guardian and ward both refused to pay the money or restore the property.</p>

Yet doubtless the court may, in many cases, pronounce authoritatively on the question and withhold it from the jury. If this defendant had been, at seventeen years of age, a school-boy, or an apprentice learning a trade, a judge would have been quite justifiable in pronouncing his purchase of a pair of bulls an invalid contract, but when we learn that he was carrying on a farm for his widowed mother, who had been appointed his legal guardian and with whom he lived — that she permitted the bulls to be received upon the farm — that her son was in the habit of selling the products of the farm and of making purchases ; and that he exchanged the bulls for a horse that was used in working the farm, it is not, in view of such circumstances, so clear that the purchase was invalid, and the question whether it was a necessary purchase ought to have been submitted to the jury.</p>

There is a single expression near the close of the charge which imports a reference of the question whether the bulls were <em>“ </em>needful” to the defendant, but taking the charge altogether, and especially in connection with the answer to the fourth point, it is impossible to say that the question was submitted to the jury. After specifying boarding, clothing, medical attendance, schooling, &amp;c., as necessaries for which minors may contract, the learned judge said: “ This case, perhaps, if the jury believe the weight of evidence, is a fitting example, as this boy purchased a pair of bulls <em>not needed on the farm and at an exorbitant price. </em>” Then he negatived the 4th point, which asked him to say that it was for the jury to decide whether the bulls were necessary under all the circumstances of the case.</p>
