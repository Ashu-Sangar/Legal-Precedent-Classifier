But by the terms of their contract they were bound to deliver one thousand barrels during the month of August, and one thousand barrels during each month thereafter until the whole quantity contracted for should be delivered. On the 1st of December 1862, when the plaintiffs began to purchase oil and charge the defendants with the difference between the contract and the market price, the deficiency for the four preceding months amounted to four thousand barrels. The defendants contend that the plaintiffs were not entitled to purchase the whole amount of the deficiency at the market price of oil in December, and charge them with the difference between the contract and the market prices for the whole quantity deficient, but only for the deficiency of the preceding month of November, viz.: one thousand barrels. It seems to me that they are right in this. The damages are to be measured and estimated as of the time of the breach, and not as of the date of the purchase after so long a delay. The evidence shows that the price of oil was advancing rapidly from October to December, when it attained its maximum. It would not be equitable that the plaintiffs, under such circumstances, should delay from the 1st of September, when they might have begun to purchase the amount of the deficiency for the preceding month, until the 1st of December, and then purchase the whole amount of the deficiency of the four preceding months at the then greatly increased market rates, and charge the defendants with the whole difference.

But there is evidence as to the price of oil in the month of October, and the jury would be justified in allowing the difference between the contract price and the market price in October for the quantity not delivered in September; and so in regard to the oil deliverable during the month of October, the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the difference between the contract and the market price in November, allowing a reasonable time for making the purchase. The defendants do not deny that if they are liable for the non-delivery of the oil, they would be chargeable with the difference between the contract price and the market price in December for the oil deliverable during the month of November.

So Mr. W. Pitt Taylor, in his Treatise on Evidence, vol. i. p. 56, says: — “ So the question whether the sum mentioned in an agreement to be paid for a breach, is to be treated as a penalty, or as liquidated damages, is one of law to be decided by the judge, <em>upon a consideration of the whole </em>instrument.” In Sainter <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 7 Com. Bench 730, Mr. Justice Cresswell said: “If there be only one event, upon which the money was to become payable, and there is no adequate means of ascertaining the precise damage that may result to the plaintiff, from a breach of the contract, it is perfectly competent to the parties to fix a given amount of compensation in order to avoid the difficulty;” and Mr. Justice Williams said: “ I agree with the rest of the court, that it is competent to the parties by mutual agreement to settle the amount of damages that are in their nature uncertain and difficult of estimation, where they depend upon the failure to perform a single act.”</p>
    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[268,1213,1167,471]]]'>There is in this agreement a stipulation entirely incompatible with the idea that the sum named was liquidated damages, for whenever there was a failure to supply, the plaintiff could go into the market and buy and charge the difference, and there is not a word to show that they must stop purchasing when the differences reach the $10,000, and then the contract is at an end, although there may be three or more deliveries to be made ; on the other hand, if all the deliveries were made but the last one thousand barrels, it would be most unreasonable to exact the whole amount when the whole damage might only be a fourth or some other portion of the sum fixed.</p>
