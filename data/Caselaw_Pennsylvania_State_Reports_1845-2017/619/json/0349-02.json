Is Commonwealth Court\u2019s restrictive construction of [the Bituminous Coal Mine Safety Act (\u201cBCMSA\u201d), 52 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 690-101 et seq.,] holding that the lack of specific delegation to the Department [of Environmental Protection] beyond \u201cgeneral enforcement powers\u201d means that DEP cannot issue[ ] orders interpreting the statute it is authorized to administer and enforce, contrary to this Court\u2019s decisions in Pa. Human Relations Commission v. Norristown Area School District, [473 Pa. 334, 374 A.2d 671 (1977) ] and Commonwealth, Department of Environmental Resources v. Butler County Mushroom Farm, 499 Pa. 509, 454 A.2d 1 (1982)?\nb. Is Commonwealth Court\u2019s overly restrictive construction of BCMSA holding that the lack of specific delegation to the Department beyond \u201cgeneral enforcement powers\u201d mean[ ] that DEP cannot issue[ ] orders interpreting the statute it is authorized to administer and enforce contrary to the plain language of both that Act and the General Assembly\u2019s intent in modernizing the Commonwealth\u2019s mine safety laws?\nc. Is Commonwealth Court\u2019s majority holding that the lack of specific delegation to the Department beyond \u201cgeneral enforcement powers\u201d means that DEP cannot issue[ ] orders interpreting the statute it is authorized to administer and enforce, contrary to established administrative law principles[?]\nd. Is the Commonwealth Court Majority\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s authority under BCMSA Section 501 is circumscribed to allow it to issue only orders that enforce the act inconsistent with fundamental principles of statutory construction?",
