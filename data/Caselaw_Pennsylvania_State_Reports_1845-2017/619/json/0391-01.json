The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n1. Did the Commonwealth Court err in interpreting the MPC as authorizing a developer\u2019s Tentative Plan to designate the use of buildings by generic designation only as \u201cresidential\u201d or \u201cnonresidential\u201d so as to effectively negate the MPC\u2019s due process safeguards requiring notice and a public hearing and thereby deny due process to the public and neighboring property owners?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court err in adopting a novel interpretation of MPC Section 707(4)(iv) that has no basis in the law, that conflicts with the meaning of the term \u201cuse\u201d throughout the MPC, and that conflicts with this Court\u2019s decision in Eves v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 401 Pa. 211, 164 A.2d 7 (1960)?",
