The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n(1) Does the City have power to protect its residents from acts of discrimination by SEPTA, a metropolitan transportation authority, where the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act explicitly states that nothing in the PHRA shall be deemed to repeal or supersede any of the antidiscrimination provisions of any municipal ordinance, the City\u2019s power to regulate discrimination is not sourced in the PHRA, the City\u2019s ordinance extends by its terms to SEPTA as an employer and provider of public accommodations, and concurrent state and local jurisdiction would not adversely affect SEPTA\u2019s core transportation mission?\n(2) Should the City\u2019s Commission on Human Relations have been permitted, following the well-established rule of administrative exhaustion, to determine any challenges by SEPTA to its jurisdiction in the first instance, thereby having the opportunity to make findings on a developed factual record suitable for appellate review as to the nexus between the City\u2019s interests and the alleged discrimination, rather than the Commonwealth Court ruling on an abstract, premature challenge?",
