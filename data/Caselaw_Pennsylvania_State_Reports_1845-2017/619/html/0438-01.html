According to Insurer, Section 1797(b)(5) — which does not authorize fee shifting — reflects the appropriate limits on an award by a court on review of a refusal supported by a peer-review determination. <em>See id. </em>at § 1797(b)(5) (“If a PRO determines that medical treatment [was] ... necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12% per year on any amount withheld by the insurer pending PRO review.”).</p>

[Insurer’s] immunity interpretation would, in our opinion, only serve to provide an incentive to all insurers to send all bills to a peer review process in which all semblance of objectivity'could be all but ignored, so long as the insurer’s conduct is not “wanton”, and the provider (or an insured) would be left with the enormous expense of seeking redress in the courts with no possibility of recovering those costs and fees.</blockquote>

Although Provider discusses various of the provisions of Section 1797, its arguments consistently flow into policy statements and explications. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 7 (“1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2) states the presumed intent of the Legislature is that <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>it ‘intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.’ A reading of 1797 in its entirety indicates a public policy to make health care providers whole.”); <em>see also id. </em>(contending that fee awards against insurers inure to the public interest).</p>

Provider, however, suggests that this Court rejected such a reading in <em>Terminato, </em>as a corollary to its holding that an insured may challenge a peer-review determination <em>in court, </em>without a threshold request for reconsideration asserted within the peer-review system. <em>See id. </em>at 10 (“Since § 1797(b)(4) and (6) are the only sections of 1797 that pertain to a[c]ourt’s determination^] then the damages in § 1797(b)(6) must apply.

Accordingly, in the absence of a demonstrated constitutional infirmity, courts generally must apply plain terms of statutes as written; they are to confine efforts to effectuate legislative intent — above and beyond the prescriptions of written laws— to ambiguous provisions; and they are to enforce the longstanding responsibility allocated to the policymaking branch to provide for fee shifting, when it is deemed appropriate, through explicit pronouncements.</p>

Obviously, PROs have a strong financial incentive to appear fair in the eyes of the insurance company. Otherwise, the insurance company will take its business else<a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>where. On the other hand, the PRO is not concerned with how the insured views the PRO because this will not affect its future business. Consequently, the PRO does not have the characteristics of an independent body for which the Legislature would seek judicial deference.</blockquote>

Because we have permitted a direct appeal to the trial court under Section 1797(b), <em>see Terminato, </em>it follows that such an appeal must be real and meaningful, and not illusory, to comport with due process. As explained below, unless the remedies provision of Section 1797(b)(6) is applied following a court determination, the appellate rights granted by the Insurance Commissioner and verified through <em>Terminato </em>will cease to exist for pragmatic purposes, returning the state of the law to where it was before <em>Foster, </em>the Insurance Commissioner’s regulation at 31 Pa.Code 69.52(m), and <em>Terminato, </em>and rendering the statutory scheme unconstitutional under basic due process.</p>

If providers are unable to recover the costs associated with <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>obtaining the payments to which they are due, the courts will be closed to the providers and insureds seeking to recover payment of bills which the insurance company has contracted to pay.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[154,559,1150,482]]]'>The record in this case amply supports this conclusion. Insurers here have engaged in a “scorched earth litigation strategy,” <em>see </em>Appellees’ Brief at 86, where insurance companies demonstrate their willingness to spare no expense to deter providers from pursuing their claims in court, even when the care is reasonable and necessary. As Provider describes, Insurer seeks to intimidate health care providers into either not treating automobile crash victims at all or cutting off their health care prematurely.</p>
    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[154,1084,1153,862]]]'>In the instant case, Provider’s care was judicially determined to be reasonable and necessary. Notwithstanding, they have spent the last ten years, and $27,000 in attorneys’ fees, to recover $1,380.68, which Insurer was contractually, statutorily, and factually obligated to pay. Insurer spent over $40,000 defending against its contractual obligation to pay this bill. The motivation is clear: insurance companies know that if they defend every claim to this extent, providers will quickly be forced to relinquish their right to payment for provided services because the cost of litigation will always outweigh the cost of their services. The insurance industry should not be permitted to deprive providers of their rightful day in court through this strategy, which, again, is amply demonstrated on this record. In short, the due process that the Insurance Commissioner and the case law have granted to the provider community will have been abrogated.</p>

There are two remedies provisions in Section 1797(b): Section 1797(b)(5), which applies when the PRO determines the care was reasonable and necessary and which requires the insurer to pay the outstanding bill plus interest; and Section 1797(b)(6), which applies when the court determines that care was reasonable and necessary and re<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>quires the insurer to pay the outstanding bill, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. Of these two subsections, only Section 1797(b)(6) discusses the participation of a court and counsel. If the court determines the treatment was medically necessary, therefore, the only statutory section regarding court involvement provides that the insurer must pay the outstanding amount, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. Without the attorneys’ fees, the provider will not be made whole and its due process rights will not be accommodated.</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[265,838,1154,632]]]'>On appeal, Insurer recognizes that the statute does not provide for judicial review of PRO determinations. Conceding that judicial review is nevertheless required as a matter of regulation and case law, it argues that the remedies provision that applies following judicial review is Section 1797(b)(5). This section, however, is clearly implicated only where a PRO makes a determination in favor of the insured, and does not account for attorneys’ fees, as attorneys are not involved with peer review. Because counsel is not involved, Section 1797(b)(5) does not capture the reality of the costs associated with a court challenge, and is not applicable to a court determination.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[262,1522,1151,641]]]'>Even with the award of attorneys’ fees following an adverse court determination, insurers will remain incentivized to utilize the peer review process, therefore accommodating the cost-containment goals articulated in the Majority Opinion. Specifically, Section 1797(b)(4) provides for the award of treble damages for wanton conduct. As the lower courts here found, Insurer’s use of the PRO process defeated Provider’s claim for treble damages, as it was indicative of a lack of wanton conduct. To avoid or defeat of claim for treble damages, therefore, Insurers would continue to seek peer review of bills for services which they believe they are not contractually obligated to pay.</p>
