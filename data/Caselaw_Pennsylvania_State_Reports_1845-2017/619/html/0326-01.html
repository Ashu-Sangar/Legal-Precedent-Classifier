In <em>Glen-Gery, </em>we held where lack of notice resulted in deprivation of due process, or where other constitutional rights were implicated, the 30-day time bar for challenging a procedural ordinance was inapplicable. <em>Id., </em>at 1035-37. In response to these decisions, the Legislature amended § 5571.1 to require <em>strict </em>compliance with statutory procedure when an ordinance is challenged within 30 days of its intended effective date, and placed the burden of proof on the challenger. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5571.1(b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1). Where an ordinance is challenged more than 30 days after its intended effective date, the Legislature required the challenger to prove there was a failure to <em>substantially </em>comply with statutory procedure, which resulted in lack of notice or a deprivation of due process rights. <em>See id., </em>§ 5571.1(c), (e)(2)(h). Additionally, in <em>Schadler </em>and <em>Glen-Gery, </em>we noted reliance by a municipality and landowners on a procedurally defective ordinance may be presumed if the ordinance has been in effect for an extended time. As a result, the Legislature added § 5571.1(d)(2) and (e)(2)(iii), creating a presumption of reliance by municipalities and landowners where an ordinance has been in effect for more than two years.</p>
    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[179,1600,1152,766]]]'>Appellants’ assertion that it is never appropriate to decline to apply the void <em>ab initio </em>doctrine because of alleged or actual reliance is misguided. As we have previously stated, there are numerous reasons to decline to apply the void <em>ab initio </em>doctrine, and an overly aggressive application of the doctrine could result in excessive uncertainty. The purpose of complying with statutory procedure is to ensure public notice, rather than compliance with ministerial filing provisions; this salient result is accomplished once sufficient time has passed, based on acquiescence by landowners and residents through their compliance -with a municipality’s application of an ordinance. <em>See Glen-Gery, </em>at 1039 n. 6 (quoting <em>Schadler, </em>at 627); <em>see also Geryville Materials, Inc. v.

Pursuant to § 5571.1(e)(2)(iii), reliance on an ordinance becomes a rebuttable presumption only after a municipality and its landowners have been subject to it for two years. Both the municipality’s and the public’s reliance on an ordinance strengthens with the history of its use. Citizens must be able to rely on zoning classifications, as constant invalidation of ordinances would degrade constituents’ faith in the system and result in chaos.
