      <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>The relevant background of this matter is as follows. On February 7, 2009, at around 1:30 a.m., Jamel Clay, James Claybrook, and Rashid Lewis (collectively, “Appellees”) visited R.B. at her college dormitory in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Upon their arrival at the dormitory, Appellees signed in and provided the security officer with photo identification. Appellees spent the next several hours socializing with R.B. and her friend, H.S., who lived in the same hall. Eventually, at approximately 3:30 a.m., the group discussed sleeping arrangements, and, according to Appellees, H.S. invited them to stay in her room. At trial, H.S. testified that Appellees “ended up” in her room because it was the one nearest to where the group was gathered at the time the socializing concluded, but she did not dispute that she allowed them to stay. There also was testimony at trial that H.S. had engaged in approximately 18 telephone calls with her friend Richard earlier in the evening, during which H.S. informed him that she was planning to allow Appellees to stay in her room, and Richard warned her not to do so.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[260,1366,1152,568]]]'>When Claybrook and Lewis first entered H.S.’s room, Lewis sat on her bed and Claybrook sat on H.S.’s roommate’s bed. Clay either entered the room at the same time as Claybrook and Lewis, or shortly thereafter. At trial, H.S. testified that she asked Lewis to get off her bed, but he refused, and so she laid down next to him, back to back. H.S. stated that, after five to ten minutes, Lewis attempted to kiss her, and when she said no and attempted to get off the bed, he pulled her towards him, kissed her, and fondled her breasts. H.S. testified that, at some point, she scratched Lewis in an effort to resist him.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[256,1985,1153,360]],["BL_487.1",487,[163,310,1151,249]]]'>Lewis testified that, after he sat on H.S.’s bed, H.S. never asked him to get off the bed, and it was she who attempted to kiss him. At some point, after Clay entered the room and laid down in H.S.’s roommate’s bed, Claybrook got into H.S.’s bed with H.S. and Lewis. Over the next hour, all three Appellees engaged in vaginal intercourse and oral sex with H.S., some of which involved all three of the men at the same time. H.S. <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>also testified that each of the three men engaged in anal intercourse with her, although both Claybrook and Lewis denied having anal intercourse with H.S. Clay did not testify at trial. The hospital examination revealed ejaculate in H.S.’s rectum.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[163,590,1153,737]]]'>H.S. testified that Appellees initially restrained her, but conceded she was not held down the entire time. Appellees denied restraining H.S. at any time. Midway through the incident, Lewis and Clay left the room to obtain more condoms while Claybrook remained in the room with H.S. H.S. testified at trial that, during this time, Claybrook “was forcing me to have oral sex with him____He had his hands on the side of my head and he forced his penis into my mouth.” N.T. Trial, 10/26/09, at 162. When asked what kept her from leaving the room at that point, H.S. testified “I was just scared. I was really scared. I didn’t know what was going to happen.” <em>Id. </em>at 162-68. H.S. further testified that “they were three strangers that I didn’t know, and they were forcing me to do these things with them.” <em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>
    <p id="b487-8" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[165,1351,1152,413]]]'>When Lewis and Clay returned, they each engaged in further sexual acts with H.S. H.S. testified that, except for the first time she told Lewis “no” when he tried to kiss her, she did not tell Appellees to stop, did not cry out for help, and did not attempt to leave the room. She explained in her trial testimony, when asked why she did not scream, that “[m]ost of the time I had somebody restrained over me, or I had somebodfy’s] penis in my mouth.” <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>
    <p id="b487-9" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[166,1787,1152,416]],["BL_488.1",488,[278,318,1148,87]]]'>Thereafter, Appellees indicated they wanted to smoke, but H. S. asked them smoke outside so they would not set off the smoke alarm and get her in trouble. While Appellees were outside smoking, H.S. went down the hall to the bathroom and brushed her teeth. She then returned to her room and left the door open while she changed her sheets and picked up condoms from the floor. Appellees returned to the doorway of H.S.’s room<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Lewis asked for a clean shirt to wear, as <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>the shirt he was wearing had blood on it.

    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[274,438,1152,1028]]]'>Appellees then left, at which point H.S. called her friend Richard and assured him that everything was fine. Several minutes later, however, she sent Richard a text message telling him that she had lied, that everything was not okay, and that she had been raped. H.S. then told her friend, R.B., that Appellees had raped her. At R.B.’s suggestion, H.S. contacted her Resident Assistant and Resident Director about the incident. The Resident Director reported the incident to campus police on H.S.’s behalf. H.S. then went to the hospital to be examined. Karen Dougherty, a registered nurse in the Crozier Emergency Department, examined H.S. Nurse Dougherty testified that she is a forensic nurse examiner and a sexual assault nurse examiner (“SANE”) who had practiced nursing for 30 years and had conducted approximately 200 sexual assault exams. N.T. Trial, 10/27/09, at 484-86. Nurse Dougherty stated that, upon examining H.S., she observed a “suction mark” on her neck, a light scratch on her arm, a small abrasion on her inner elbow, and redness on her inner thighs. <em>Id. </em>at 491. The nurse also noted that H.S. told her she had scratched Lewis in self-defense.</p>

On October 29, 2009, following a three-day joint jury trial before the Honorable James MacElree, at which H.S. testified that she was sexually assaulted by all three appellees, and Claybrook and Lewis testified that the sexual encounters with H.S. were consensual, all three appellees were convicted of sexual assault,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> indecent assault,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and false imprisonment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On March 25, 2010, each Appellee was sentenced to two to four years incarceration and two years consecutive probation. Appellees filed a timely joint motion for post-sentence relief, arguing the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions on all of <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the charges and that the jury’s verdicts were against the weight of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[162,428,1154,955]]]'>On May 25, 2010, following a hearing, the trial court granted Appellees’ motion for judgment of acquittal on the false imprisonment charges but denied Appellees’ motion for judgment of acquittal and/or a new trial on the sexual assault and indecent assault charges. In reviewing Appellees’ challenge to the weight of the evidence, the trial court, without citing to specific evidence in the record, opined that the case was “extremely close,” and, although the court was “surprised and taken aback” by the jury’s guilty verdicts on the sexual assault and indecent assault charges, the verdicts were not so contrary to the evidence as to shock the court’s conscience. Trial Court Opinion at 6. The court, therefore, declined to grant Appellees a new trial, but noted “the jury’s verdicts might shock the conscience of the Superior Court, in which case the Superior Court may vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the case for a new trial on the Sexual Assault and Indecent Assault charges.” <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Appellees each filed appeals, which were consolidated.</p>
    <p id="b489-6" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[169,1405,1153,953]],["BL_490.1",490,[269,313,1151,742]]]'>The Superior Court unanimously reversed the trial court’s decision on Appellees’ weight of the evidence claims. Although the court acknowledged that the proper standard of review was abuse of discretion, the court stated it “must look at the evidence as presented at trial to determine the proper outcome for this case.” <em>Commonwealth v. Lewis, Clay, and Claybrook, </em>1762 EDA 2010, 1835 EDA 2010, 1926 EDA 2010, unpublished memorandum at 9 (Pa.Super. filed May 24, 2011). The court then considered the evidence presented at trial and concluded it was “manifestly unreasonable” to conclude that H.S. did not consent to the sexual activity. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Specifically, the court noted: (1) at trial, H.S. denied inviting Appellees to sleep in her room, despite substantial evidence to the contrary; (2) when Lewis refused to get off her bed, H.S. did not demand Appellees leave her room, nor did she leave the room herself; (3) other than initially telling Lewis “no” when he attempted to kiss her and then scratching him, H.S. did not tell Appellees to stop, cry out for help, try to escape, or <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>physically resist Appellees; (4) after the sexual activity ended, H.S. felt comfortable asking Appellees to smoke outside and, while Appellees were outside, H.S. did not lock her door to keep Appellees from coming back to her room; (5) the evidence established that Appellees returned to H.S.’s room after smoking, despite H.S.’s trial testimony to the contrary; and (6) H.S. suffered “minor” physical injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Based on these factors, the Superior Court concluded “despite Judge MacElree’s statement that the verdict did not shock <em>his </em>conscience, guilty verdicts based on the record before us should shock the conscience of <em>anyone </em>seeking to ‘reach a dispassionate conclusion.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 11 (emphasis original). The court thus held the trial court’s decision was an abuse of discretion and vacated Appellees’ convictions.</p>
