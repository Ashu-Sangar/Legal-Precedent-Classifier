The statute generally prohibits intercepting, using, or disclosing private communications except pursuant to specified procedures. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5708 (pertaining to court orders authorizing interceptions). The Act does, however, allow county correctional facilities to monitor and record inmate phone calls without any specific prior authorization, so long as inmates are notified in writing and anyone calling into the facility is also told that his call may be monitored and recorded. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14).

    <p id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[158,707,1152,828]]]'>In 2005, Monroe County Detective Eric Kerchner and First Assistant District Attorney Michael Mancuso (Appellees) were investigating and prosecuting Dennis Slayton for theft and drug-related offenses, as well as his paramour Jill Goldstein in connection with the drug offenses. Appellant John P. Karoly, Jr., Esq., was acting as Slayton’s attorney during this time. Appellant also represented Goldstein in June 2005 at her preliminary hearing, at which Detective Kerchner testified. On October 3, 2005, Goldstein appeared at a bail revocation hearing represented by Eric Dowdle, Esq. At the conclusion, bail was revoked and Goldstein was placed in custody at the Monroe County Correctional Facility (the “MCCF”). The next day, October 4, 2005, Goldstein called Slayton from the jail. During the conversation, Appellant, who was with Slay-ton, began speaking with Goldstein. The MCCF recorded the conversation.</p>
    <p id="b551-8" data-blocks='[["BL_551.7",551,[161,1567,1150,562]]]'>During its ongoing criminal investigation, the Monroe County district attorney’s office formed a belief that Goldstein was communicating from the jail with Slayton, and that obtaining these conversations could aid the investigation. Accordingly, it applied to the common pleas court for an order instructing the MCCF to disclose Goldstein’s recorded telephone conversations. On October 14, 2005, the court issued an order directing the MCCF to furnish such recordings. The order stated that the disclosure application and the order itself were to remain sealed. Thus, it directed the MCCF not to reveal the existence of either document.</p>

The detective played these tapes for members of the district attorney’s <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>office. After hearing the tapes, ADA Mancuso filed, in the criminal case against Slayton, a Motion to Compel and Disqualify Counsel (“Motion to Disqualify”), requesting that Appellant be disqualified from further representing Slayton. The request was predicated on an alleged conflict of interest, as well as Appellant’s alleged refusal to tell the authorities where Slayton was hiding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The motion also requested that Appellant be compelled to furnish any information he had concerning Slayton’s whereabouts. Its averments included an excerpt of a transcript of the October 4th telephone call, in which Appellant discusses the difficulties that might attend his simultaneous representation of Goldstein and Slayton. In the excerpt, Appellant eventually explains to Goldstein that he does not wish to be disqualified due to a perception that he is representing both individuals, and states that “I can direct your case through Eric while I’m doing [Slayton’s], okay?” <em>See </em>Motion to Disqualify, at ¶ 8, <em>reproduced </em>in R.R. 43-44. The Commonwealth’s brief in support of its motion also recited the same portion of the conversation. <em>See </em>R.R. at 55. Because the motion and brief were not filed under seal, they became publicly accessible. Appellees allegedly faxed copies of the documents to the <em>Morning Call </em>newspaper, which published the discussion between Goldstein and Appellant.</p>

      <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>In the amended complaint, Appellant alleged that Appellees committed multiple violations of the Wiretap Act. Most notably, Appellant contended that: ADA Mancuso violated Section 5703(2) of the Act, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5703(2) (generally making it a felony to divulge to another person the contents of any intercepted communication, except as otherwise provided in the Act), by disclosing the conversation between Appellant and Goldstein when he included it in legal filings that were not placed under seal; and ADA Mancuso and Detective Kerchner conspired to transmit such filings to the press. On the basis of this conduct, Appellant asserted that Appellees intentionally violated the statute and, as such, should be removed from their employment pursuant to Section 5726.</p>

In their brief in support of summary judgment, Appellees argued that the use and disclosure of recorded inmate conversations are specifically authorized by Section 5704(14), <em>see Commonwealth v. Baumhammers, </em><a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="599 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="3441393" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01">599 Pa. 1</a>, 33-34, <a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">960 A.2d 59</a>, 79 (2008), as well as Section 5717, which pertains to the use of intercepted communications by law enforcement personnel in furtherance of their official duties. In this regard, Appellees contended that the October 14th order permitted the disclosure of the conversation between Appellant and Goldstein to the district attorney’s office, and that Appellees used such information in the course of their official duties, thus complying with Section 5717. Appellees also emphasized that removal from employment is a drastic remedy and that the Commonwealth Court has never granted such relief under the Wiretap Act.</p>

He emphasized that such disclosure to the public exceeded the permissible use of the conversation for law enforcement purposes. Additionally, Appellant argued that his conversation with Goldstein was protected by the attorney-client privilege under the exception set forth at Section 5704(14)(ii), which forbids the interception or use of “any conversation between an inmate and an attorney.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14)(ii). He reasoned, in this regard, that he was acting as Goldstein’s attorney at the time of the call, and that even if the court found to the contrary, the conversation was still privileged because, as Appellees were aware, Appellant had previously represented Goldstein’s in the matter for which she was detained — namely, at her June 2005 preliminary hearing. In support of this latter contention, Appellant referenced <em>In re Investigating Grand Jury (Appeal of Stretton), </em><a href="/a2d/887/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="887 A.2d 257" data-case-ids="8998696" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0257-01">887 A.2d 257</a> (Pa.Super.2005), for the position that the attorney-client privilege extends to conversations between an attorney and his former client where the parties discuss the case in which the attorney provided representation.</p>

Addressing Appellant’s suggestion predicated upon Section 5714(b), the court developed that that provision only applies to communications that are intercepted and recorded in the first instance pursuant to a court order. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5712 (providing specifications for such orders). Since, under Section 5704(14), a court order is not required to record inmate conversations, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5704 (preamble), the court determined that Section 5714(b) was not intended to apply to the interception of Goldstein’s phone call. <em>See Karoly v.

      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>As for the Section 5704(14)(ii) exception relating to the attorney-client privilege, the court held that such provision was inapplicable, since Goldstein was not represented by Appellant at the time of the call, as evidenced by the fact that a different attorney handled the bail revocation hearing the previous day, and by Appellant’s statement in the call that he could not represent Goldstein. The court suggested that the provision’s reference to “an attorney” should not be read to mean any attorney, as that subsection’s express purpose is to “safeguard the attorney-client privilege.” <em>Karoly, </em>No. 622 M.D. 2005, <em>slip op. </em>at 14-15 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14)(ii) and citing <em>Chimenti v.

Notably, the court did not address Appellant’s alternative argument relating to the confidentiality of conversations with former clients, and instead framed its disposition by reasoning that “there is no real factual dispute that Mancuso and Kerchner could have believed, in good faith, that the conversation was not privileged.” <em>Id. </em>at 15.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court found that the order’s plain language, which authorized the MCCF to provide the recordings of the phone calls, states only that the order and the underlying application are to remain under seal, but is silent regarding the disclosure of any recordings obtained from the jail. <em>See id. </em>at 13.</p>

The court expressed that, although a factual dispute remained regarding whether Appellees had transmitted these documents to the <em>Morning Call, </em>such issue was not material to the question of whether Appellees violated the Wiretap Act. The court specified, in this respect, that even if Appellees had distributed the documents to the newspaper, such transmittal occurred after the documents had become matters of public record through being filed in the court. <em>See Karoly, </em>No. 622 M.D. 2005, <em>slip op. </em>at 16.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

He asserts that the violations of the Wiretap Act by Appellees were not based on good-faith reliance on the Act’s provisions, but reflect the animus subsisting between the parties. Appellant renews his argument that all materials obtained pursuant to the October 14th order were to remain under seal until the common pleas court directed otherwise, and submits that a contrary interpretation would lead to an absurd result whereby a court order allowing intercepted communications to be divulged to the police must be kept secret, while the contents of those communications may be publicly disclosed. Appellant states that the Commonwealth Court erred in endorsing such reasoning since it obviates the Wiretap Act’s overriding purpose of protecting privacy. In this regard, Appellant stresses that the Act’s provisions are to be strictly construed, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant, at 16 (quoting <em>Kopko v.

As a general proposition, I agree the “use” permitted under subsection (a.l) is broader than the “disclosure” permitted under subsection (a), and that “any such use should be as consistent as is practicable with Section 5717(a)’s narrow restrictions on disclosure — that is, the disclosure should not exceed that which is essential to the effective use.” <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 504, 65 A.3d at 312.</p>
