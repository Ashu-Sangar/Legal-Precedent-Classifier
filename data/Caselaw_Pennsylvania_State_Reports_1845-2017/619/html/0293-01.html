In 2008, one of his students alleged he offered her $300 to have sex with him and touched her buttocks; she further stated he gave her one of his business cards and wrote his private cell phone number on it. After these allegations surfaced, appellee, who was 67 years old, retired from teaching and began receiving pension payments of $1,500 per month. Shortly after appellee retired, he was charged for the above incident. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, appellee pled guilty to corruption of a minor<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and indecent assault of a person less than 16 years of age.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He was sentenced to probation; no direct appeal was filed.</p>

The court concluded: (1) the legislature intended forfeiture of pension benefits under PEPFA to be a civil sanction; (2) pension forfeiture is an affirmative disability; (3) there does not appear to be a historical use of pension forfeiture as applied to criminal behavior; (4) no independent finding of <em>scienter </em>is required to trigger pension forfeiture; (5) the underlying behavior to which pension forfeiture applies is solely criminal; (6) pension forfeiture promotes the traditional aims of punishment, acting as both retribution and deterrence; and (7) there is no alternative purpose for pension forfeiture, and thus there is no need to determine whether the sanction appears excessive in relation to such purpose. <em>Abraham, </em>at 1093-94. Based on these guideposts, the court concluded, “[I]t is apparent the loss of pension is punitive in nature.” <em>Id., </em>at 1094.

Thus, the Court declined to rule on the specific question before us: whether the <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>direct versus collateral consequences analysis is appropriate in assessing a claim of ineffectiveness in connection with entry of a plea. Instead, the starting point for the Court’s analysis was that deportation was a unique consequence which did not lend itself to such an analysis. The Court, in examining the nature of deportation, observed:</p>
    <blockquote id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[205,647,1109,578]]]'>We have long recognized that deportation is a particularly severe “penalty”; but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil in nature, deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal convictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a century. And, importantly, recent changes in our immigration law have made removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders. Thus, we find it “most difficult” to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context.</blockquote>

PEPFA “is imposed on all those who have committed certain crimes in the past, regardless of intent or awareness of the statute.” <em>Lehman, </em>at 272. All that was required for PEPFA to apply to appellee was that he be convicted of one of the offenses listed in Chapter 31 of the Crimes Code. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1312 (defining crimes related to public office or public employment as any of offenses in Subchapter B of Chapter 31, when offense is committed by school employee against student); <em><a href="/us/511/0767-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="511 U.S. 767" data-case-ids="1147262" data-case-paths="/us/511/0767-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 1313 (no public employee shall be entitled to receive any retirement, other benefit, or payment of any kind if such employee pleads guilty to any crime related to public employment).</p>

Should the employee breach that trust by committing one of the enumerated offenses, which include crimes of sexual impropriety with underage students, the Pennsylvania State Retirement Board is relieved of its contractual obligation to pay retirement benefits.

The definitional section of PEPFA, however, appears to extend the application of the forfeiture provision to retired employees. 43 P.S. § 1312 (defining "public official” or "public employee” as "[a]ny person who is elected or appointed to any public office or employment ... or who is acting or who has acted in behalf of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision or any agency thereof including but not limited to any person who has so acted and is otherwise entitled to or is receiving retirement benefits...."). A political subdivision includes a school district. <em><a href="/a3d/23/1059-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="23 A.3d 1059" data-case-ids="7283456" data-case-paths="/a3d/23/1059-01">Id.</a></em>

The Court ruled that an attorney’s duty under the Sixth Amendment to provide effective assistance of counsel during the plea process encompassed advising the client about the potential consequence of deportation as the result of entering a guilty plea to a federal narcotics conviction. <em>Padilla </em>thereby seemingly rejected the rationale employed by our Court in our prior decision of <em>Commonwealth v. Frometa, </em><a href="/pa/520/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="520 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1815635" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0552-01">520 Pa. 552</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="520 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1815635" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0552-01">555 A.2d 92</a> (1989), wherein we concluded that counsel was not ineffective for failing to warn his client that a guilty plea to various drug offenses could result in the client’s deportation. Nevertheless, the majority herein presently concludes that <em>Frometa </em>survives as support for the general proposition that a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel is not violated whenever counsel fails to inform the defendant of collateral consequences — other <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>than deportation — resulting from the entry of a guilty plea, even if those consequences will have a severe impact on the defendant’s life. Thus, relying on <em>Frometa, </em>the majority holds that counsel in this matter was under no obligation to warn Appellee that his plea of guilty to indecent assault, 18 Pa. C.S.A. § 3126(a)(8), would, due to the automatic triggering of the provisions of the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act (“PEPFA”), result in the forfeiture of his monthly pension benefits, as the majority considers such consequences to be merely collateral.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[166,860,1154,1115]]]'>I believe the majority’s reliance on <em>Frometa </em>is misplaced because the high Court indicated in <em>Padilla </em>that counsel’s Sixth Amendment duty to warn his or her client of an adverse consequence of a guilty plea is not dependent on whether the consequence can be labeled direct or collateral; rather, it is determined by the severity of the consequence, and the degree to which the consequence and the underlying criminal proceeding are closely connected. <em>Padilla </em>suggests that where a specific consequence is a “particularly severe ‘penalty,’” is “intimately related to the criminal process,” and the statutory provisions providing for the imposition of the consequence are “succinct, clear, and explicit” and, thus, can “easily be determined” by a reading of the statutory text, <em>Padilla, </em><a href="/l-ed-2d/176/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="559 U.S. 356" data-case-ids="12447673,3581896" data-case-paths="/l-ed-2d/176/0284-01,/us/559/0356-01">130 S.Ct. at 1481-83</a>, counsel’s Sixth Amendment duty of effective representation includes warning the client of that consequence when advising him or her whether or not to take a plea. Therefore, under <em>Padilla, </em>in situations such as those presented by the case at bar where the consequence of a guilty plea is manifestly severe and certain to result upon the entry of the plea, I would deem the mechanistic direct/collateral consequence rubric of <em>Frometa </em>to have no continuing vitality.</p>

However, the resolution of the question of whether a guilty plea has been entered voluntarily and knowingly is a determination of whether the defendant has been accorded due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution in connection with the entry of the plea. <em>See McCarthy v.

In <em>Padilla, </em>the Court found that the penalty of deportation was intimately related to the underlying drug conviction because deportation had been “enmeshed” with criminal proceedings under the two statutory schemes, and, also, because the consequence was “nearly an automatic result” of the plea. <em>Padilla, </em><a href="/l-ed-2d/176/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="185" data-cite="559 U.S. 356" data-case-ids="12447673,3581896" data-case-paths="/l-ed-2d/176/0284-01,/us/559/0356-01">130 S.Ct. at 1481</a>. PEPFA, by its design and basic structure, is inextricably “enmeshed” with our Crimes Code as it is only upon a plea of guilty or conviction for one of the specific criminal offenses enumerated in PEPFA, committed during the course of public employment, that the pension forfeiture provisions are triggered. Relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the penalty of pension forfeiture for a school employee was specifically conjoined with the criminal offense of indecent <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>assault when the legislature amended PEPFA in 2004 to include indecent assault and other sexual crimes in PEPFA’s definition of “crimes relating to public employment.” <em>See </em>Act No. 2004-86, S.B. No. 971, “Labor-Pension Forfeiture-Sexual Offenses by School Employees,” Preamble. Further, for a public employee such as Appellee, PEPFA unambiguously provides that “benefits shall be forfeited upon entry of a plea of guilty.” 43 P.S. § 1313(b). Hence, the forfeiture penalty at issue in this case is not just “nearly automatic”, as was the deportation consequence in <em>Padilla; </em>rather, it was certain to occur upon Appellee’s entry of a plea to the charge of indecent assault. Additionally, the provisions of PEPFA providing for automatic forfeiture are quite “succinct, clear, and explicit,” and their applicability to Appellee’s situation could have “easily be[en] determined” by a simple reading of the plain text of PEPFA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_6" id="ref_footnote_5_6">6</a>

In examining the same professional standards of representation for counsel in a criminal matter which were looked to by the Court in <em>Padilla, </em>I note that the weight of prevailing professional norms requires counsel to advise a client who is considering a guilty plea to an offense of the possible forfeiture of his assets which may result from the plea. <em>See </em>National Legal Aid and Defender Assn., <em>Performance Guidelines for Criminal Representation </em>§ 6.2(a) (1995) (explaining that counsel’s duty in plea negotiations includes becoming “fully aware of’ and making sure that the client “is fully aware of: ...

Yet, despite this knowledge and counsel’s explicit recommendation to Appellee to retire, the record is devoid of any evidence that counsel ascertained what effect the plea agreement would have on Appellee’s pension. As discussed above, a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions of PEPFA indicate that his client, as a retired school teacher who received his pension from the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System, stood to lose the entirety of his monthly pension if he accepted the plea to indecent assault. To reiterate, Section 1313 of PEPFA provides that the retirement benefits of a “public employee” will “be forfeited upon entry of a plea of guilty.” 43 P.S. § 1313.
