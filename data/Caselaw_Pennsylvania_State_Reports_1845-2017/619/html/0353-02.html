After careful review, we conclude that an order granting a motion for post-conviction DNA testing pursuant to Section 9543.1 is a final order under Pa.R.A.P. 341, and, therefore, we reverse the Superior Court’s order and remand to that court to consider the merits of the issues presented in the Commonwealth’s appeal.</p>

He received an aggregate sentence of 30-60 years incarceration. Appellee pursued a direct appeal, and his convictions and sentence were affirmed by the Superior Court. Appellee next pursued a petition for collateral relief under the former Post Conviction Hearing Act, which was denied by the trial court, and the denial was upheld by the Superior Court.

That same day, Appellee also filed a separate motion pursuant to Section 9543.1 of the PCRA seeking post-conviction DNA testing of a palm print lifted from a lamp pulled down during the commission of the crime, fingernail clippings of the victims, and a blood print found near the bodies of the two children.

    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[265,1186,1153,782]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that, analogous to <em>Romolini, </em>the DNA testing order constituted the trial court’s final determination of the only question presented by Appellee’s petition — his eligibility for DNA testing — and no further proceedings existed in which the Commonwealth could challenge the grant of DNA testing. The Commonwealth stresses that the sole claim presented by Appellee in his motion for DNA testing, and pending before the trial court at the time of entry of its order, was whether DNA testing should be granted; thus, in its view, the DNA testing order disposed of this claim and, indeed, the entire case since, according to the Commonwealth, the underlying criminal case had ended, and Appellee was merely trying to resurrect it utilizing these means. Thus, the Commonwealth asserts that the DNA testing order must be considered a final order under Pa.R.A.P. 341.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that, under Pa.

The Commonwealth reasons that, because the motion for DNA testing is a petition for post-conviction relief, the DNA testing order is final under Rule 910, and, thus, an independent basis (from Pa.R.A.P. 341) for concluding the DNA testing order is final and reviewable on appeal.</p>

Appellee’s Brief at 11. Appellee argues that, if the DNA testing petition is denied, the litigation is over; however, if it is granted, then it is merely a preliminary step which “might support a later claim for post-conviction relief.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.

Endorsing the reasoning of the Superior Court below, Appellee likens the DNA testing order to a discovery order entered in proceeding under the PCRA which is interlocutory, and, thus, not appealable, since there is no general right of appeal in a PCRA proceeding by a losing party before the disposition of the entire case. Accordingly, Appellee maintains that, because Rule 910 speaks only of orders which grant or finally dispose of a petition for collateral relief, it does not apply to the present order which merely granted Appellee’s motion for DNA testing.</p>

Appellee also points out that deferring review of this issue until entry of a final order regarding a PCRA petition based on the DNA test results is in accord with our policy of discouraging piecemeal appeals which disfavor indigent litigants such as himself who must expend resources and suffer delay as the result of multiple appeals.</p>

See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543.1(f)(1) (“After the DNA testing conducted under this section has been completed, the applicant may ... petition to the court for postconviction relief pursuant to Section 9543(a)(2)(vi).”) (emphasis added). Hence, the filing of a later PCRA petition by the successful movant constitutes the commencement of separate and new litigation, which, as discussed above, has as its ultimate object the grant of a new trial, discharge from the underlying conviction, or modification of the petitioner’s sentence, and this subsequent PCRA petition will be considered according to the standards for obtaining relief under Section 9543(a)(2)(vi) of the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543.1(f)(3) (“In any hearing <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>on a petition for postconviction relief [based on the results of the DNA testing], the court shall determine whether the exculpatory evidence resulting from the DNA testing conducted under this section would have changed the outcome of the trial as required by section 9543(a)(2)(vi)”).</p>

In the latter situation, a trial court’s order granting a PCRA petitioner’s discovery request does not end the PCRA proceedings, as, after discovery has been conducted, further litigation on the claims raised in the petition will inevitably follow. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a) (requiring PCRA petitioner to “plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence” the requirements enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(1) and (2)). Consequently, the discovery order is but a step in the overall litigation process of the merits of the underlying substantive claims raised in the PCRA petition.

It is entirely conceivable, then, that a movant who obtains DNA testing may subsequently elect not to pursue a PCRA petition for a variety of reasons. Thus, were a DNA testing order not to be final and appealable, the Commonwealth would be foreclosed in such circumstances from obtaining appellate review of the propriety of the original order granting the testing. Furthermore, although in the instant matter Appel<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>lee is paying the costs of the DNA testing, in other situations where the Commonwealth is statutorily required to assume the costs of such testing, the Commonwealth would be forced to shoulder the burden of those costs, even if the testing has been ordered in error.

      <p id="b423-11" data-blocks='[["BL_423.10",423,[209,1813,1118,546]]]'>While we note the Commonwealth failed to file a response to Appellee's motion to quash filed in the Superior Court, as discussed above, the Commonwealth did assert in its statement of jurisdiction in its brief filed in that court, consistent with its current position, that the DNA testing order was final, and jurisdiction was proper for that reason. Further, as our Court has held, ”[t]he question of the appealability of an order goes to the jurisdiction of the Court requested to entertain the question. Questions relating to jurisdiction are not waived by the failure of the parties to raise them, and may properly be raised by the court <em>sua sponte." Fried v.

The parties do not presently suggest that subdivisions (b)(2), (b)(3), or any other subdivision of Rule 341 are applicable to the resolution of this matter. Inasmuch as our review confirms the Superior Court’s specific finding that subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) of Rule 341 do not apply to render the DNA testing order final, as the DNA testing order has not been expressly defined as a final order by any statute, nor did the trial court certify the DNA testing order as immediately appealable under Pa.R.A.P. 341(c), we will, accordingly, focus our discussion on whether the DNA testing order meets the requirements for finality set forth in Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(2).</p>

This legislation would provide that testing and provide a payment process for it and a process in which an individual could easily present their case, and a judge could then decide whether they would be allowed to have the testing or not, and they would be allowed to have it if the evidence would prove their innocence, or if you are on death row to prove that they were innocent of the crime and/or that an aggravating circumstance was not justified.</blockquote>

Because of this clear difference in statutory nomenclature used by the legislature, we decline to find, as the Commonwealth urges, that an order resolving a motion for DNA testing is encompassed within the class of orders described in Pa.R.Crim.P. 910, which, by its plain terms, refers to orders granting or denying a PCRA petition. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 910 ("An order granting, denying, dismissing, or otherwise finally disposing of a petition for post-conviction collateral relief shall constitute a final order for purposes of appeal.”)</p>
