Instead, he declared, “I think I want to talk to Frank Cori [his attorney] before I make a statement.” Contrary to the Opinion in Support of Reversal, I do not believe that employment of the phrase “I think,” in and of itself, renders the statement equivocal, as such term can be colloquially used to express one’s beliefs and not to suggest that one is pondering or contemplating an action. Viewing Champney’s reference in light of what a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood the statement to mean, as <em>Davis </em>expressly directs, the PCRA court concluded that the import of the statement was clear. It found that Champney was not merely deliberating as to whether he might want an attorney, but rather was responding directly to Sergeant Shinskie’s point blank inquiry, “Did you shoot Roy Bensinger?” Faced with the most obvious request for an admission of guilt, Champney replied, “I think I should talk to Frank Cori before I make a statement.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">2</a> The PCRA court viewed this statement as a declaration of a desire to consult with a particular counsel prior to any further interrogation, and there is no basis in law or in fact to disturb this conclusion.</p>

Champney’s statements to police on May 13,1998, constituted a significant portion of the Commonwealth’s case against him. Indeed, they were crucial in establishing his participation in the murder of Roy Bensinger, particularly where there was no eyewitness testimony, no physical evidence, and no forensic evidence linking him to the offense. As described by the police officers in their reports, which were admitted into evidence, Champney’s comments and gestures indicated that he had intimate knowledge as to: where the firearms were kept in the Bensinger residence; how much ammunition was missing from the home; and the fact that the murder weapon had not been destroyed, but was being held by an undisclosed individual. One could further imply guilt from Champney’s inquiry as to what he was “looking at,” and his direction to Sergeant Shinskie to get the District Attorney so that he could “lay it out for him.” Such expressions of knowledge about the offense, which were emphasized by the Commonwealth in its closing argument, likely had a profound impact on the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">7</a> Moreover, and most significantly, the admission of the statements Champney made on May 13,1998, gave substantial credence to the otherwise arguably biased testimony of key Commonwealth witnesses David Blickley and Joy Hinshaw.</p>

Although the courts ensure compliance with the <em>Miranda </em>requirements through the exclusionary rule, it is police officers who must actually decide whether or not they can question a suspect. The <em>Edwards </em>rule — questioning must cease if the <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>suspect asks for a lawyer — provides a bright line that can be applied by officers in the real world of investigation and interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information. But if we were to require questioning to cease if a suspect makes a statement that <em>might </em>be a request for an attorney, this clarity and ease of application would be lost. Police officers would be forced to make difficult judgment calls about whether the suspect in fact wants a lawyer even though he has not said so, with the threat of suppression if they guess wrong. We therefore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney. Of course, when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.... Clarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect’s statement regarding counsel. But we decline to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions. If the suspect’s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.</blockquote>

According to Blickley’s interview, Champney told him the details of the murder while he was in prison; Blickley showed police the logistics of the shooting by pointing to places on a small photograph of the crime scene. He said nothing about Champney taking him to the crime scene and confiding how the shooting took place, which was the centerpiece of his trial testimony. <em>See </em>Homicide Investigation Action Report of Sergeant David Shinskie, 12/17/97. Sergeant Shinskie’s PCRA testimony confirmed Blickley never mentioned Champney took him to the crime scene and confided in him there, despite being asked to tell Sergeant Shinskie everything he knew about the murder.

Further, the report was that of someone other than Blickley; the report would likely have helped erode Blickley’s credibility, but its main value was to show Blickley claimed Champney confessed to him.

Thus, the need to “layer" ineffectiveness claims no longer existed when Champney filed his petition. Furthermore, Champney was represented by the same counsel at trial and on direct appeal; therefore, his first opportunity to challenge trial counsel’s performance was on collateral review, and he did not need to "layer” his ineffectiveness claims even under the old rule. However, in an abundance of caution, he pled both trial and appellate counsel's ineffectiveness in his PCRA petition. <em>See </em>PCRA Petition, 6/1/05, at 9. Pursuant to <em>Grant, </em>we need only focus on trial counsel’s performance in our analysis of the parties’ issues.</p>

Assuming Champney unequivocally asserted his right to counsel, the breaks in between his interrogations were longer than the 14-day bright-line rule in <em>Shatter </em>and arguably vitiated his invocation of the right. However, given the fact he was still in county prison, not yet convicted or sentenced, and still awaiting resolution of the charges against him, Shatter's applicability is questionable. <em>See Commonwealth v.
