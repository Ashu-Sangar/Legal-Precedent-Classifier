First, Appellant appeals from the denial of relief on the claims raised in his second PCRA petition, which we affirm because the contentions raised therein are untimely. Second, Appellant seeks review of the PCRA court’s denial of his motion for postconviction DNA testing, filed pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543.1. We affirm the denial of the DNA testing petition for a different reason than that offered by the PCRA court. We conclude that Appellant failed to demonstrate that his DNA testing petition was made “in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating [his] actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543.1(d)(l)(iii).</p>

To summarize, on July 14, 1989, after a non jury trial, Appellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree, rape, statutory rape, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. The Commonwealth’s evidence supporting these convictions showed that Appellant <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>kidnapped the two-year old victim, Bobbi Jo Matthew, from her bedroom in the early morning hours of October 5, 1988, drove her to a remote location, and proceeded to inflict separate and gruesome injuries on her. As we detailed in <em>Edmiston I, </em>the evidence demonstrated the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[190,579,1114,1001]]]'>Here, a two-year-old girl, weighing thirty-four pounds and standing thirty-six inches tall, suffered the following serious injuries: scalping, blunt force to her torso, obliteration of her genital area, burning of her body and a skull fracture. She was scalped by being cut with a sharp knife-like instrument from the ear up across the front hair line of her forehead and down to the other ear. Her scalp was then peeled back to the nape of her head exposing the entire skull. Blunt force trauma to her chest and stomach was so forceful that it caused the tearing of her liver and lungs. This force was also one of two possible causes of two feet of the infant’s intestines to protrude from her genital area. (The other possible cause was pulling the intestines out of the genital area). The genital area of the two-year-old child was completely obliterated and ripped to such an extent that there was only one large and bloody cavity where there originally were the anal and vaginal orifices. There were also areas of burning of the infant’s body, many other lacerations and abrasions and a skull fracture.</blockquote>

Appellant was acquainted with the victim’s family, and his uncle, Robert Brown, was Ms. Dotts’ boyfriend. On the night of October 4, 1988, the victim went to bed in a bedroom she shared with three other children. Two children saw a man in the bedroom talking to the victim at approximately 3:30 in the morning, whom they believed to be Ms. Dotts’ boyfriend, Mr. Brown. Mr. Matthew also observed a man in the house at that time, who said goodbye as he left. When the victim’s family discovered that she was missing on <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>the morning of October 5, 1988, they came to believe that the man who had been in the house in the middle of the night was Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[273,490,1149,366]]]'>Police arranged an interview with Appellant the following day. At the police barracks, Appellant waived his rights and consented to a search of his pickup truck, which revealed blood on the front seat, a blanket with fíne, blond hairs, a blood-stained towel, bloody scissors, and a pair of shorts that the victim’s family identified as those the victim wore to bed the night she disappeared.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[268,883,1153,738]]]'>The police confronted Appellant with what they discovered in his truck, voiced their suspicion, and asked him if he killed the victim. Although Appellant initially denied involvement, he soon began to waver. The police asked Appellant to reveal the location of the body. Appellant refused, but when the police asked Appellant to draw a map to the location of the victim’s body, he complied. When asked what the police would find at that location, Appellant responded that they would find “a dead raped little girl.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.) 7/10/89 at 103. He also stated that he did not know why he did it and began to cry. According to police, Appellant explained that the rape occurred in his pick-up truck, that he hit the victim several times with his fist, and ultimately covered her body with branches. <em>Id. </em>at 103-105.</p>
    <p id="b616-7" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[265,1648,1151,573]]]'>The police kept Appellant’s hand-drawn map in a notebook, and, because there was no photocopying equipment available, copied the map onto another piece of paper by hand. With the copy of the map in hand, police attempted to find the victim’s body. They enlisted the help of a local resident, Roger W. Kruis, who indicated his familiarity with the landmarks on the map and accompanied the police to the location. Police recovered the body at the location specified on the map. Additionally, investigators matched the tire tread and wear pattern found near the victim’s body with the tires on Appellant’s truck.</p>

N.T. 7/7/89 at 110. Dr. Jasnosz took oral as well as recto-vaginal smears and swabs from the victim. N.T. 7/7/89 at 130-31. Testing of blood samples taken from Appellant’s truck resulted only in identification of the blood as type “0,” which matched the blood type of both Appellant and the victim. As to the smears and swabs obtained by the Coroner, the laboratory the Commonwealth chose to conduct DNA testing reported that there was insufficient material for such DNA analysis. The defense chose another laboratory to conduct its own testing, which reported that it was able to extract DNA and that the DNA was from the victim. During a pre-trial conference, the defense indicated to the trial court that because Appellant’s DNA was not found on the samples it submitted to its laboratory, it chose to decline further testing, and Appellant indicated his agreement with this decision.</p>

Appellant relies on the exceptions of Section 9545(b)(l)(i) and (ii) to advance these issues. He asserts that the exception for governmental interference at Section 9545(b)(l)(i) applies because the Commonwealth interfered with the presentation of his claims by failing to provide him with mandatory discovery and exculpatory information, specifically, the Coroner’s photographs, statements by Mr. Kruis indicating that the map police showed him, which led to the discovery of the victim’s body, was not the one drawn by Appellant, and prior statements of Commonwealth witness Mr. Brown. Appellant further argues that these three pieces of evidence, which he discovered independently, constitute newly discovered facts within the exception contained at Section 9545(b)(l)(ii). Appellant also argues that he raised these claims on June 13, 2005, in the Second PCRA Petition, within 60 days of learning of the evidence on which each claim is based, thereby complying with Section 9545(b)(2).</p>

During the autopsy, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Vanneman also took color photographs of the victim’s body. Appellant asserts that despite defense counsel’s repeated requests for discovery, physical evidence, and records made in the course of scientific testing, the prosecutor did not deliver the actual Coroner’s photographs to trial counsel.

Appellant told police “you will find a dead raped little girl,” further advising police they would find the victim’s body off a certain road and covered with branches. When police used the map provided by Appellant, with the assistance of Mr. Kruis, they found the victim’s body at the location specified by Appellant. Police also found the victim’s shorts in Appellant’s truck; the hairs in Appellant’s truck were microscopically similar to the victim’s own hair; the tire tread and wear pattern near the child’s body were consistent with the tires on Appellant’s truck; and Appellant’s claim that the blood in his truck was his own and resulted from a cut on his arm was rebutted by prison officials who admitted Appellant to prison and noted no significant cuts on his body.</p>
