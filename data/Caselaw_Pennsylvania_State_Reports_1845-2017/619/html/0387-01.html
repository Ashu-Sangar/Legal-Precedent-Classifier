    <p class="author" id="b448-11" data-blocks='[["BL_448.10",448,[309,1756,290,33]]]'>PER CURIAM.</p>
    <p id="b448-12" data-blocks='[["BL_448.11",448,[263,1825,1150,530]],["BL_449.1",449,[163,316,1148,96]]]'>AND NOW, this 25th day of March, 2013, the March 6, 2006 order of the PCRA court is VACATED. For the reasons stated below, the PCRA petition and its amendments are reinstated, and the case is REMANDED to the PCRA court for review and disposition limited to the issues raised in the PCRA petition as amended, including holding an evidentiary hearing on any claim which the court believes raises a material issue of fact and is not resolvable as a matter of law, in accordance with applicable rules and decisional law. Furthermore, it is not clear that the record, as reconstructed, is <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>adequate for appellate review; the court is directed to determine any discrepancies in the reconstructed record.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[164,435,1153,681]]]'>This Court is unable to conduct effective appellate review in light of the PCRA court’s determination that many of appellant’s claims were waived or previously litigated without any recognition for this Court’s developing case law in the years between the filing of the PCRA petition in 1998 and the opinion in support of dismissal nine years later. Many of the issues were dismissed for pleading deficiencies, which should have been resolved by the PCRA court within the notice of intent to dismiss process. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(B), 907(1), and 909(B)(2); <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a> (2001). This failure on the part of the PCRA court has left this Court without any reasoned expression on the merits of those claims to assist us in our appellate review.</p>

But, appellant contends that pleadings and affidavits were omitted from the reconstructed record, and it appears, at least in some instances, that the PCRA court erred in finding the claims waived on this basis. The PCRA court also determined that three claims were previously litigated even though appellant pled those claims in the guise of trial counsel ineffectiveness. The PCRA court failed to acknowledge this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Collins, </em><a href="/pa/585/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="585 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="2471490" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0045-01">585 Pa. 45</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="888 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="2471490,8997420" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0045-01,/a2d/888/0564-01">888 A.2d 564</a> (2005), which made clear that claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness raise distinct Sixth Amendment claims, separate and apart from the underlying claims of trial court error; thus, prior litigation of a direct review claim does not necessarily preclude derivative claims of ineffectiveness. The PCRA court also addressed four claims on the merits, but found that certain sub-claims raised therein were waived because they were unsupported by proper documentation, <em>i.e., </em>affidavits and/or declarations. Again, appellant disputes this determination, offering that the affidavits/deelarations were included as exhibits to supplements that are not part of the reconstructed record. Furthermore, such pleading deficiencies (if there were any) were subject to the notice and <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>amendment procedure contemplated in the Rules enumerated above and in <em>Williams, supra.</em>
