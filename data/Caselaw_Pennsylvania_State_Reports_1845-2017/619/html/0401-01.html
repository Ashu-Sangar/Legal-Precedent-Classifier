Thus, we search the statute[, <em>i.e., </em>the Vehicle Code,] for authority abrogating the common law power of the sheriff, rather than statutory authority for the sheriff to enforce the law — authority he has always possessed under common law. In other words, although the Superior Court searched in vain for a provision which grants the sheriff an enforcement power under the motor vehicle laws, it is instead necessary to search for a statutory provision which removes the enforcement power of the sheriff (which preexisted the statute). The latter search is equally vain; there is, in the motor vehicle code, no unequivocal abrogation of the sheriffs common law power to arrest. It is evident, moreover, that the power to arrest subsumes the power to stop, detain, and investigate a motorist who breaches the peace while operating a motor vehicle in the presence of the sheriff.</blockquote>

First, in <em>Kline, </em>the sheriffs department at issue was assisted by five area municipal police departments in the operation of the sobriety checkpoint, <em>see Kline, </em><a href="/pa/559/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="559 Pa. 646" data-case-ids="837190" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0646-01">559 Pa. at 648</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/1281-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="741 A.2d 1281" data-case-ids="11658338,837190" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1281-01,/pa/559/0646-01">741 A.2d at 1281</a>, thus substantially clouding the “independence” issue. Moreover, since, as stated, the decision was focused on a collateral training question, the opinion provides no developed reasoning which would support the notion that sheriffs have the authority to independently establish and conduct sobriety checkpoints. Presumably, the dearth of discussion of the authority issue vis-a-vis checkpoints is on account of the framing of the litigants’ contentions, as no challenge on the overarching authority question appears to have been asserted. In light of the absence of a relevant focus, we decline to read <em>Kline </em>as transforming traditional, common-law peacekeeping powers into authority to conduct suspicionless stops. <em>See supra </em>note 4.</p>

In the ensuing interaction, the sheriff determined that the defendant-appellee’s license to drive had been suspended, noticed an open can of beer on the front seat, and also found controlled substances in the vehicle. The defendant-appellee ultimately was charged with several violations of the Vehicle Code as well as drug-related offenses. Before the trial court, he moved to suppress all the physical evidence obtained as a result of his stop and detention by the sheriff. The suppression court granted the defendant-appellee’s motion, concluding that the sheriff lacked the authority to stop a vehicle for a traffic violation. <em>See Leet, supra </em>at 300-01. The Superior Court affirmed the suppression order, holding that a sheriff does not have authority to enforce the Vehicle Code or make warrantless arrests for violations thereof, even those that occur in the sheriffs presence. In reaching this holding, the Superior Court relied on several Vehicle Code provisions vesting enforcement authority specifically and explicitly in police officers. For example, 75 Pa.C.S. § 6308(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[t]he operator of any vehicle ... reasonably believed to have violated any provision of this title shall stop upon request or signal of any police officer and shall, upon request, exhibit a registration card, driver’s license____” (Emphasis added). From this and other similar provisions of the Vehicle Code, the Superior Court concluded that the General Assembly had explicitly vested enforcement of the Vehicle Code in police officers and not in sheriffs. The Superior Court accordingly held that a sheriff was not authorized to stop a motorist and make an arrest for a Vehicle Code violation, even when the violation was committed in the presence of the sheriff.</p>

While these activities constitute major aspects of the operation of a DUI checkpoint, I recognize that other activities are necessary as well, <em>ie., </em>predetermining the objective standards as to which vehicles to stop; making a decision as to time and location of the checkpoint; providing warning of the checkpoint; physically erecting the checkpoint; and momentarily stopping vehicles for a brief observation.

While I acknowledge that a DUI checkpoint is a type of investigation, it is a systematic, controlled-step-by-controlled-step, highly regulated investigation, of very different character from the more open and varied, lengthier, less defined investigations contemplated under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act. I conclude that a DUI checkpoint investigation is more akin to the type of investigation that we considered in <em>Leet </em>and concluded was within the authority of a sheriff. Specifically, in <em>Leet, supra </em>at 303, we held that a sheriffs power to arrest “subsumes the power to stop, detain, and investigate a motorist who breaches the peace while operating a motor vehicle in the presence of the sheriff.” (emphasis added). A motorist under the influence of alcohol who drives a vehicle into a DUI checkpoint has, in fact, breached the peace while operating his or her motor vehicle in the presence of the law enforcement agents conducting the checkpoint, and those law enforcement agents — be they police officers or sheriffs — should have the authority to investigate the breach pursuant to our prior decisional law.</p>
