The question turns on whether the relevant payments constituted payments of “compensation” within the meaning of Section 443 of the Workers’ Compensation Act (“WCA”), 77 P.S. § 999(a), or, as argued by Appellant Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (“Bureau”), whether the payments are not reimbursable be-, cause they constitute payment of legal costs associated with obtaining a claimant’s third-party tort settlement under Section 319 of the WCA, 77 P.S. § 671. After review, we find no language in either Section 443 or Section 319 that would transform the relevant payments into something other than compensation merely because the amounts of the payments were calculated to compensate the claimant for the costs of recovering the third-party settlement. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

At its most basic, Section 319 provides that the employer shall recover from the settlement the amount it previously paid to the claimant, minus the claimant’s legal costs of recovering that amount. If the settlement exceeds the amount previously paid by the employer, then the balance is paid to the claimant but treated as advance payment of future compensation by the employer, such that the employer is granted a grace period during which it does not have to make compensation payments for a certain number of weeks. The employer, however, is responsible for the remaining legal costs of recovering the amount attributable to the grace period. While simple in concept, the application of Section 319 presents various complications, including how to treat the division of the attorney fees, which Section 319 directs to be prorated between the employer and the claimant.</p>

However, the court opined that Employer’s Insurer did not receive full reimbursement for that compensation from the third-party settlement because, pursuant to Section 319, Claimant’s costs of recovering the third-party settlement were deducted prior to the distribution to Employer’s Insurer. Additionally, the court observed that after the third-party settlement, Employer’s Insurer paid $164.42 per week, rather than paying Claimant the full $410.00 per week compensation.

It cites language in our decision in <em>Pergola, </em>that the Bureau maintains supports its argument: “[T]he grace period is that number of weeks in the future for which the employer does not have to pay claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits.” <em>Id. </em>at 19 (quoting <em>Pergola, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="701 A.2d 560" data-case-ids="11898760,17759" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0560-01,/pa/549/0490-01">701 A.2d at 563</a>) (emphasis omitted). The Bureau rejects the Commonwealth Court’s statement in footnote 12 where the court asserted that the Employer’s Insurer’s payments during the grace period were to ensure that Claimant received his full compensation rate of $410.00 per week. The Bureau argues that this statement is wrong because during the grace period Claimant was not owed any additional compensation from the Employer’s Insurer because Claimant had received the $189,301.52 Balance of Recovery which constituted all the compensation Claimant was due during the 461.7 weeks of the grace period. Instead, the Bureau reasserts that the payments made during the grace period were merely for the pro rata share of the attorney fees and costs associated with the benefit of not having to pay compensation during the grace period.</p>

Therefore, the Bureau contends that the payments were a result of the third-party settlement instead of the denial of supersedeas. The Bureau, however, fails to respond to the fact that had supersedeas been granted when first sought in November 2005, Employer’s Insurer would not have been making any payments after that date at the $410.00 Weekly Compensation Rate between November 2005 and February 2006, nor at the $164.42 rate during the grace period. Moreover, the Bureau does not acknowledge that, at the time of the Third-Party Settlement Agreement, Employer’s Insurer compensated Claimant for the pro rata share of the attorney fees attributable to the prethird-party settlement compensation payments it recouped as a result of the settlement, including compensation payments made both before and after the denial of supersedeas.</p>

Looking to the specific payments, Employer’s Insurer first considers the amount Employer’s Insurer paid in compensation to Claimant after the denial of supersedeas and before the third-party settlement. Employer’s Insurer asserts that there is no question that, at the time of payments, the payments were compensation paid as a result of the denial of supersedeas. Thus, absent the third-party settlement, these payments would have been reimbursable in full from the Fund upon the ultimate grant of supersedeas. Employer’s Insurer notes that a portion of these payments was satisfied through the third-party <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>settlement, but Employer’s Insurer was not reimbursed for the amount equal to the pro rata share of the costs of recovery that was allotted to Claimant from the Third-Party Settlement Agreement. Employer’s Insurer argues that these unreimbursed amounts that were originally paid as compensation are “not converted into attorney fees and costs simply because there was a third-party settlement.” Brief of Employer’s Insurer at 15. It notes that the fact that Employer’s Insurer may have recouped through the Third-Party Settlement Agreement the compensation it paid prior to the denial of supersedeas (which it concedes is not subject to reimbursement) is irrelevant to whether it has been fully reimbursed for the compensation it paid following the denial of supersedeas.</p>

Employer’s Insurer’s amicus, the Pennsylvania Defense Institute (PDI), further elaborates upon Employer’s Insurer’s argument that the payments made during the grace period should be reimbursed as compensation. PDI contends that the grace period payments are made to the claimant during each week when the insurer asserts a credit against its Workers’ Compensation liability for the portion of the third-party settlement, which is considered an advance payment of compensation. PDI argues that the gross method set forth in <em>Pergola </em>“looks to the pro rata share of attorney fees and litigation expense to calculate the amount of compensation payable to claimant during each week when the insurer is entitled to recoup the advance payments of compensation, which were made as a result of the actions of the third-party tort feasor.” Brief of PDI at 13. It further notes that if supersedeas had not been improperly denied, Employer’s Insurer would not have made any payments during the grace period, and thus these payments, just like any other compensation payments made following an improper denial of supersedeas, should be reimbursed to the insurer from the Supersedeas Fund.</p>

Employer’s Insurer contends that it should receive reimbursement for the amounts it paid that had not been previously reimbursed and for the amounts it paid during the grace period because reimbursement is supported by the language of Sections 319 and 443 and there is no language in those sections to the contrary.

Moreover, <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>had there not been a Third-Party Settlement Agreement, the Supersedeas Fund would have been required to reimburse Employer’s Insurer for the full $410.00 weekly payments following the WCJ’s decision to grant supersedeas. As a result of the Third-Party Settlement Agreement, Employer’s Insurer has already been reimbursed a portion of these $410.00 weekly compensation payments from the third-party settlement. We find no language in either Section 443 or Section 319 that would transform the unreimbursed portion of these weekly compensation benefit payments into something other than compensation merely because that portion was deducted in order to compensate the Claimant for the costs of recovering the Third-Party Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the Unreimbursed Pre-Settlement Payments constitute compensation later determined not to have been payable for purposes of reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund under Section 443.</p>
    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[152,1242,1155,949]]]'>We next consider the $164.42 weekly Grace Period Payments made following the Third-Party Settlement Agreement in February 2006 through October 2006. The Bureau relies upon the following statement in <em>Pergola </em>to demonstrate that this Court has viewed payments made during a grace period as other than compensation: “The grace period is the number of weeks in the future for which the employer does not have to pay claimant workers’ compensation benefits.” <em>Pergola, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="701 A.2d 560" data-case-ids="11898760,17759" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0560-01,/pa/549/0490-01">701 A.2d at 563</a>. In contrast to the implication of the Bureau, this Court was not considering whether the payments made during the grace period were or were not “compensation” for purposes of supersedeas under the fifth prong of Section 443, but instead was merely explaining the concept of a grace period. The issue before the Court in <em>Pergola </em>was how to calculate the grace period and whether to use the gross or net method. This Court made no conclusion regarding the categorization of any payments that would be made during the grace period.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[156,2213,1149,149]],["BL_110.1",110,[280,314,1153,837]]]'>In contrast to the Bureau’s attempt to read <em>Pergola </em>to categorize the payments made as “not compensation,” the language of Section 319 is consistent with viewing the Grace <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Period Payments as compensation. Indeed, it instructs that “[a]ny recovery against such third person in excess of the compensation theretofore paid by the employer ... shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future installments of compensation.” 77 P.S. § 671. Given that the statute credits the employer with paying future weekly installments of compensation via the excess recovery, we conclude that the weekly amount actually paid by the employer during the grace period may also be considered reimbursable “compensation” for purposes of Section 443. Such a conclusion complies with Section 443’s intent to ensure that the employer is reimbursed for payments later determined not to be the employer’s responsibility and Section 319’s absolute right to subrogation when the responsibility for the injury lies at the feet of a third-party tortfeasor rather than the employer.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[274,1175,1153,1003]]]'>Moreover, in <em>Pergola, </em>we stated, “Since the legal expenses and future credits portion of Section 319 must be read <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude that Section 319 requires that the employer only needs to reimburse the employee for legal expenses as the employer receives the benefit of the recovery or settlement.” <em>Pergola, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="701 A.2d 560" data-case-ids="11898760,17759" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0560-01,/pa/549/0490-01">701 A.2d at 565</a>. Therefore, if the employer only needs to reimburse the employee for the legal expenses as the employer receives the benefit, it does not make sense that the employer is responsible for the legal expenses attributable to the benefit of not having to pay the compensation during the grace period, if it is later determined that the employer was not, in fact, responsible for paying any compensation during the grace period. Moreover, we find no language in Section 443 that would require us to conclude that payments by the employer/insurer during the grace period of Section 319 are not compensation for purposes of reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund merely because they are calculated based upon the proration of the costs of the third-party recovery.</p>
