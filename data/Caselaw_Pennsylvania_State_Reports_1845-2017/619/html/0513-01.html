Jordan, a/k/a John Lewis (“Appellant”), pled guilty to murder generally in the shooting death of Philadelphia Police Officer Charles Cassidy. Following a trial by jury to determine degree of guilt, Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. In this direct appeal, Appellant raises four issues. Concluding that Appellant is entitled to no relief on any of these issues and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Appellant’s conviction, we-affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

During a period of approximately six weeks in the fall of 2007, Appellant committed six armed robberies of retail food shops in North Philadelphia. Specifically, on September 18, 2007; September 21, 2007; and October 13, 2007, respectively, Appellant robbed three different Dunkin’ Donuts shops at gunpoint. On October 20, 2007, and October 25, 2007, respectively, he robbed two pizza shops at gunpoint. Finally, at approximately 10:30 a.m. on October 31, 2007, Appellant returned to the Dunkin’ Donuts shop that was the site of his first robbery, and again demanded money from the employees at gunpoint. While this final robbery was in progress, Officer Charles Cassidy, who was dressed in his police uniform, parked his car in front of the shop and opened its front door. As the officer was about to enter the shop, Appellant turned toward the officer, took two steps in his direction, pointed a gun at him, and shot him in <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>the forehead at close range. Appellant immediately fled from the scene, stopping to bend over to take the fallen officer’s service revolver. On November 3, 2007, Appellant traveled by bus to Miami, where he was arrested a few days later and then brought back to Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[270,595,1156,1053]]]'>Appellant’s trial began on November 9, 2009. After <em>voir dire </em>but before any testimony had been presented, Appellant pled guilty to the murder of Officer Cassidy, as well as to all six armed robberies. As the court explained to the jury, the trial’s scope had thus been narrowed, such that the only issue left to be determined was whether Appellant had committed first-degree or second-degree murder. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Trial, 11/12/09, at 12. At trial, the Commonwealth presented several eyewitnesses to each of the robberies, as well as a surveillance videotape of the robbery and murder. The final prosecution witness was Officer Cassidy’s widow. Trial counsel’s defense strategy was to argue that Appellant had fired his gun in a “panicky reaction” when Officer Cassidy interrupted the robbery in progress. <em>See id. </em>at 48, 53 (defense opening statement); <em>id., </em>11/19/07, at 36 (defense closing argument). After the Commonwealth rested on November 18, 2009, the defense proffered no evidence and immediately also rested. The next day, following closing arguments and instructions from the court, the jury began its deliberations and within hours found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder.</p>

Officer Cassidy’s adult children and his widow expressed, via letters written to the court, the effects of Officer Cassidy’s death on the family. Appellant presented the testimony of his mother, grandmother, and sister. The jury found three aggravating circumstances, to wit, killing of a peace officer in the performance of his duties, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(1); killing committed during the perpetration of a felony, § 9711(d)(6); and significant history of violent felony convictions, § 9711(d)(9), and one mitigating circumstance, to wit, any other evidence of mitigation, the “catch-all” mitigator, § 9711(e)(8). The jury also found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and ac<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>cordingly determined that Appellant should be sentenced to death.</p>

Commonwealth’s Brief at 14-15 (citing Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2)).

The time, down to the second, at which the camera took the images, appeared as a digital display on the videotape, a fact that the Commonwealth pointed out several times to the jury. N.T. Trial, 11/16/09, at 100-03. The Commonwealth first played the videotape at regular speed, with frequent stops for an eyewitness to testify as to the images caught on the tape. <em>Id. </em>at 94-108. The Commonwealth’s questioning of the witness in conjunction with the showing of the videotape established the following: at 10:30:29, Officer Cassidy was at the door of the shop and Appellant glanced over his shoulder in the officer’s direction; at 10:30:31, Appellant pointed his gun at Officer Cassidy, after having taken a few steps in his direction; and the officer then fell to the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 100-01, 107. At this point in the questioning of the witness, the Commonwealth played the videotape in slow motion without interruption. <em>Id. </em>at 112-13. Later on the same day, the Commonwealth replayed the videotape in real time during the testimony of another eyewitness. <em>Id. </em>at 130-32. During closing argument, the Commonwealth again played the videotape in slow motion, but first emphasized that the crucial portion, <em>ie., </em>from the time that Appellant noticed Officer Cassidy at the Dunkin’ Donuts door until the officer’s murder, encompassed only two seconds. <em>Id., </em>11/19/09, at 88-89. The Commonwealth focused on Appellant’s actions during those two seconds and then argued that his actions were incompatible with his claim of a spontaneous, reflexive “panicky reaction.” <em>Id. </em>at 89-91. Specifically, the Commonwealth argued as follows: “As [defense counsel] said, it is two seconds but it was a sufficient time for [Appellant] to see, to react and that is not an involuntary reaction.... It is an intentional, purposeful act in his case____ It can be a fraction of a second. It was more than that in this case.” <em>Id. </em>at 90-91. During jury deliberations, the court granted the jury’s request to see the surveillance videotape again, both in real time and in slow motion. <em>Id. </em>at 163-67. .</p>

We can discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s determination that the slow-motion videotape could and did aid the jury in observing and evaluating this sequence of events.

    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[264,869,1153,888]]]'>Second, I have a number of concerns respecting appellant’s claim that the trial court erred in admitting victim impact testimony at the guilt phase, specifically the testimony of Judy Cassidy, the widow of Charles Cassidy, the Philadelphia Police Officer whom appellant murdered. At the outset of its analysis, the Majority poses the question as if the claim is that the entirety of Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony was objectionable as victim impact evidence. Majority Op. at 535, 65 A.3d at 331. But, that is not the claim. The Commonwealth did not proffer (or defend) Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony as victim impact evidence, and the court below did not admit it as such. As the Majority later recognizes, Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony was admitted as life-in-being evidence and appellant never disputed, either below or here, that life-in-being testimony is admissible in a murder prosecution; instead, appellant’s claim is that the testimony went beyond life-in-being and encompassed victim impact.

      <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>In resolving the claim, however, the Majority again resorts to a less precise and more absolute approach, apparently concluding that the trial court erred in admitting -the entirety of Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony. This is obviously incorrect; those aspects of Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony encompassing life-in-being were properly admitted, and any error arises only from those aspects implicating victim impact. The job of policing the line between evidence of life-in-being and victim impact testimony obviously falls within the discretion of the trial court. The Majority’s inaccurate reframing of the issue necessarily recasts its review of the exercise of the trial court’s discretion. Mrs. Cassidy’s testimony in fact was. admitted by the court as life-in-being evidence. Appellant’s preserved claim that the evidence digressed from life-in-being into victim impact does not alter the purpose for which the evidence was presented and admitted; it is, rather, an objection premised upon speculation at what the jury might do with evidence that was offered for life-in-being purposes but strayed beyond that purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> This is a much narrower point. If the entirety of Mrs. Cassidy’s evidence was both irrelevant and harmless, as the Majority says, then the mere victim impact aspects of the testimony obviously were not prejudicial.</p>

When Officer Cassidy walked into a coffee shop on the morning of October 31, 2007 and unwittingly happened upon a robbery in progress, he was a person, a human being. He was neither an abstraction nor a mere prop for the future trial of the man who — caught on tape — ambushed and murdered him. Under settled and logical authority, evidence of his life-in-being is admissible at trial.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[267,1076,1156,729]]]'>In this case, the Commonwealth pursued capital murder charges, and when appellant pled guilty to committing the murder “generally,” he did not acknowledge guilt of first-degree murder; his plea was strategic (and no doubt wise, given the videotape). Instead, appellant focused on defeating a verdict of first-degree murder or, failing that (as was likely, given the evidence), creating a platform for a penalty phase case in mitigation premised upon acceptance of responsibility. When the defendant insists that the Commonwealth carry its burden to establish the degree of murder to the jury, I do not believe that defense pleading strategy controls the Commonwealth’s ability to present its case in full. This case was about murder, so it necessarily encompassed the prior existence of Officer Cassidy.</p>

Similarly, we have recognized that, “a criminal defendant does not have the right to have all evidence presented against him at trial sanitized of anything that could cause jurors to sympathize with the victim or his family.” <em>Commonwealth v. Rios, </em><a href="/pa/591/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="591 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="3014692" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0583-01">591 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/pa/591/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="920 A.2d 790" data-case-ids="3014692,8325303" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0583-01,/a2d/920/0790-01">920 A.2d 790</a>, 807 (2007). Indeed, the fact that a person has been killed is rarely challenged in a murder prosecution. And, even aside from the partial guilty plea scenario, in cases where there is a dead body and proof of criminal agency, it costs a defendant nothing to admit or stipulate that the victim has died. I do not believe that pleas or stipulations to the fact of the victim’s death render life-in-being testimony irrelevant. Certainly, the trial court, in its discretion, can rein in and channel the Commonwealth’s proof. Nevertheless, evidence going to elements of the crime placed before the jury is not inadmissible, even if certain of the elements are strategically uncontested.</p>
