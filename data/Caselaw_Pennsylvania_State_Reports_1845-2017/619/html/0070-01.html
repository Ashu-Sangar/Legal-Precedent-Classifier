The assaults occurred at about 11:00 p.m. at the intersection of Franklin and Indiana Streets in North Philadelphia and were carried out by means of AK-47 assault rifles. Vargas, a drug dealer, was pronounced dead at the scene from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, and chest that he suffered while sitting in his car. Carrasquilla, who was speaking with Vargas through Vargas’s car window at the time she was shot, died a short time later from at least one gunshot wound to her back.</p>

The meeting entailed a discussion of killing Vargas, who had recently shot one of Pagan’s dealers, Carlos Robelos. Robelos vowed to kill Vargas in revenge, and Pagan told Robelos that he would pay Robelos for killing Vargas. Robelos then enlisted appellee to help him kill Vargas. Shortly thereafter, when reports came that Vargas was in the area, Pagan provided appellee and Robelos with AK-47 rifles, pistols, , and ski masks to wear during the attack. After the murders, appellee and Robelos each received $2,500 from Pagan.</p>

This evaluation was conducted by psychologist Albert Levitt. Dr. Levitt’s original handwritten notes include the phrase “mental retard mild.” Dr. Levitt, Handwritten Notes, 7/10/98, at 1. Dr. Levitt’s final report did not indicate retardation. Instead, the report summarized appellee’s youth and background, including appellee’s recollections that he began smoking marijuana daily when he was 14 years old and using cocaine and PCP regularly at 16 years old. Appellee recalled being in juvenile facilities during his teenage years, which Dr. Levitt supplemented with information that appellee’s first experience with the juvenile system occurred in 1991, when appellee, who was born in April 1979, would have been approximately 12 years old; he was placed on probation for simple and aggravated assault. Appellee also committed simple and aggravated assault in 1994 and was adjudicated delinquent in 1996 for carrying a firearm. Appellee was then placed in the “Vision Quest” program (which will be further discussed infra). Dr. Levitt’s report stated that appellee had poor judgment, auditory hallucinations, “paranoid and morbid thought processes,” and “inappropriate assumptions.” Dr. <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>Levitt’s psychological assessment was of poly-substance abuse, with a secondary diagnosis of “schizotypal personality with aggressive anti-social tendencies.” Dr. Levitt concluded that appellee did not suffer from major mental illness and that despite appellee’s “poor emotional condition and background,” he was “capable of understanding a sentencing procedure.” Dr. Levitt Report, 7/30/98, at 1-3.</p>

Appellee presented a multitude of witnesses: mental health experts, family members, childhood acquaintances, and school teachers and counselors. The mental health experts testified to various aspects of mental retardation and their opinions that appellee fit the clinical criteria for the condition. Dr. Antonio Puente, a psychologist, opined that appellee fell “smack in the middle of the mild mental retardation range” within both the AAMR<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and DSM-IV<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> standards, and that it would be “difficult to fake” his performance on IQ tests. Dr. Puente also believed that appellee’s mental deficits most likely manifested before he turned eighteen. On cross-examination, the prosecutor contrasted the potential effects of appellee’s teenage drug use when compared with his earlier school records, which indicated intelligence and natural leadership; the prosecutor also <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>noted the absence of any suggestion of mental retardation in appellee’s post-incarceration <em>pre-Atkins </em>records and evaluation reports, such as the pre-sentence report from 1999 in this case. Dr. Puente conceded that drug use may have “played a role” in appellee’s academic decline and that it was difficult to reconcile appellee’s positive early school achievements, particularly in math, where he tested in the ninetieth percentile three times, with a diagnosis of mental retardation. N.T., <em>Atkins </em>Hearing, 10/23/06, at 49, 51, 77, 79, 131, 149-56, 171, 176, 189-98, <em>&amp; </em>205-14.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[271,851,1157,1159]]]'>Gerald Cooke, Ph.D., also a psychologist, opined that appellee was mentally retarded, with an overall IQ of 61 and intellectual and adaptive deficits that would have manifested before he turned 18. Although Dr. Cooke understood that someone could “fake an IQ test,” he believed that appellee “was exerting effort, that he was trying to do well” and that the distribution of appellee’s responses (he did relatively well on easier questions and worse on more difficult questions) suggested that appellee was not “faking mental retardation.” Dr. Cooke added that the Slosson Intelligence test, which appellee took in 1991, 1994, and 1996 (coinciding with his experiences in the juvenile system), and on which he received scores of 84, 109, and 99, above the range of mental retardation, was no longer viewed as a valid IQ indicator. Dr. Cooke stated that from his experience in the juvenile and criminal justice systems, he believed that less intelligent individuals were often recruited for menial positions within organized drug groups, such as “mules,” “enforcers,” or low-level sellers. Dr. Cooke opined that appellee’s level of intelligence, competence, and lack of self-direction was consistent with that type of activity.

According to Dr. Cooke, appellee’s low level of mental “sophistication” seemed inconsistent with the sort of purposeful deception and strategy required to fabricate testimony of a <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>crime committed by another person. Nevertheless, Dr. Cooke felt that appellee’s current testing results indicated that “basically, [appellee] is now a 27-year-old adult reading and doing arithmetic at the level of a third to fourth grader” and that he was not “malingering” when tested. Dr. Cooke did not assign much value to appellee’s positive evaluations from “Vision Quest,” an alternative juvenile residential program.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Dr. Cooke related that he had often heard that Vision Quest inflated reports and results and even provided answers to make the program appear more effective than it was. On cross-examination, Dr. Cooke conceded that appellee knew why he was being evaluated and that the results could affect his efforts to overturn his death sentence: “Well, on the face of it, you would think somebody would want to do badly under those circumstances, but that is not what I saw.” Dr. Cooke acknowledged that nothing in the pre-incarceration evidence on appellee suggested an IQ below 70 and also that prior to <em>Atkins, </em>only one notation, had been made that appellee might suffer from mental retardation (Dr. Levitt’s 1998 handwritten note mentioned above). Dr. Cooke expressed skepticism that appellee’s purportedly false testimony in the German Cruz ease revealed significant intelligence; he was similarly ambivalent with regard to statements appellee evidently made about being able to independently acquire plane tickets and travel to and from Puerto Rico.

Dr. Olley focused on appellee’s adaptive behavior, which refers to judgment, self-control, communications with others, and problem-solving. Dr. Olley testified that a background of poverty may be a factor leading to mental retardation or other developmental delays, due in part to poor nutrition, medical care, and edu<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>cational screening and opportunities. On cross-examination, Dr. Olley opined that the simpler aspects of appellee’s allegedly false testimony in the Cruz case could be managed by a mentally retarded person, but that other aspects of the testimony, such as recall and retelling of the details of drug trading and the actual crimes, might not be consistent with mental retardation. Dr. Olley also conceded that appellee’s early teenage drug use could have been a factor leading to his increased criminal activity and his decline at school. Dr. Olley believed that appellee was “trying his best to answer my questions within his ability,” but admitted that appellee had an incentive to do poorly on an <em>Atkins </em>evaluation.

Dr. Russell added that a spread of over 20 points, like appellee’s, suggested that some problem occurred with either the administration of the prior tests or the calculation of the results. Dr. Russell added that in his general experience with the juvenile system, where appellee may have taken those tests, counselors were often overwhelmed by the volume of evaluations, which could have affected accuracy. Moreover, Dr. Russell stated that to the extent Slosson results may still be viewed as effective, they are seen as likely to overstate a subject’s IQ.

Dr. Davis testified that Vision Quest was viewed as a positive program in an outdoor rural setting that focused on discipline, life skills, cooperation with others, and behavior modification. In Dr. Davis’s opinion, one of Vision Quest’s weaknesses was the failure to provide consistent therapy and education along with its activities and programs. Dr. Davis believed that participants’ improvements “on paper” at Vision Quest were often exagger<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>ated and did not comport with what she observed when participants returned to the juvenile or school systems.

Dr. Delfín did not necessarily believe that appellee’s false testimony in the German Cruz matter was inconsistent with mild mental retardation and speculated that it could have been the result of good “coaching.” On cross-examination, Dr. Delfín testified that while appellee’s early positive school results may have been consistent, they were not necessarily accurate or reliable and that appellee’s subsequent academic decline was likely because he had reached the upper level of his intellectual capacity.

In Dr. Denkowski’s opinion, the only “constant” in appellee’s test scores was his inconsistent, even poor, performance and effort. Moving to appellee’s adaptive abilities, Dr. Denkowski critiqued the results of the test given by Dr. Olley on grounds that appellee’s score of 27 was so low that if it were accurate, appellee would be so severely retarded that it would be “glaringly obvious even to laypeople.” Dr. Denkowski explained that testers must distinguish whether a subject is capable of performing well, but chooses not to, and whether the subject simply does not have the mental capacity to perform well; in Dr. Denkowski’s view, this reality introduces subjectivity into what is thought of as “objective” testing. In terms of adaptive functioning, Dr. Denkowski placed less weight on anecdotal evidence of appel<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>lee’s inability to tie his shoes and more weight on appellee’s pre-incarceration ability to navigate his neighborhood, purchase things, conduct drug business by renting corners, have girlfriends, give presents, leave tips, and similar social skills.

Dr. Denkowski deduced that appellee was far from being a follower and felt that appellee was, in fact, “extremely self-directed. He is highly independent. No one is going to tell him what to do.” Dr. Denkowski opined that appellee’s testimony in the Cruz proceedings was too interactive, detail-oriented, and intelligible to be that of a mentally retarded person. Dr. Denkowski also questioned Dr. Olley’s results from testing appellee’s “receptive language” skills, such as understanding what one is being told, and “expressive language” skills, such as being able to speak and communicate with others. Dr. Olley had scored appellee more than twice as high on expressive skills (at the level of a ten-year-old child) as on receptive skills (at the level of a four-year-old child). In Dr. Denkowski’s view, such incompatibility is nearly impossible because expressive skills are more difficult and it would be rare for them to so greatly outstrip receptive skills, indicating, at the least, something askew with the intake information. Further noting that Dr. Olley’s results were based largely on appellee’s cousin Minerva Rivera’s reporting, Dr. Denkowski opined: “What it indicates to me is that there was an active effort to portray [appellee] as being impaired and she just didn’t know how to do it, so she came up with these unusual score patterns.... ” Dr. Denkowski also indicated that he did not believe that appellee’s voluntary drug use would have resulted in the sort of enduring brain change or damage that would lead to mental retardation.

Dr. Denkowski attributed the disparity in appellee’s Slosson test scores from the 1990s (84, 109, and 99) to the likelihood that appellee’s effort varied, which affected his results.

Dr. Denkowski explained that the adaptive ability test he used is meant to measure individuals within a “mainstream social lifestyle” and not within “the criminal socio-culture,” where motivation and lifestyle have different effects.

The Commonwealth posits that the standard “as is,” in a sense, rewards killers, who make the ultimate anti-social choice to commit murder, with immunity from the death penalty on a showing based upon pre-incarceration criminal choices and lifestyle.

A more stringent burden of proof imposes on a party a higher risk of an erroneous decision. In a criminal proceeding, an allocation of risk complies with due process “unless it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” Generally, in examining state burdens of proof, the High Court gives “substantial deference” to procedures grounded in the com<a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>mon law tradition, weighs their impact on “any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in operation” and, to a lesser extent, gives consideration to contemporary practice.</blockquote>

The <em>Atkins </em>Court recognized the inherent and practical difficulties of determining which offenders are in fact retarded. While we do not believe that the difficulty of the inquiry alone mandates a low probative threshold, given the presumptions favoring life built into Pennsylvania’s capital sentencing scheme, we perceive no basis for allocating to the capital defendant the larger share of risk that accompanies burdens of proof more onerous than a preponderance of the evidence. Also, in this Commonwealth, this degree of proof generally comports with that of defendants on whom the burden is placed to prove their affirmative defenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 315(a) (insanity defense); 18 Pa.C.S. § 313(b) (entrapment defense).</blockquote>

We think it unlikely in the extreme that if the High Court were to devise a national standard, it would much deviate from that which the Court identified as “the clinical definitions” in <em>Atkins. </em>Unlike the States that provided the consensus that powered the <em>Atkins </em>decision, Pennsylvania did not previously exempt a class of competent murderers from operation of the most severe penalty based upon mental retardation. Although the High Court did not command that the definitions and model it cited were required to satisfy the Eighth Amendment, for a Court tasked with discerning a standard that would pass federal constitutional muster, and in the absence of legislative guidance, the logical starting point obviously is to look to that model. We have done so consistently, from <em>Mitchell </em>through <em>Sanchez.</em>

Although <em>Atkins </em>determinations are couched in objective clinical terms — limited intellectual functioning, significant adaptive limitations, and onset prior to 18 years of age — the proof is often highly subjective, whether provided by mental health experts or lay persons. Indeed, the fact that mental health experts can draw contrary conclusions from the same set of circumstances, particularly where little pre-conviction record evidence is available, shows the difficulty with such determinations. That difficulty is only exacerbated in a case like appellee’s, where no clinical diagnosis of mental retardation was made prior to age 18, and his claim of mental retardation is forwarded strictly in the context <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>of seeking relief under <em>Atkins, </em>where there is a powerful incentive to malinger and to slant evidence.</p>

Having said that, we are not inclined to elevate such considerations to any particular favored or presumptive status, or to expressly instruct courts to treat all retrospective test results with particular caution. The fact remains that there may be some murderers who indeed are mentally retarded, even if the condition went undiagnosed prior to age 18, and prior to the defendant being found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. The <em>Atkins </em>factfinder should sort through all relevant evidence and arguments, including logical arguments premised upon perceived incentives, and make the necessary determination. Notably, in the case at bar, the PCRA court did not simply ignore or discount the Commonwealth’s argument concerning malingering; the court in fact believed that the Commonwealth’s evidence and argument that appellee malingered on his <em>post-Atkins </em>tests was “compelling”; the court concluded, however, that such evidence ultimately did not “carry the day.”</p>

The second and third, regarding impulsive behavior and leadership, tie to the <em>Atkins </em>note that the retarded “often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.” The fourth, regarding rational actions and social propriety, ties to the <em>Atkins </em>discussion of “understanding] the reactions of others.” The fifth, regarding focused responses to questions, evokes the <em>Atkins </em>discussion of “diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate.... ” The sixth, concerning the ability to deceive, seems related to Atkins’s mention of “capacity] to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning....” And the seventh, involving forethought and planning, seems tied to Atkins’s mention of action “pursuant to a premeditated plan.” The <em>Briseno </em>factors thus are not arbitrary creations of the Texas judiciary but rather carefully constructed considerations that tie directly to <em>Atkins.</em>

The parties here assume that an abuse of discretion standard applies in this <em>PCRAJAtkins </em>context. Not surprisingly given that the <em>Atkins </em>decision is new and presumably affects few cases, this Court has not addressed the question of whether and when a PCRA court making an <em>Atkins </em>determination should entertain newly-discovered evidence. Nor do the Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically address this question. That is not to say that the Rules provide no guidance, however. Rule 905 provides that amendment to PCRA petitions “shall be freely allowed to achieve substantial justice.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(A). The Rules <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>contemplate the same leeway for answers to PCRA petitions: “The judge may grant the Commonwealth leave to amend the answer at any time, and amendment shall be freely allowed to achieve substantial justice.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 906(E)(3) (governing answers in death penalty cases); <em>accord </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 906(D) (same substance, governing answers in other cases).

At the defendant’s jury trial, he sought to present two psychiatrists to testify that he was in a state of cocaine-induced psychosis at the time of the murder, and therefore was unable to form the specific intent to kill necessary for first-degree murder. The first expert testified in the defense case-in-chief, describing toxic psychosis and opining that the defendant was suffering from the condition at the time of the murder. However, the second expert did not arrive until after the defense had rested and the Commonwealth’s rebuttal expert had already been examined.

This Court upheld the trial court’s ruling, as follows: “[The first expert] covered in his testimony the information which, apparently, the defense had planned for [the second expert to] cover____We thus find no clear abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in refusing to permit the defense to reopen its case-in-chief.” <a href="/a2d/694/1086-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="694 A.2d 1086" data-case-ids="11989191,11989370,960541,960583" data-case-paths="/a2d/694/1086-01,/a2d/694/1086-02,/pa/548/0064-01,/pa/548/0065-01">694 A.2d at 1091</a>.</p>

In <em>Tharp, </em>the defendant was charged with rape, indecent assault, and corruption of a minor, which requires the perpetrator to be at least 18 years old. At trial, the Commonwealth presented circumstantial evidence of appellant’s age to the jury: he was in a Delaware County bar drinking alcohol (at least 21 years old) and had driven without an adult after midnight (at least 18 years old) on the night of the crimes. After the Commonwealth closed its case-in-chief, the defense sought to have the corruption charge dropped as insufficiently supported by evidence of the defendant’s age. The Commonwealth moved to reopen its case to present direct evidence of the defendant’s age. The trial court granted the motion. This Court found no abuse of discretion because it was understandable why the Commonwealth might believe that direct evidence of age was unnecessary under the circumstances, and once the defendant broached the issue, it was appropriate to allow the Commonwealth to reopen, “to avoid the possibility of a result inconsistent with the true facts.” <a href="/pa/525/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="525 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1823767" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0094-01">575 A.2d at 559</a>. <em>See also Commonwealth v.

This case involves a collateral attack with a judicial factfinder, not a jury trial where newly discovered or proffered evidence can be disruptive. The Commonwealth’s motion was forwarded before the trial court had rendered its ultimate decision, and it related to a matter where the court had already held twelve days of testimony, and there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth failed to forward the motion in a timely fashion. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/4/07 (argument on Commonwealth’s motion to reopen). The issue before the court was a novel one — novel since <em>Atkins </em>itself was and is novel; the question was posed in a case where no diagnosis of mental retardation had been made in appellee’s youth prior to age 18; the issue was difficult to establish definitively on either side, and the Commonwealth’s proffer implicated, in part, very practical questions concerning the elements of an <em>Atkins </em>determination.</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[267,1178,1154,1172]],["BL_181.1",181,[150,314,1150,194]]]'>The Commonwealth’s proffer specified that this evidence was relevant to the intellectual and adaptive function elements of <em>Atkins </em>because it showed appellee’s ability, not only to function within prison, but to use his wits and skills to “beat the system” in a manner that required forethought, direction and coordination of others. The evidence also reflected the type of sophisticated thinking <em>(e.g., </em>the idea to smuggle a cell phone onto death row inside the spine of a hardback dictionary) that belied the defense’s portrayal of appellee as an individual challenged since childhood to accomplish the most basic tasks of life, and who then grew up to become, at best, a mentally limited foot soldier or enforcer within his drug gang. The Commonwealth also proffers newly-obtained evidence that allegedly demonstrates appellee’s relatively sophisticated intellectual and adaptive functioning in other respects, primarily correspondence between appellee and a woman who assisted him in securing the cellphones. The Commonwealth added in its motion that appellee also successfully held a job in prison and independently managed the funds in his prison bank account. The new evidence was proffered to show that at the very time appellee claimed mental retardation, he was, in fact, highly functional and intelligent enough not only to survive <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>within the prison system, but also, <em>inter alia, </em>to circumvent the security and discipline of death row by acquiring, using, and keeping a cell phone until it was discovered and confiscated.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.4",181,[152,540,1155,1110]]]'>We have no doubt that the Commonwealth’s evidence implicates both appellee’s intellectual functioning and his adaptive skills. Thus, for example, if the evidence of appellee’s recent activities in prison is proven and credited, it rather obviously is probative of these two <em>Atkins </em>factors — as is the evidence, if proven and credited, that appellee lied to the Commonwealth’s expert, Dr. Denkowski. Nor do we believe that the evidence can fairly be described as merely cumulative of what was already heard. Moreover, given the extensive and overlapping presentation appellee made concerning his childhood, it would be strange to suggest that this evidence could be viewed as merely cumulative. Appellee’s counsel presented lay -witnesses who provided a retrospective and anecdotal look at appellee’s adaptive abilities in his childhood and in his youth, supplemented by testimony from six mental health experts, none of whom had had contact with appellee prior to appellee’s petition seeking <em>Atkins </em>relief, much less contact with appellee when he was under the age of 18. The importance of the evidence now proffered is, in some regards, a function of the difficult nature of a retrospective <em>Atkins </em>inquiry.</p>

As we have noted earlier, it can hardly be disputed that the subjective aspects of the <em>Atkins </em>inquiry, and the obvious motivation to malinger and to slant evidence, are such that manipulation is always a possibility. Relatively contemporaneous demonstrations of intelligence and ability contrary to the defense presentation, and admissions of deception and malingering — all matters requiring competent, credited proof — should be subject to development when timely uncovered. If proven, this- evidence of demonstrated recent <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>abilities obviously is a powerful counterpoint to evidence concerning appellee’s childhood and his supposed continuing intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits.</p>

The new evidence concerns his own conduct; the evidence is subject to appropriate challenges upon remand; and the purpose of the remand is to merely ensure a more complete picture for the PCRA court so that it may render a definitive judgment which achieves substantial justice. Also weighing in favor of entertaining the evidence is the fact that the PCRA court itself later recognized that the <em>Atkins </em>question was a close one.</p>

As explained above, we do not view the Commonwealth’s proffered new evidence, concerning appellee’s actions in prison, as merely cumulative of the evidence already presented. By contrast, ensuring proper and thorough review of all of the available evidence, at a proceeding where both sides will have the full opportunity to challenge and refute each other’s presentations, will “avoid the possibility of a result inconsistent with the true facts.” <em>Tharp, </em><a href="/pa/525/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="525 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1823767" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0094-01">575 A.2d at 559</a>.

Given this background, appellee's suggestion that assigning the defendant a heightened level of proof would violate the federal Constitution is unpersuasive. There is no existing authority from the U.S. Supreme Court imposing such a restriction, albeit some lower courts have expressed concerns with a heightened standard of proof. <em>See Sanchez, </em><a href="/pa/613/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="36 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="4205851,4207029,7295141,7295171" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0639-01,/pa/614/0001-01,/a3d/36/0024-01,/a3d/36/0024-02">36 A.3d at </a>69-70 &amp; n. 23. Since we reaffirm the preponderance standard here, for the reasons we develop in the text below, we need not speculate whether we believe the U.S. Supreme Court would disapprove of a different, heightened burden.</p>

The evidence in question was obtained by the Commonwealth as fruits of a search warrant. The evidence was subsequently submitted in grand jury proceedings which were ongoing as the PCRA petition was pending below. Upon the Commonwealth's petition, this Court granted leave to file supplemental briefs, including copies of the evidence, under <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>seal. Since the evidence was not itself a product of the grand jury investigation, its consideration is appropriate here, to assess the Commonwealth's proffer.</p>

The Commonwealth adds that in one call, appellee spoke about "that thing I want to get”; appellee also told his mother that he was sending her $300 from his prison account, with $50 for a friend and the remainder for "you know[,] for that.” Three days later, the Commonwealth asserts, $300 was deducted from appellee's prison account. In a subsequent phone call, appellee’s mother confirmed that the money had been received, $50 had been distributed to the friend, and she would keep the remainder until receiving "new instructions” from appellee. The Commonwealth posits that this evidence demonstrates that appellee had the intelligence to concoct a scheme to get the phone, and also had far more ability to understand and manage money than his <em>Atkins </em>witnesses had claimed.

In <em>Miller, </em>part of the Commonwealth's effort to refute the defendant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim was its assertion that "even Appellee believed that the PCRA court favored him, as, in another recorded prison telephone call, he mused that if the PCRA judge were removed from the case, he would surely be put to death.” <a href="/pa/597/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="951 A.2d 322" data-case-ids="3925137,8212515" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0333-01,/a2d/951/0322-01">951 A.2d at 327</a>. The PCRA court ultimately found in the defendant’s favor; this Court affirmed the court’s order vacating the defendant's death sentences and also concluded that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Commonwealth’s motion seeking recusal.</p>
