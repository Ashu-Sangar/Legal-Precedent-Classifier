Finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s request to testify on his own behalf, after the evidentiary phase of the trial was closed, and after he waived such right the previous day, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b240-9" data-blocks='[["BL_240.8",240,[274,1221,1152,678]]]'>On January 25, 2006, appellant and his roommate, Brendan Martin, had an altercation when appellant served Martin with a notice to vacate the premises due to Martin’s drug use. Martin attempted to hit appellant with a hammer, and appellant attacked Martin with a large knife, fatally stabbing him in the neck and heart. Appellant dismembered the body, placed the parts in five plastic bags, and buried the remains in a shallow, makeshift grave. The next day, a road department employee discovered the grave and alerted police, who found the plastic bags containing the victim’s remains, along with a backpack containing a piece of paper with appellant’s name on it. Police interviewed appellant, who admitted he attacked the victim and killed him.</p>

During the Commonwealth’s casein-chief, appellant indicated he wanted to speak with the court and was told he needed to address the court through his attorney. After discussion was held off the record, appellant’s counsel informed the court, on the record, that appellant wanted to exert a right of allocution to the jury; counsel indicated he <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>told appellant legal procedure did not permit him to do so, and if appellant wished to address the jury, he would have to take the stand and be subject to cross-examination. Counsel and the court acknowledged appellant would have time to discuss with his attorney whether he wished to take the stand, and there would be a colloquy by the court concerning appellant’s right to testify after the Commonwealth rested its case. <em>See </em>N.T.

Counsel further inquired when the court wished to conduct the colloquy concerning appellant’s waiver of his right to testify. The trial court responded it would probably conduct the colloquy immediately prior to the close of the defense’s case, as appellant could change his mind regarding testifying up until the defense rested. <em>See id., </em>at 252-53. After the defense expert testified, the trial court conducted a colloquy with appellant, outside the presence of the jury, concerning his right to testify, as follows:</p>

The Superior Court reiterated, throughout its decision, it was evaluating the trial court’s exercise of its discretion. <em>See Baldwin, </em>at 901 (“[W]e hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion....”); <em>id., </em>at 903 (reopening case “is within the discretion of the trial judge ... ”); <em>id., </em>at 910 (“[W]e may disturb the determinations of the trial court only if there is an abuse of [ ] discretion.”); <em>id. </em>(“In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion ...”); <em>id., </em>at 911 (appellate court cannot condemn trial court’s ruling “as an abuse of direction” simply because it might have reached different conclusion); <em>id. </em>(“[W]e cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion----”); <em>id. </em>(“[T]he matter of whether to reopen for submission of additional testimony is left to the discretion of the trial court.”); <em>id. </em>(“Having discerned no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in this case, we affirm.... ”). It is clear the court recognized the appropriate standard of review.</p>

All of these factors, such as the timing of the request to open, the nature of the proffered testimony, and the reason for the party’s failure to present such evidence during its case-in-chief, are things a trial court would automatically consider in deciding whether reopening the case is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The relative weight of the proffered testimony against the potential for disruption or prejudice, as well as the reasonableness of the party’s excuse for failing to present such evidence sooner, are not new considerations for the trial court; these are common sense factors in deciding whether a case should be reopened. <em>See United States v. Byrd, </em><a href="/f3d/403/1278-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="403 F.3d 1278" data-case-ids="9022219" data-case-paths="/f3d/403/1278-01">403 F.3d 1278</a>, 1283 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (noting in past decisions concerning whether to reopen evidence, “we reviewed for an abuse of discretion without providing a frame<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>work for our analysis”; concluding <em>Walker </em>factors are “helpful in assessing whether the [trial] court abused its discretion ____”). Thus, the <em>Peterson </em>analysis is not a new test, but a helpful framework for the existing abuse of discretion test.</p>
    <p id="b254-6" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[273,547,1154,777]]]'>Appellant contends that application of these factors in cases where the defendant is the party seeking to reopen results in an inequitable burden on defendants. We note <em>Peterson </em>involved the same situation as here: the defendant was the party making the request. However, the same abuse of discretion standard applies to the Commonwealth when it is the requesting party — the <em>Peterson </em>analysis merely elaborates on considerations already present in the trial court’s exercise of its discretion. While the factors bearing on the exercise of discretion may reflect the distinct nature of prosecution or defense, the standard itself is the same. We cannot conclude a defendant bears a more onerous burden when requesting to reopen a case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The same factors apply to either party making the request, and there is not a more stringent standard for defendants.</p>

We conclude the record supports the relevant <em>Peterson </em>factors for the Superior Court to have upheld the trial court’s refusal to reopen the record. As the Superior Court noted, following its review of the extensive colloquy wherein appellant waived his right to testify, “[I]t was clear that [a]ppellant wanted the opportunity to make a statement to the court and jury without being subject to cross-examination.” <em>Baldwin, </em>at 909.

After consulting with appellant, trial counsel relayed the following message:</p>
    <blockquote id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[196,556,1109,260]]]'>TRIAL COUNSEL: Your Honor, just for the record, <em>he wanted to exert a right of allocution to the jury. </em>And I told him that’s not in our legal procedure, that he would have to take the stand and be subject to cross-examination.

    <p id="b255-7" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[155,934,1156,1124]]]'>Thus, the fact the exact content of appellant’s purported testimony is not in the record is of no moment; it is apparent from the record that he wanted to address the jury without being subject to cross-examination, in an attempt to corroborate his expert’s testimony regarding his insanity. <em>See Baldwin, </em>at 910 (citing Appellant’s Brief, at 33). Such self-serving monologues are not permitted at trial, and appellant cannot hide his desire to bend the rules behind the cloak of the right to testify. The right is not without parameters, and cannot be used as a vehicle for a defendant to obviate the rules of trial procedure and evidence. <em>See Jermyn, </em>at 78 (“We have never held, however, that our constitution confers upon criminal defendants an unfettered right of self-expression in the courtroom during the guilt-determination phase of trial. Rather, the right to be heard is, as always, circumscribed by the rules of evidence.”) (citation omitted)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>; <em>see also Baldwin, </em>at 910 .(“Appellant’s right to testify consists of the [ajppellant, like any other witness, testifying under oath by answering questions designed to elicit relevant facts.”). Accordingly, the Superior Court correctly concluded the likely value of appellant’s proposed testimony was questionable.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.3",256,[274,319,1156,1627]]]'>
      <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>Likewise, we agree with the Superior Court’s conclusion that the potential for disruption or prejudice in the proceedings outweighed any value appellant’s testimony may have had. Appellant had rested his case in the presence of the jury, and the Commonwealth had called its rebuttal witness and then rested. The jury had been dismissed for the day, and the trial court had begun to discuss jury instructions with the parties. By the time appellant reneged on his decision to waive his right to testify — the next morning before the jury was brought in — the trial court had prepared its points for charge, all witnesses had been dismissed, and the court was ready for counsel to make closing arguments to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> To disrupt the proceedings at that point to accommodate appellant’s request to unilaterally express himself before the jury would have been potentially confusing to the jury. Every trial must have a conclusion, and the trial court properly exercised its discretion in deciding there had been ample time for appellant to make his decision about whether to testify, and it was time to move forward, particularly when the proffered “testimony” did not fit within the prescribed parameters of trial procedure. There was also potential for prejudice to the Commonwealth, as appellant’s request came after its rebuttal witnesses had been released. See <em>Byrd, </em>at 1287 (“[I]t would have been ‘untenable’ to allow [the defendant] to wait until the government’s witnesses had been released and then take the stand and ‘say whatever he want[ed] to without much fear of anybody being around to rebut it.’ ”). We can but speculate what further rebuttal may have been called for in response to the statement/testimony, in addition to the delay, expense, confusion, and disruption necessarily associated therewith.</p>
