Appellant, a corporation organized under Maryland law, with headquarters in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P.H. Glatfelter Corporation (“Parent”). Parent, a Pennsylva<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>nia corporation, the headquarters of which are in York, Pennsylvania, owns and operates a paper mill in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, where it produces a variety of specialty paper products. Appellant’s sole business activity is to procure pulpwood<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for Parent’s operations, at the lowest possible cost, from two sources, <em>i.e., </em>by growing trees on and harvesting trees from Appellant’s own timberland, or by purchasing pulpwood from third parties on the open market. As of January 1, 2003, Appellant’s timberland holdings were as follows: 25,821 acres in Maryland; 19,249 acres in Delaware; 28,595 acres in Pennsylvania; and 40,682 acres in Virginia. As part of its ongoing management practices for these timber-lands, Appellant hires employees and independent contractors to plant, thin, and harvest timber and to monitor soil and water quality in order to maximize sustainable pulpwood yields. Except for isolated and unpredictable transactions, Appellant sells to Parent all the pulpwood procured, for use at Parent’s Pennsylvania paper mill. Appellant reports all income generated by its pulpwood sales to Parent in Pennsylvania as apportionable business income.</p>
    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[161,1397,1151,473]]]'>In 2003, Appellant made a strategic corporate decision to sell certain of its timberland holdings, thereby decreasing the percentage of pulpwood procured for Parent from Appellant’s timberlands. In 2004, as part of its timberland divestiture plan, Appellant sold 4,882 of its 19,249 Delaware acres for $56,586,000, realizing a net gain of $55,355,452. Appellant distributed all of the net proceeds from this sale to Parent, which used the distributed proceeds to pay down debt and to pay dividends to its shareholders.</p>

In its initial 2004 Pennsylvania corporate tax report, Appellant reported a corporate net income tax liability of $2,189,876, which it paid. Subsequently, Appellant filed an amended 2004 Pennsylvania corporate tax report asserting that its reported net gain on the 2004 Delaware timberland sale should have been considered as non-business income allocated to Delaware. Therefore, Appellant claimed, it actually suffered a net loss of $3,044,914 for the tax year, and its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax liability was zero. On settlement of the 2004 tax year, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (hereinafter “Department”) declined to characterize Appellant’s net gain from the Delaware timberland sale as non-business income, and concluded that Appellant’s 2004 business income was $52,327,343. The Department attributed 42% of Appellant’s income to Pennsylvania and, accordingly, assessed Appellant’s corporate net income tax liability at $2,205,211.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant then filed an appeal with the Board of Finance and Revenue (hereinafter “BF &amp; R”), again requesting that the gain from the timberland sale be considered as non-business' income.

Appellant’s Brief at 13, 28, 34. In Appellant’s view, the sale of the Delaware timberland was a partial liquidation of that aspect of its business involving the growth, maintenance, and harvest of its own pulpwood. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Appellant relies on <em>Laurel Pipe, supra, </em>to support its general contention that “business income does not include gain from the sale of an asset where the taxpayer liquidates a unique aspect of its business (such as the Timberland Holdings) and the proceeds are not reinvested in the taxpayer’s regular business operations.” Appellant’s Reply Brief at 4; <em>see also id. </em>at 3; Appellant’s Brief at 23-31, 34-35.

In addition, Appellee argues that Appellant’s reliance on <em>Laurel Pipe </em>is misplaced because the definition of business income has been amended in a highly relevant manner since that case was decided.

The timberlands served a “hedging” function against risk associated with decreased availability or increased cost of pulpwood on the open market. As part of Appellant’s business activities, Appellant extensively managed its timberlands, hiring employees or third-party contractors to plant, thin, and harvest timber and to monitor soil and water quality in order to maximize sustainable pulpwood yields. In 2003, Appellant made a strategic corporate decision to divest some of its timberland holdings, thereby reducing the percentage of total pulpwood procured from Appellant-owned timberland and increasing the percentage procured from the open market.

Appellant contends that it has been unconstitutionally subjected to duplicative taxation on a portion of its net gain from the sale of timberland because Delaware and Pennsylvania impose taxation on, respectively, 100% and 42% of the net gain. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 46-49. In Appellant’s view, the application of Pennsylvania’s apportionment formula in this instance “unreasonably and arbitrarily [ ] attributes] to the Commonwealth an amount of income which is out of all proportion to the business transacted by [Appellant] in the state.” <em>Id. </em>at 47-49; <em>see also id. </em>at 47 (asserting that, by apportioning 42% of Appellant’s gain from the sale of its Delaware timberland, the Commonwealth “greatly distorts the amount of new income which was earned by [Appellant] in respect of its sales transactions and business activities in the Commonwealth”). Appellant further argues that its sale of Delaware timberland was a discrete business activity unrelated to its pulpwood sales transactions in Pennsylvania, and that Pennsylvania provides no services, such as fire or police protection, highways, sewer, water, recording of deeds, or judicial enforcement, with respect to the Delaware timberland. <em>Id. </em>at 43 n. 25, 46, 48. In addition, Appellant asserts that the Delaware timberland holdings “also serve to some extent as an ‘investment function,’ rather than an operational function,” and thus the gain from their sale should not be apportionable to Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 46.</p>

The timberlands owned by Appellant in Delaware and other states, are the direct sources of some of the pulpwood procured for and sold to Parent in Pennsylvania for use in Parent’s paper mill in Pennsylvania.

The centrality of Pennsylvania to Appellant’s unitary enterprise is illustrated by the location of its headquarters — in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, the same town where Parent operates a paper mill.

Appellant still owned substantial holdings of timberland, including 14,364 remaining acres of timberland in Delaware alone; 25,587 acres in Pennsylvania; and 40,676 acres in Virginia.

Appellant’s stated goal in divesting certain of its timberlands was to "reduc[e] the percentage of pulpwood procured from company-owned timberland from approximately 25 percent to approximately 5 percent.” <em>Id. </em>at ¶ 18.
