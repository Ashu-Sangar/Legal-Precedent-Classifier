During a consensual search of the vehicle, the troopers discovered 35 pounds of marijuana, methamphetamines, drug paraphernalia, a .45 caliber handgun, and a tracfone (a portable cell phone). Michael Amodeo, one of the occupants of the vehicle, told Trooper Richard Houk that he had been using the tracfone to communicate, via text messages, with Appellee Stephen Lanier regarding an exchange of the marijuana for $19,000. Trooper Houk obtained Amodeo’s permission to use the tracfone and, posing as Amodeo, began text-messaging Lanier. Lanier, apparently suspicious, asked several questions to which only Amodeo knew the answers. Trooper Houk consulted with Amodeo and then correctly answered Lanier’s questions. Satisfied that he was communicating with Amodeo, Lanier designated the parking lot of a Holiday Inn as a rendezvous spot to conduct the transaction.</p>

The police confirmed Lanier’s identity, and when he refused to remove his hands from his pockets, police restrained him and recovered $20,000 cash from his coat pocket in a search incident to his arrest.

Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the suppression motions, and the Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), arguing that resolution of the issue on appeal was controlled by the holding in <em>Proetto, <a href="/a2d/771/0823-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="771 A.2d 823" data-case-ids="11102329" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0823-01">supra,</a> </em>and that under <em>Proetto, </em>reversal was required because no “inter<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>ception” had taken place and thus, the Wiretap Act did not apply.

The detective made a log of the chat room conversation, and the defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with criminal solicitation, corruption of minors and related offenses.

In both cases, cited with approval in <em>Proetto, </em>the Superior Court held that the Wiretap Act was not violated because the officers were deemed to be direct parties to the call.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[277,1178,1151,629]]]'>Indeed, the underlying basis of the holding in <em>Proetto </em>was that no interception occurred and no eavesdropping or listening in on a conversation took place because the detective was a direct party to the communication. <em>Id. </em>at 832. That a police officer does not identify him- or herself, or misrepresents his or her identity, does not change the fact that he or she is a direct party to the conversation, and by virtue of being a direct party to the conversation, is deemed the intended recipient of the conversation under whatever identity the officer has set forth. <em>See id. </em>at 831 (“Detective Morris, as ‘Kellyl5F’ was the intended recipient of these communications.”) (emphasis added).</p>

Therefore, Amodeo was the intended recipient of the communications, not Officer Houk.”) (Emphasis added). An officer is deemed the “intended recipient” of a phone communication in which the officer is directly involved, even under circumstances in which the officer shields or misrepresents his or her identity, because the caller elects to talk to the officer who answered the phone. <em>Proetto, supra </em>at 832 <em>(citing Smith, </em>

      <em>supra </em>at 350). The applicability of the Act does not rest on whether the caller’s presumption of the identity of the person answering the call is accurate. It makes no difference instantly that Trooper Houk posed as Amodeo; the fact which takes the case out of the purview of the Act is that Appellee Lanier elected to communicate with the person answering the call and that the communication was direct. Therefore, there was no eavesdropping or listening in, and no interception took place.</p>
