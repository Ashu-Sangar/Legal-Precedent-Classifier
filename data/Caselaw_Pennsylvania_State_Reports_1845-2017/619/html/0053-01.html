      <em>voir dire </em>proceedings conducted by the court, his counsel, and the prosecuting attorney as to substantive issues. We conclude that it does not based upon the principle that a defendant’s right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his or her trial is not absolute, and that under certain circumstances, including where the defendant is physically present in the courtroom and is represented by counsel, the right to be present at every stage of trial is vindicated without the defendant’s being personally able to hear the questioning of each venireperson at sidebar. Because Appellant Christian Hunsberger was physically present in the courtroom during sidebar <em>voir dire </em>proceedings, was represented by counsel, and interacted with counsel during these proceedings, his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him that he had a right to be present at sidebar is without arguable merit. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying relief.</p>

Nothing in the federal or state constitutions, and nothing in Pa.R.Crim.P. 602(a), requires a contrary result. We recognize and reaffirm, as other jurisdictions have done, that trial courts are in the best position to determine how to proceed in each case and how to strike the appropriate balance.

In particular, and for example, I question whether it would be permissible to exclude the defendant from jury selection simply for the jury’s “comfort”, or merely because it might be more efficient to do so. Rather, under the circumstances of this case, it is sufficient in my view to conclude that trial courts, while respecting the defendant’s right to participate in jury selection, have some flexibility to manage the process, but await the appropriate case to test the boundaries of that flexibility.</p>
