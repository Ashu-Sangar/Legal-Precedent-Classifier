Appellant began serving her term in January 2004, and, at the conclusion of her first six-year term, she successfully campaigned for reelection in 2009. Her second term began in January 2010. On November 4, 2010, the Judicial Conduct Board (“Board”) filed a seven-count complaint with the CJD, alleging Appellant violated various Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges (the “MDJ Rules”), including MDJ Rules 2A,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> 3A,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> 4A,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> 4C,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>5A.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The complaint further alleged Appellant violated art.

On February 25, 2011, the Board filed a second complaint containing three new sets of factual allegations relating to violations alleged in the first complaint. The complaints were consolidated, and a three-day trial commenced on May 31, 2011. The CJD classified the extensive evidence presented by the Board into four categories: Work Habits; Truancy Cases; Landlord Tenant Cases; and Demeanor and Abuse of Power.</p>

Specifically, the Board introduced a chart detailing the dates Appellant “called off.” Between September 12, 2007 and December 15, 2009, Appellant called off on <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>116 days, and took 49 days of vacation, thereby failing to report to work at all on 30% of the workdays during that period. In addition, it was established that, on the days Appellant did not call off, she was <em>never </em>on time. Rather, her customary arrival time at court was between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m., despite the fact that hearings were always scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m., and lawyers and litigants therefore were kept waiting. One witness, a police officer, testified that, in light of the number of times he appeared at a scheduled hearing before Appellant, only to learn after he arrived that Appellant had called off, he made it a practice to call Appellant’s courtroom prior to leaving his home. Despite this practice, he recounted at least one occasion when he was told Appellant would be there, but, upon arriving at the courthouse, learned she had called off.</p>
    <p id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[276,1153,1153,688]]]'>The Board also presented testimony regarding the detrimental impact of Appellant’s conduct on her staff, who often spent most of the morning making telephone calls to attorneys, litigants, and witnesses to advise them that their hearings were continued; preparing and mailing notices of new hearing dates; and attempting to placate angry litigants and witnesses. These activities interfered with the staffs ability to handle the regular, day-to-day business of the court. Deborah Stringer, Appellant’s former office manager, testified that Appellant’s excessive absenteeism caused a backlog of paperwork in the office, such that often cases were not closed in a timely manner; and criminal defendants were not promptly given credit for time served.

William Allen High School, which is part of the Allentown School District, is located in Appellant’s jurisdiction. The high school had a serious truancy problem, and, as a result, Suzette Arcelay, the home school visitor for the district, was required to appear before Appellant two days a week for truancy <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>hearings,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> where she would present documentation of illegal absences. Arcelay testified that she customarily arrived at court between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. for hearings scheduled for 9:30 a.m., but that Appellant typically did not arrive until between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m. N.T., 6/1/11, at 367. Arcelay further testified that Appellant sometimes would call off on the day of the truancy hearings, calling in as late as 10:30 or 11:00 a.m., and the hearings would need to be continued, after the families were already present. <em>Id. </em>at 369.' In fact, the school district received numerous complaints from parents who missed work in order to attend a child’s truancy hearing, which ultimately was continued because Appellant failed to appear. As a result of receiving so many complaints regarding Appellant’s absences and tardiness, Patricia Welle-Feldman, the student services coordinator for' the Allentown School District, ultimately spoke with her supervisor, and they contacted the Lehigh County Court Administration Office, requesting reassignment of truancy cases to a different judge. <em>Id. </em>at 441.</p>
    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[152,1361,1155,624]]]'>The Board also introduced evidence of Appellant’s procedure for handling truancy cases when she was in court. Prior to 2009, when a truant student and his or her parents did not appear for a scheduled hearing, Appellant would meet with Arcelay after the completion of the hearings, identify the “no-shows,” and either continue the hearing or impose a fine <em>in absentia. </em>Beginning in 2009, Appellant changed her procedure, and no longer disposed of the “no-shows” at the end of the day. Rather, Appellant would tell Arcelay that she was tired, and that she would give Arcelay the information “the next day or whenever she got a chance to do them.” <em>Id. </em>at 392.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 394-95. Welle-Feldman explained that these delays caused serious problems for the school district because the students who were involved already had truancy problems, but suffered no immediate consequences when they chose not to report for their hearing, and the student would continue to be truant until sentence was imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 446-48. (“When a case is continued, that student now has an opportunity for another four to six weeks of school absence. By the time anyone actually addresses something, that student could be out of school for 40-60 or more days.”). Thus, a student’s record of truancy often was extended due to Appellant’s failure to adjudicate the matters in a timely fashion. Moreover, unsurprisingly, Welle-Feldman testified that it set a poor example for students charged -with truancy or tardiness to be summoned to court where the judge herself failed to appear, or appeared late, for the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 440.</p>

The Board presented evidence that, notwithstanding Rule 512, Appellant gave her staff standing instructions on how they were to handle landlord/tenant cases when she was absent from court. First, in cases where the landlord was present and the tenant was not, or in cases where both the landlord and tenant were present and they agreed on the relief plaintiff was seeking, Appellant’s staff was instructed to enter judgment on a Notice of Judgment form and mail it to the parties immediately, or by the next day.

For example, in <em>Berkhimer, supra, </em>a magisterial district judge who subjected his female employees to expletive-filled language, and offensive, embarrassing and inappropriate comments, both in public and in private, on a daily basis, was found to have brought his judicial office into disrepute in violation of Section 18(d)(1). In <em>In re Zoller, </em>a magisterial district judge who used profanity, threw his pen down on the bench, and behaved in an angry, agitated, loud, and confrontational manner during a single arraignment was found to have brought his judicial office into disrepute in violation of Section 18(d)(1). <a href="/a2d/792/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="792 A.2d 34" data-case-ids="9509364" data-case-paths="/a2d/792/0034-01">792 A.2d 34</a>, 38-39 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2001) (“We believe that it is beyond dispute or debate that the expectations of the public include the expectation that the business of its government’s judicial system will be conducted in a place where dignity and grace are not strangers and where ordinary good manners are not excluded.”). Thus, the fact that Appellant’s conduct was not criminal in nature does not preclude a determination that her conduct brought her office into disrepute. A finding that a judge has engaged in offensive, confrontational, or discourteous conduct on the bench may also support a violation of Section 18(d)(1).</p>

It is beyond hypocritical for a judge who repeatedly fails to appear, or consistently appears late, for scheduled court proceedings to lecture and impose sanctions upon a juvenile who is appearing before the judge due to truancy issues.
