We hold that Rule 600 requires a defendant to file a written motion to dismiss, and that, by failing to appear in court on the day his or her case is listed for trial, a defendant waives his or her Rule 600 claim. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b340-9" data-blocks='[["BL_340.9",340,[274,1281,1151,579]]]'>On June 3, 2003, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint against Brock, charging him with burglary, attempted murder, aggravated assault, criminal trespass, and firearms violations. Brock was arrested on June 16, 2003. The case was first listed for trial on December 15, 2003, but was continued numerous times until March 8, 2005. On that date, Brock, who was on house arrest pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600(E),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> failed to appear for court. A bench warrant for his arrest was issued on March 18, 2005; however, when police went to his residence on that date, he was not there. Thereafter, the Commonwealth made no further efforts to locate him.</p>
    <p id="b340-10" data-blocks='[["BL_340.10",340,[274,1889,1151,311]],["BL_341.1",341,[156,310,1148,206]]]'>On January 25, 2006, Brock was arrested in Williamsport, Pennsylvania on unrelated charges. On that same day, a Williamsport police officer notified authorities in Philadelphia that Brock was in custody, but no attempt was made to secure his return to Philadelphia for trial. On September 27, 2006, authorities from the State Correctional Institute at Camp Hill <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>(“SCI-Camp Hill”) notified Philadelphia police that Brock was in custody on an unrelated matter. At this point, the Commonwealth arranged for Brock’s return to Philadelphia to stand trial on the June 3, 2003 charges.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[156,558,1154,698]]]'>On May 24, 2007, Brock’s attorney orally argued that he was entitled to the dismissal of all charges, with prejudice, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> because more than 365 days of non-excludable time had elapsed from the date of the filing of the original criminal complaint. That same day, the trial court held a hearing on Brock’s oral motion. Eight months later, the trial court held a second hearing on January 18, 2008, at which the Commonwealth argued that Brock waived his Rule 600 claim by failing to file a written motion. Additionally, the Commonwealth asserted that Brock waived his Rule 600 claim by failing to appear for the trial listing on March 8, 2005. On January 18, 2008, the trial court granted Brock’s motion and dismissed the charges against him.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[162,1298,1152,908]]]'>In granting Brock’s motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>the Commonwealth failed to exercise due diligence between January 25, 2006 (the day it was notified that Williamsport police had Brock in custody) and September 27, 2006 (the day it was notified that Brock was in custody at SCI-Camp Hill) because it made no attempt to have Brock returned to Philadelphia for trial. Thus, the trial court found this 244-day period chargeable to the Commonwealth, and held that, at the time Brock moved for discharge, there already had been 504 days of non-excludable time and the run date for Rule 600 had expired. The trial court further rejected the Commonwealth’s contention that Brock waived his Rule 600 claim by failing to file a written motion. Citing <em>Commonwealth v. Bowes, </em><a href="/a2d/839/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="839 A.2d 422" data-case-ids="9057548" data-case-paths="/a2d/839/0422-01">839 A.2d 422</a> (Pa.Super.2003), the trial court stated “Rule 600 contains no requirement that a motion to dismiss be written.” Trial Court Opinion, 3/19/08, at 5.

      <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>On June 8, 2010, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s decision in an unpublished memorandum opinion. The Superior Court first rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that Brock waived his Rule 600 claim by failing to file a written motion. Like the trial court, the Superior Court relied on its decision in <em>Bowes </em>for the proposition that an oral motion is sufficient to preserve a Rule 600 claim. The court further rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that Brock waived his Rule 600 claim by failing to appear in court on March 8, 2005, the date his case was listed for trial. The court reasoned that a trial commences under Rule 600 when the first substantial step toward the guilt-determining process occurs, and, because there was no evidence that such first step occurred on March 8, 2005, trial had not commenced, and thus Brock had not waived his Rule 600 claim. <em>Commonwealth v.

The jury venire was empanelled and jury selection was scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. that same day, but when the defendant failed to appear at that time, the trial judge ordered a recess until the next morning. The defendant again failed to appear, and was apprehended eleven days later. Trial was rescheduled for a date outside the Rule 1100 date, and, on that day, the defendant filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 1100. The trial court granted the motion, and the Superior Court affirmed. Upon appeal by the Commonwealth, this Court reversed, stating:</p>
