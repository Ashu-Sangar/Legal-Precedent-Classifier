Dr. Wright’s sole reason for disregarding appellee’s childhood IQ scores was that the Stanford-Binet test was outside cultural norms, making it unreliable for African-Americans. Appellee points out the treatise that Dr. Wright relied upon for his assertion removed the criticism from its most recent edition. Additionally, appellee asserts Dr. Wright admitted he incorrectly discounted the existence of any adaptive deficits because appellee tried to care for the household, hold a job, and cook for his family, as it was contrary to a treatise entitled <em>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry.</em>

    <p id="b299-6" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[159,1555,1153,803]]]'>Appellee asserts our question for review was to specifically address whether his intellectual functioning meets the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation, not whether his IQ scores were within the range of mental retardation. Additionally, appellee contends the Commonwealth’s allegation the PCRA court failed to consider the record as a whole is simply erroneous because the court, which presided over appellee’s trial, sentencing, and PCRA evidentiary hearing, heard testimony from all expert and lay witnesses, and properly determined by a preponderance of the evidence appellee is mentally retarded. Accordingly, as this Court is bound by the PCRA court’s factual findings and must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, appellee contends the Commonwealth has provided no valid reason to overturn its ruling.</p>

      <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>We must determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the PCRA court’s finding appellee established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is mentally retarded according to the AAMR and DSM-IV definitions adopted in <em>Miller. </em>With regard to limited intellectual functioning, appellee was administered IQ tests throughout his life. At age eight, he scored 68 on the Stanford-Binet test, 64 on the same test at age 12, and 59 on the same test at age 15. As an adult, appellee scored 81 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence in February, 2000, as stipulated by Drs. Wright, Marston, and Martell; however, the test cannot be used diagnostically because it is solely a screening tool. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/12/10, at 35, 138; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/14/10, at 531; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/15/10, at 662. Appellee also scored 76 on the WAIS in September, 2000; however, the expert who administered the exam rendered the score unreliable because of the significant scatter in subscores. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/12/10, at 25, 136. In his most recent IQ test, appellee scored 72 on the WAIS-IV. Averaging all of appellee’s IQ tests, Dr. Martell found his IQ score was 71.6, considering group and non-reliable testing methods, and 67.8 over his entire life. Dr. Musser found appellee’s IQ was between 70 and 75. Drs. Crown, Kessel, and Marston found appellee’s overall IQ was 72. Foregoing a definitive IQ score, Dr. Wright believed appellee has low to borderline mental retardation. After hearing this testimony and reviewing appellee’s records, the PCRA court held appellee’s IQ was between 70 and 75, placing him in the mild mental retardation range, which was sufficient to find appellee satisfied the first prong of the <em>Miller </em>test.</p>

Dr. Martell found appellee was deficient in seven of the 11 skill areas of the DSM-IV and deficient in all three areas under the AAMR standard. Dr. Crown found appellee had significant subaverage intellectual functioning under both classifications. Drs. Toomer and Musser found appellee was deficient in eight areas under the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>DSM-IV and in all three areas under the AAMR. In contrast, Dr. Marston testified although appellee showed some impairment in the AAMR’s areas, none of the impairments were significant, and his impairment in only one area of the DSM-IV’s definition was sufficiently low enough to be significant. Dr. Wright found appellee had sufficient adaptive functioning skills. Lay witnesses also testified regarding appellee’s life experiences, including his inability to read, perform basic job-related tasks, handle finances, assist his son with homework, and take care of his diabetes. The PCRA court was free to find appellee’s experts credible, as there was sufficient evidence to find appellee has significant limitations in adaptive functioning, and the fact the court chose to give greater weight to these witnesses’ testimony is not a reason to reverse its ruling. <em>See Commonwealth v. White, </em><a href="/pa/557/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="557 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="56843" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0408-01">557 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/a2d/734/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="734 A.2d 374" data-case-ids="11543362,56843" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0374-01,/pa/557/0408-01">734 A.2d 374</a>, 381 (1999) (where record supports PCRA court’s credibility determinations, they are binding on reviewing court) (citations omitted).</p>

As expressed by several of appellee’s experts, the focus should be on an individual’s weaknesses — not his or her strengths — as mentally retarded people can function in society and are able to obtain and hold low-skilled jobs, as well as have a family. This is represented in the DSM-IV and AAMR’s definitions by an individual’s classification as mentally retarded even though he may have relatively strong skills in distinct categories. Thus, the Commonwealth’s assertion the PCRA court erred in finding appellee has significant adaptive deficiencies because he provides for his family and is capable of working is erroneous. Furthermore, the PCRA court’s determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed, as its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence; thus, the Commonwealth’s assertion the PCRA court erroneously credited appellee’s experts over its own ignores our standard of review. We conclude the evidence supports the PCRA court’s finding that appellee met his burden of establishing <em>Miller’s </em>second prong by a preponderance of the evidence. Turning to <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>the third prong of the <em>Miller </em>test, all of appellee’s witnesses expressly stated his mental retardation was present well before he reached the age of 18. The Commonwealth’s witnesses denied appellee was mentally retarded in general and questioned the Stanford-Binet test’s reliability. As a child, appellee was placed in special education, was unable to form social relationships, was continuously bullied, and had issues with his health and safety. Relying heavily on the StanfordBinet test and considering appellee’s various childhood problems, the PCRA court found his childhood IQ scores were reliable, and determined appellee’s mental retardation was present prior to age 18.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[265,962,1153,664]]]'>The Commonwealth’s contention the PCRA court erroneously relied on the Stanford-Binet test is meritless. The treatise the Commonwealth’s expert relied on in asserting the test was unreliable subsequently eliminated such concerns in its latest version. Further, the test’s results are currently accepted and clinically relied upon in the scientific community. Thus, because the test is the best available evidence to review appellee’s intellect as a child, and is relied upon in the scientific community, it was properly considered by the PCRA court in determining whether appellee satisfied the third prong of the <em>Miller </em>test. We conclude the evidence supports the PCRA court’s finding this prong was met by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
