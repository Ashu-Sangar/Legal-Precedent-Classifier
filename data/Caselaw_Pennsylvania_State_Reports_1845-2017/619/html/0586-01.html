The Senate supplied documents relating to five clients, totaling nearly one hundred pages, many of which were invoices from various law firms reflecting the attorney or paralegal’s initials, dates and hours worked, and fees charged. However, large blocks of the documents were redacted, presumably involving itemized descriptions of the work and the clients’ names.</p>

Levy asserted that the “redactions seem to apply to [the] identity of the client and, possibly, the reason for which the attorney is being hired. That information is not considered under the umbrella of a ‘work product’ or a ‘privilege.’” Appeal Letter of Marc Levy, Aug. 11, 2010 (“Appeal Letter”).

While the previous filings in the case were brief letters, on August 19, 2010, the Senate filed a lengthy “Senate Response to the RTK Appeal.” In this filing, the Senate observed that the RTKL provides for redaction of documents under Section 706, 65 P.S. § 67.706 (“the agency shall redact from the record the information which is not subject to access”). "While the Senate <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>reasserted its claim that the redactions were necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege, it also asserted, for the first time, that some of the redacted portions were protected from disclosure due to the work product privilege, grand jury secrecy, and the criminal investigation exception of Section 708(b)(16) of the RTKL, 65P.S. § 67.708(b)(16).</p>

Levy emphasized that the RTKL places the burden on the Senate to prove the application of any exception. Moreover, he observed that there is a presumption of disclosure for public records, including financial documents, in the RTKL. In response to the Senate’s attorney-client privilege argument, Levy contended that the rule in Pennsylvania and elsewhere provides that a client’s identity and billing records are not protected unless disclosure would reveal confidential communications between the client and attorney. Levy further addressed and rejected the merits of the Senate’s claims that the documents were not subject to disclosure due to the work product privilege, grand jury secrecy, and the criminal investigation exception, the merits of which are not relevant to this appeal.</p>

The Officer observed that under Pennsylvania law, the party asserting the attorney-client privilege has the burden to prove that the privilege has been properly invoked. In accord with that prerequisite, the Officer concluded that the Senate had demonstrated that each of the asserted holders of the privilege sought to become a client of an attorney, communicated that to an attorney, and that all of the clients were asserting rather than waiving the privilege. The Officer, however, could not determine whether the Senate had demonstrated the other necessary criteria for attorney-client privilege: whether the communication of the client seeking the attorney’s representation was made “without the presence of strangers” and “not for the purpose of committing a crime or tort.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Final Determination of Sept. 16, 2010, at 8. <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>As a result, the Senate Appeals Officer provided the Senate with the opportunity to provide sworn affidavits or other probative evidence to address those issues but did not set a date by which the Senate had to file the ordered documents. The Officer also noted that the Senate raised additional reasons for the redactions based on the work product privilege, grand jury secrecy, and criminal investigation exceptions. He concluded, however, that the Senate failed to demonstrate the necessary factual predicate for assertion of those exceptions.</p>

[t]he specific reasons for the denial” to have no meaning. Levy contends that the <em>Signature Information </em>Rule is consistent with Section 1101(a)(1) which provides that the requester “shall address any grounds stated by the agency for delaying or denying” the request. Levy maintains that this section would be rendered meaningless if the agency can assert new reasons for denying the records after the requester has filed its appeal. Additionally, Levy looks to the next section, Section 1102(a), providing that an appeals officer shall set a schedule for the parties “to submit documents in support of their positions.” Levy argues that this language clearly refers to their established positions and not to new arguments raised before the appeals officer.</p>

Levy first attempts to undermine the Senate’s argument that the <em>Signature Information </em>Rule improperly creates a two-track system of appeals of written versus deemed denials. Levy contends that this conundrum does not actually exist because the Commonwealth Court has not addressed the question of waiver of reasons for denial in a standard deemed denial case, even if the OOR is permitting supplementation in such cases. Moreover, Levy contends that there is no threat that agencies would methodically utilize the deemed denial option because of the potential for sanctions to agencies acting in bad faith, 65 P.S. § 67.1305(a).</p>

Instead, Levy observes that this stage is not ministerial but a critical function of the RTKL, involving twelve statutory sections. Additionally, he argues that the initial denial period is not so brief as to forbid the imposition of a waiver rule, noting that agencies have up to thirty-five days to determine if reasons for denial exist, whereas civil defendants are subject to waiver of any defenses not raised within twenty days of the filing of a complaint.</p>

Section 903 provides in relevant part, “If an agency’s response is a denial of a written request for access, whether in whole or in part, the denial shall be issued in writing and shall include ... (2) The specific reasons for the denial, including a citation of supporting legal authority.” 65 P.S. § 67.903.

Section 903’s language requires agencies to include “[t]he specific reasons for the denial.” As noted by the Senate and its <em>amici, </em>the section does not specify that the agency must include “all” the specific reasons in its initial written denial nor does it indicate that any reasons not listed are waived. Conversely, the statute has no language to suggest that the agency may <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>provide only some or initial reasons for denial, nor does the RTKL provide any particular opportunity to raise additional reasons for denial. A similar analysis can be applied to Section 1101’s requirement that the requester address “any grounds stated by the agency” and Section 1102’s provision for the submission of documents “in support of their positions.” Accordingly, we fail to ascertain from the plain language whether waiver applies to all reasons for nondisclosure not included in an agency’s Section 903 written denial and instead determine that the language is ambiguous. Therefore, we must consider other indicators of legislative intent including “[t]he occasion and necessity for the statute,” “[t]he mischief to be remedied,” “[t]he object to be attained,” and “[t]he consequences of a particular interpretation.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>

Indeed, Section 708 places the burden of proving an exception squarely on the agency by a preponderance of the evidence. 65 P.S. § 67.708.

In these provisions, we recognize a legislative intent to shield numerous categories and subcategories of documents from disclosure in order to protect, <em>inter alia, </em>the Commonwealth’s security interests and individuals’ privacy rights. As noted by the Senate and its <em>amici, </em>adoption of the <em>Signature Information </em>Rule undermines the specific legislative intent to shield these documents from disclosure, merely as a consequence of an open records officer’s failure to list a legitimate reason for nondisclosure on the agency’s initial written denial. Indeed, the officer may have asserted what he or she thought were the most obvious reasons for denial, and failed to consider the other eight pages of potential exceptions. Additionally, given the specified statutory time frame for each stage of the RTKL process, there is little concern that the addition of new reasons for non-disclosure at the appeals officer stage will effect the speed of any ultimate decision as the appeals officer’s decision must be issued -within thirty days regardless of the number of asserted reasons for denial.</p>

The Pennsylvania School Boards Association and the Governor's Office of General Counsel file separate <em>amicus curiae </em>briefs, each voicing a concern, inter alia, that the <em>Signature Information </em>Rule could allow the disclosure of individuals’ personal information, arguably violating constitutional rights, due to a ministerial mistake of an agency's open records officer failing to raise the appropriate exception.

    <p id="b682-9" data-blocks='[["BL_682.9",682,[265,1320,1153,633]]]'>I agree with the majority’s disposition of this case. Respectfully, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the statute is ambiguous. That the statute does not address the specific question before us does not mean it is ambiguous — it means it is silent. While it may seem a quibbling distinction, statutory silence on a question of procedural waiver does not in my judgment comprise ambiguity, a notion involving language from which multiple meanings can be taken. Here, the issue is a waiver rule, a subject not addressed by the statute— there being no statutory language about waiver, there is nothing that is subject to multiple meanings, and hence no ambiguity.</p>

An agency’s failure to respond to requests within a specified time-frame means the request will be “deemed denied.” 65 P.S. §§ 67.901, 67.902(b)(2)-(3); see <em>also </em>Majority Op., at 608-10, 65 A.3d at 375-76. The statute provides for a general denial with no indication at all of “specific reasons for the denial [or] ... citation of supporting legal authority.” 65 P.S. § 67.903(2). As the statute provides that listing no reason at all waives nothing, the <em>Signature Information </em>waiver rule (reasons not listed are waived) is contrary to the plain language of the statute.</p>
