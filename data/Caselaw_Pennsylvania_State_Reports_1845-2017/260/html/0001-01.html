    <p class="syllabus" id="b33-9" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[197,1335,1148,918]]]'>2. In an action on a building contract and for extras furnished in connection therewith, the defense was that plaintiff had been paid in full by direct payments to him and through the payment of bills of third parties for liabilities incurred by him. At the trial there was a conflict in the evidence concerning the alleged payments to persons other than plaintiff, on the latter’s account, and defendant largely relied upon a receipt or voucher, endorsed by plaintiff, reading, “The treasurer of [defendant] will please pay [plaintiff], or order......on account of contract in full.” The trial judge ruled that in view of the circumstances and considering the lapse of time (over five years) since the building was completed and the voucher endorsed, such receipt was conclusive evidence of a complete settlement. The action was brought within the statutory period. <em>Held, </em>(1) there was not sufficient evidence to show a dispute between the parties at the time the voucher was signed, (2) there was not sufficient evidence that the sum .represented by the voucher was expressly tendered or accepted on the basis of a settlement in full, (3) the phraseology of the voucher was too vague to be considered, as a matter of law, as a complete acquittance, and (4) the lower court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b34-12" data-blocks='[["BL_34.26",34,[257,2215,1141,156]],["BL_35.1",35,[174,325,1149,377]]]'>The defendant admitted the stipulated price of $26,-000, $1,501 of extras, the completion of the building in accordance with the contract, and its acceptance; but <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>contended that plaintiff had been paid in full, (1) by direct payments to him, (2) through the payment of bills of third parties for liabilities incurred by him, and (3) by a final payment to plaintiff, “on August 2,1906,...... of $57.27......, in full of all demands due him for all work and material done and furnished by him to or on account of the building mentioned in said contract.”</p>
    <p id="b35-6" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[173,713,1150,800]]]'>At trial, there was a conflict in the evidence concerning the alleged payments to persons other than plaintiff, on the latter’s account, but to show payment in full defendant produced, and largely relied upon, a receipt or voucher, endorsed by plaintiff, dated August 2, 1906, reading, “The treasurer of Hill Top Section, J. P. Augustine, will please pay Wm. Thomas, Cont., or order, fifty-seven 27/100 dollars on account of contract in full,” and signed by the president and secretary of the defendant corporation. The trial judge ruled that, in view of all the circumstances, and considering the lapse of time since the building was completed and this voucher endorsed, that document must be accepted as conclusive evidence of a complete settlement, which barred the claim in suit.</p>
    <p id="b35-7" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[171,1533,1151,806]]]'>We cannot agree with the conclusion reached by the learned court below. The action was. brought within the statutory period, and there was not sufficient evidence to show a dispute between the parties, at the time the voucher was signed, as to the amount of plaintiff’s claim, which would take the case at bar out of the established general rule that the acceptance of a smaller sum in payment of a larger amount presently due is no bar to an action for the balance; nor was the undisputed evidence sufficient to prove a settlement in full, or that the sum represented by the voucher was expressly tendered or accepted on that basis; finally, the phraseology of the document in question — “on account of contract in full” —is too vague to be construed, in law, as a complete acquittance.</p>
