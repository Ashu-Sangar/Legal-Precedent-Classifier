Girard avenue at this point is 120 feet wide from house to house and 88 feet between curbs, and the center is occupied by a double-track car line on each side of which is a driveway about thirty-five feet wide, the northern one being for westbound and the southern for eastbound traffic. There were no vehicles of any sort, other than defendant’s machine, moving upon the street at or about the time of the accident. When plaintiff reached the center of the avenue, he looked to the west and saw defendant’s automobile some 120 yards away; He continued toward the south curb, keeping in view the advancing machine; but the latter approached at such speed that it came almost upon him before he could reach the curb. In an attempt to avoid being struck, plaintiff stepped backward, toward the center of the street, but the automobile swerved in the same direction. Plaintiff then went quickly forward, but the automobile again pursued him; and, when within six to ten feet of the curb, he was struck, knocked down and badly injured, the machine running up on the pavement before it came to a stop.</p>
    <p id="b315-3" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[181,1646,1148,308]]]'>The chauffeur admitted that he saw plaintiff crossing Girard avenue when the automobile was at least 269 feet distant from the point of the accident, and that he could have stopped at any time within ten or twelve feet; but apparently he made no serious attempt to do so before the collision occurred.</p>
