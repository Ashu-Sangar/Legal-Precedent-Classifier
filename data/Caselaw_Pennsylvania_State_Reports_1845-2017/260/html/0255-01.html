Defendant offered to prove that it was an accommodation maker, that its act in making and endorsing the note was ultra vires and contended that the note was not negotiable. There was no allegation of any fraud in connection with the execution of the note or use of it afterward. The trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff upon which judgment was entered. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

I understand from the argument of counsel that he would concede the negotiability of the note if the right to' call for additional security were given .on condition that'the market value of the security given as col<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>lateral had decreased. I see no distinction between a note giving to the holder the right to demand additional security in case the market value of the security pledged decreases and a note of the character of the one at bar. In the former case the holder of the note must be the judge as to whether the market value of the security has decreased or not, and therefore the right to demand additional security in that case, as well as in this one, depends entirely upon the judgment of the holder of the note.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[284,895,1152,587]]]'>But it will be observed that it is not simply the will of the holder of the note that makes this note payable; it is the failure of the maker to respond with additional security on demand, and such a failure on the part of the maker of the note to perform an obligation on his part has always been held to be the happening of such an event as will make the time certain at which the note is to mature. There is in this note a fixed time at which it matures if it does mature earlier, and in my opinion the clause in question does not. render the time of maturity so uncertain as to render the note nonnegotiable.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[287,1495,1146,308]]]'>Another objection is made to the note in regard to the fixing of the time at which the collateral may be sold, and emphasis is placed upon the alleged fact that the note gives to the holder the right to sell the collateral “at any time or times hereafter.” The provision is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[285,1823,1147,481]]]'>“With full power and authority to the holder hereof to sell and assign and deliver the whole of the above-mentioned security, or any part thereof, or any substitute thereof, or any addition thereto, or any other property at anytime given unto or left in possession of the holder hereof, at any brokers’ board, or at public or private sale, at the option of the holder hereof on the nonperformance of this promise, or the nonpayment of any of the liabilities above mentioned, at any time or times hereafter.”</p>

Now, it has been held by the courts of this State that a contract making the collateral subject to the payment of other indebtedness besides the one for which the collateral was particularly pledged, is a valid agreement, and therefore it must follow that the right to sell the collateral for the nonpayment of the other indebtedness is equally as valid and does not destroy the negotiability of the note. Notes with collateral contracts identical with this have been sustained so often by the courts of this State that I take it it is too late now to urge that such contracts destroy the negotiability of the note.</p>

The letter was written on July 6th, and in the ordinary course would have been received by the defendant on July 7th. In that the defendant was notified that the collateral would be sold unless the amount of the note was made promptly, and a request that that promptness be by return mail. Certainly, if there was no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to give any notice, the fact that they gave notice, which in the ordinary operation of the mails would have been sufficient time for the defendant to have paid the note and stopped the sale, the plaintiff did all that could be required of them. It is urged that the defendant not having an office at the Keystone Building in Pittsburgh did not receive the letter until July 8th, when it was forwarded to its office in Butler, Pa. But, as I stated be<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>fore, tlie plaintiff had communicated prior to this with the defendant, directing its letters to the Keystone Building in Pittsburgh, and no complaint had been made by the defendant and no directions to send future letters to Butler, Pa.</p>
