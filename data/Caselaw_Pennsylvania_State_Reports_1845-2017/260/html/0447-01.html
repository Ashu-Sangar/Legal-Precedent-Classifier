    <p class="summary" id="b480-7" data-blocks='[["BL_480.14",480,[280,1249,1151,643]]]'>This is an action against the City of Philadelphia to recover the sum of $10,000, the amount appropriated to the plaintiff by an ordinance of councils of Philadelphia, and for which a warrant was duly issued and signed by the proper officers, but not countersigned by the controller. The warrant was afterwards cancelled and destroyed and the amount appropriated transferred to one of the other departments of the city. There was no issue of fact in the case and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff. A motion for judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto has been taken on the ground that the appropriation was invalid.</p>

City of Philadelphia, 20 Pa. Dist. Reports 531. In the case at bar a meeting of citizens was held in the office of the mayor, at which it was decided to give a series of historical pageants. As a matter of convenience a corporation was formed, The Historical Pageant Association, which is the plaintiff in this proceeding. This corporation conducted a series of brilliant <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>pageants in Fairmount Park in the year. 1912. Its object was the education of the citizens in the history of the City of Philadelphia and the encouragement of civic pride and patriotism. Stands were erected containing reserved seats, which were sold, and contributions were made by private citizens. The public was admitted free to a portion of the audience space. There was no element of gain in the enterprise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-3" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[165,739,1149,428]]]'>The entertainment was a very expensive one. The amounts received from the sale of seats, from contributions and from other sources were over $105,000, but at the conclusion of the entertainment there was a deficit of approximately $15,000. When the deficit was discovered an ordinance was introduced into the councils which was passed by the requisite two-thirds vote and duly approved by the mayor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[164,1177,1151,592]]]'>In our opinion the appropriation was invalid. The efforts of the incorporators were praiseworthy and generous and an instructive entertainment was provided for those citizens who had opportunity to attend the pageant. Notwithstanding these facts, we think it was not a municipal enterprise. The City of Philadelphia as a municipality received no benefit. In the nature of things it was possible for only a limited number of citizens to witness the entertainment. Many of these paid tor the privilege and others obtained the privilege without cost. The vast body of the citizens received no benefit whatever.</p>

Had the receipts from the sale of seats and from other contributions been sufficient to discharge their obligations the affair would not have been a municipal affair in any sense, Unfortunately <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>there was a deficit. The appropriation, under these circumstances cannot be sustained upon the ground of moral obligation. Judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto must therefore be entered.</p>
