Testatrix by will provided, “It is my will that all my property ......of which I shall die possessed......may remain intact and the income therefrom be used for the benefit of my children,” and then appointed her husband trustee of the estate and guardian of the children. The will further provided, “When all the children are deceased, the estate is to be divided equally among their heirs. Should any child die without issue, the portion of such child shall be divided equally between the direct heirs of the other children.” In case of the death of all the children without issue the will provided for a gift over. Testatrix’s husband and seven children, all minors, survived her and five thereafter reached their majority. Thereafter the husband died, but prior to his death he declined to act as trustee and assigned his interest in the estate to his children. A trust company was appointed trustee. <em>Held, </em>(1) the trust estate created by the testatrix for her children was active and they had equitable life estates, and (2) the estates of the contingent remaindermen were legal and the rule in Shelley’s Case did not apply.</p>

L. 368, became a fee. But their estates for life are only equitable, the legal title being in the trustee, whilst the estates in remainder are contingent legal estates, and it is well settled that the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply, unless the estates for <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>life and in remainder are of the same nature: Eife v.

But as the credit has by the confirmation of the former account been allowed by the court, the question is res judicata as to all of the ex-ceptants who were then sui juris. But it is alleged that some were not, and that the trustee was also their guardian, and under these facts, as to the minor children, the decree would not be res judicata. All the other parties in interest had agreed to pay two per cent, commissions to the agent negotiating the sale, and although there does not appear to have been any express agreement by the trustee to pay commissions, it considered itself bound by the agreement. The estate was greatly benefited by the sale and services rendered by the agent. Equitably it should contribute to the necessary expenses, and as the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>amount paid was reasonable, the payment is approved by the court, and this exception is dismissed.</p>

It appears from the evidence that the trustee could not have invested in rentable real estate yielding six per cent., and it is clear that the exceptants have not suffered any loss by the investments made, as the income from the estate since the real estate was sold has been increased from one thousand dollars to three thousand dollars per annum.
