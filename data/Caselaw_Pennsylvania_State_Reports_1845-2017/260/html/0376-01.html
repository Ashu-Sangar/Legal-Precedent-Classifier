Strong for life and upon her death to pay the-same to her daughter, Annie, and gave an additional sum of $8,000 in trust to pay the income therefrom to the said Annie during life or until her marriage and thereafter to pay the said net income to said Annie for her sole and separate use and in case of the death of Annie leaving issue a child or children for their lives, “but in case the said Annie E. Strong should die without issue then my will is that the said sum of $8,000 as well as the said sum of $8,000 first above mentioned after the death of said Susanna E. Strong shall go to my next legal heir or heirs. My will being that the income of said sum of $8,000 shall after the death of the said Susanna E. Strong be added to and form a part of the income of the said' Annie E. Strong and her children and only to revert to my <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>next legal heir or heirs in case of the death of the said Annie E. Strong without issue as hereinbefore mentioned.” Testator bequeathed the residue of his estate to his heirs. Susanna and Annie survived testator; thereafter Susanna died and afterwards Annie, leaving two children and no issue of deceased children. Said children contended that the trust should be terminated, that the estate vested in them absolutely on the ground that the will created a perpetuity and on the ground that the word “issue” indicated an indefinite failure of issue. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the estate given to the children of Annie vested within the period required by the rule against perpetuities; (2) that a definite failure of issue was intended, but that even if this wer'e not the case the remainders over to the heirs would not coalesce with the life estates, as the life estates were equitable and the estate in remainder legal, and that (3) the trust could not be terminated during the lives of the children of Annie.</p>

Strong, secondly to her daughter, Annie E. Strong, who were both in existence during the lifetime of the testator, and thirdly to the children of Annie E. Strong who necessarily were in existence at the time of the latter’s death. The equitable estate of the children of Annie E. Strong <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>thus vested within the period prescribed by the rule against perpetuities, namely a life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter: Lawrence’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="136 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="819995" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0354-01">136 Pa. 354</a>. And even if the remainder should offend the rule against perpetuities, that will not destroy the preceding life estates: Whitman’s Est., <a href="/pa/248/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="248 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1011486" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0285-01">248 Pa. 285</a>. Nor can the gift over coalesce with the life estates in this case, as the life estate is equitable and the estate in remainder necessarily legal. That the life estate is equitable is shown by the terms of the will. The duties of the trustee are active, and the gifts to the various beneficiaries are not of principal but of the income derived from the active trust: Hemphill’s Est., <a href="/pa/180/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="180 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="888348" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0095-01">180 Pa. 95</a>; Shower’s Est., <a href="/pa/211/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="211 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="940052" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0297-01">211 Pa. 297</a>; nor is the auditing judge convinced that even were the particular estates legal the result would be a coalescing of the life estates in the children of Annie E. Strong with the remainder in Annie E. Strong and her children. It is clear from the language of the gift that the word “issue” is used interchangeably with and in substitution for the word “children.” Moreover, the words “die without issue,” must, under the Act of July 9,1897, P. L. 213, be construed to mean not an indefinite failure of issue but a want of issue at the death of Annie E. Strong, in the absence of a contrary intention disclosed by the will.</p>
