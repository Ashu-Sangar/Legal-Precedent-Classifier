D. 1916, by a vote of 10,209, and having a majority of 456, being more than one-half of the total vote cast in said county for the said office and that he was duly inducted into said office, and is now sitting as a member of the said senate, representing said county, and that, as appears by the declarations filed in the case, the plaintiff was a candidate for election for the office of member of the senate of Pennsylvania at the election held in November 7, 1916, and that the alleged slanderous words were uttered of and concerning him with regard to his fitness to be chosen by the voters at the said election for the said office, and that, by reason of the large number of inhabitants, casting their ballots at said election for the said plaintiff, a local prejudice exists to such an extent that the defendant cannot have a fair and impartial trial in said county; (c) because the plaintiff has an undue influence over the minds of the inhabitants of the said County of Chester, so that a fair and impartial trial cannot b.e had, in that he was, on the day above mentioned, elected as senator on the Republican party ticket, and he is now, and has been for many years past, the recognized leader of the Republican party of said county, and that the election returns for the said county and senatorial district for many years past generally show <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>that the voters of the Republican party have numbered a large majority.</p>

No witnesses were produced and no depositions were taken in court to sustain the petition, and no opportunity for cross-examination was ever afforded. The defendant, however, was supported by six affidavits, made by citizens of Chester County, in which the facts set forth in the petition were recited in the same words, and it is upon the petition and these affidavits that the defendant rests his case. Not a single specific act or word by any one, which would reasonably give rise to the opinion that a fair trial could not be had in Chester County, appears; and the allegations in the petition and affidavits are based solely upon the mental conclusions of the parties that, because the plaintiff is and has been prominent in Republican politics in the county and because he received a majority of the votes cast at the election held shortly after the alleged slanderous words were uttered, the inferences asserted naturally arise. It is not claimed by the defendant that a single juror summoned to attend this court has been in any way influenced by the plaintiff’s candidacy or his position.</p>

On November 1, 1916, Mr. Berry came into the County of Chester to oppose his election, and, at a public meeting, uttered the alleged untrue and slanderous words contained in the plaintiff’s statement. There is no evidence that these charges were the main issue before the voters of the district at that election, and, presumably, they were not, as they were made only six days before the election actually took place. But, be that as it may, it is admitted that, at the election, Mr. Eyre received 10,-209 votes, and his opponent 9,753 votes, and that Mr. Eyre, therefore, was elected. The small majority of <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>456 which the plaintiff received would seem to indicate that neither his leadership nor the large normal Republican vote of the county entered potentially into the contest. How many of the citizens of the district did not vote for any candidate has not been shown, and it is likely that, with many who did not vote at the election at all, the vote received by the plaintiff was in fact a minority of the total vote of the county.</p>

It would seem, from his petition, that either his or other <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>arguments were effective; for, if it be true, that the voters of the county are largely Republican in politics, then it follows that the vote received by the opponent of Mr. Eyre must have come, to a large extent, from those who are generally of that persuasion. Of course, he may say that he has since changed his mind in this respect; but has the real situation been altered, except that now a smaller and more select tribunal, taken from the same electorate, has been called upon to pass on the truth or good faith of his conduct in making the charges? He seemingly then had confidence in the plaintiff’s constituency, and what good reason has arisen to change his opinion and to cause him to doubt the fairness of these same citizens, has not been satisfactorily explained to me. How the gentlemen in the jury panel voted, or to what political party they usually belong, is now of no importance, nor can such matters at this time be inquired into. It may be that, for various reasons entirely outside of Mr. Berry’s charges, some of them voted for and some against the plaintiff; but, even if this be so, ought the court on pure suspicion, find that, because of the election and the plaintiff’s standing, there is a likelihood that some of those called into the jury box will, contrary to their oaths, be unduly influenced in a case wherein it plainly appears that they have no personal interest, and at best only a general political concern?</p>

If the statements made by Mm are true, he is in no jeopardy, for, under such circumstances, it will be the duty of the court <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>to direct a verdict in Ms favor. If lie fails to prove their truth, but shows by facts not to be disputed, that they were made on a proper occasion, from a proper motive, in a proper manner, and based on reasonable and probable cause, it will be the duty of the court to so instruct the jury. Or, if the latter facts depend upon the evidence, the court must say to the jury that, if they so find, a verdict shall have to be rendered in his favor. Only if he made untrue charges recklessly or with actual malice, without good faith, or in an improper manner, will he become liable; for the occasion was privileged, and he is entitled to rest on that privilege, unless, in some way or other, he had forfeited the right. I see no reason whatsoever, under the circumstances, why a jury from the county in which the statements were made should not pass upon these questions of fact, if they arise, with the same impartial fairness that they would be passed upon in any other jurisdiction.</p>

Then, too, Mr. Berry has also been a candidate before the people, and has served in high public office in the State. He may perhaps be better known in the adjoining counties, to one of which the case would be transferred, than the plaintiff, and it can, therefore, be equally urged as against him that he might thus obtain an unfair advantage. Taking all the facts, therefore, into consideration, it seems to me that the fairest way is to let the parties fight out their contest exactly where it arose.</p>

It would be a waste of time to try such an issue before a jury, if it should be sent back for a retrial on this account. If such should be the result, the apparent delay attending a present continuance would undoubtedly prove more fanciful than real. Then, too, in the recent case of Pennsylvania Railroad Company v.
