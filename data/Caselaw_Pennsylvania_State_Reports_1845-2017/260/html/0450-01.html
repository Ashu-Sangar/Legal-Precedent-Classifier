Plaintiff commenced a suit in assumpsit for the recovery of such amount. A year later defendant was adjudged a bankrupt, and a month thereafter applied for his discharge. While the decision on such application was pending the court stayed the proceedings in the suit in assumpsit, at the instance of the defendant; after such stay plaintiff brought attachment proceedings in another county where property had been bequeathed to defendant and filed a statement of claim there and obtained judgment for want of an affidavit of defense. Three months later defendant took a rule to open the judgment. It appeared that the stay of proceedings in the first suit and the proof of the claim' in the bankruptcy proceedings, might have misled the defendant, and further that defendant had no means to employ counsel. The judgment was thereafter opened and defendant let into a defense, the order of the court preserving the lien of the attachment. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

The evidence at the trial may show a sufficient excuse. The defendant should have an opportunity to present this defense unless his default is without excuse. True, the set-off arises under a prior sale made by the plaintiff and not under the contract upon which suit is now brought, but the transactions between the plaintiff and defendant continued during a long term, so that one order for goods cannot well be separated and treated as independent from the others. The letters passing between the parties referred to both contracts. But unliquidated damages arising, ex contractu, from any bargain may <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>be set off under our Dafalcation Act, whenever they are capable of liquidation by any known legal standard: Hunt v.

    <p class="summary" id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[274,1005,1147,1191]]]'>We think some excuse for the delay may be found in the fact, that there was no service, although the judgment may have been legally entered under the provisions of the statute. The stay of the proceedings in the Philadelphia court on a suit to collect the same claim and the fact that the plaintiff proved his debt in the bankruptcy proceedings may have misled the defendant into the belief that the case in this court required no supervision. He had disclosed fully his defense, on the merits, in the Philadelphia action. He was a bankrupt and claims he had no means to employ counsel. He contends it was the duty of the trustee in bankruptcy to protect his estate. Courts usually are liberal in opening judgments entered for want of an appearance, where a good defense or excuse is disclosed. This liberality is indicated, when the court declares, that such application to open is not limited to the term at which the judgment was entered: Riegel v. Wilson, <a href="/pa/60/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="60 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1014389" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0388-01">60 Pa. 388</a>, p. 36. “In the nature of the case, there is not and ought not to be any limitation of time to the power of the court to open a judgment entered by default for want of an appearance” : Breden v.

This was a controverted matter for some years, but in Crawford v. Burke, 195, U.

This lien, as already stated, we can protect in our opening order.
