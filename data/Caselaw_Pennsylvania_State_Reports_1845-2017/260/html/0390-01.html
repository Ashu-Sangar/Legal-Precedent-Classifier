In an action to recover for the death of plaintiff’s husband occasioned by a head-on collision between two automobiles, in one of which he was seated, the case was for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiff will be sustained where it appears that deceased was a salesman whose duty it was to dispose of the cargo of the car in which he was riding; and that it was the duty of the driver thereof to' carry the goods to the customers and help to unload them, and that the deceased had nothing to do with the actual driving of the automobile; that the collision occurred early on a dark, rainy and foggy morning; that three lights were burning on the truck in which deceased rode and the driver thereof sounded a warning of his approach; that the lights on the defendant’s truck were not burning and its horn was not blown; and there was conflicting evidence as to the negligence of the chauffeur of the truck in which deceased was riding, and as to the speed of the two cars.</p>

There were three lights burning on the front of the truck in which deceased was riding and the driver thereof sounded his horn just before the collision. There were no lights on the front of defendant’s truck, which gave no warning of its approach. When the two trucks collided, the truck in which deceased rode rebounded about fifteen feet.

    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.7",424,[251,567,1159,1575]]]'>Under the evidence' submitted by the plaintiff, the. negligence of the defendant’s chauffeur was for the jury, and they were instructed by the learned trial judge three or four times that unless they found he had negligently operated his employer’s automobile there could be no recovery by the widow of the deceased. One of the contentions of the appellant is that the collision was due to the negligence of the chauffeur who operated the automobile in which the deceased was riding, and, as such negligence was imputable to him, there can be no recovery. As to this the following instruction was given to the jury, to which no exception was taken: “It appears from, the evidence that he [the deceased] and the driver of the automobile had their respective duties; he to dispose of the cargo as salesman, and the driver to carry the goods to the customers and to help to unload them; that the deceased man,had nothing to do with the actual driving of the automobile. Do you believe that there was anything that the deceased man did or omitted to do that, had he done it or omitted to do it, would have avoided this accident? That is for you under the evidence. If he could have done anything to have avoided the accident, anything that any reasonably prudent and careful man would have done under the circumstances, and did not do it, then he would be guilty of contributory negligence, and if he was guilty of contributory negligence, then no matter whether either or both the chauffeurs were guilty of negligence, his widow, the plaintiff here, could not recover.”</p>
