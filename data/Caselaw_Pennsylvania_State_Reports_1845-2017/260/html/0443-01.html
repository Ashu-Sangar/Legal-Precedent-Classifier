    <p class="syllabus" id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[159,1077,1150,778]]]'>A testator bequeathed to a trustee $300,000 “to hold the same in trust for the sole and separate use of my daughter......during her natural life, and from and after her decease to hold the same to and for the use and benefit of such child or children as she may leave,” payment of income to be made only on her individual receipt or order. The trustee was given active duties to perform and was required by the will to exercise discretion as to investments. Testator further provided that in the event of the death of said daughter “without leaving issue, then the said trust-fund of said decedent shall revert to and form part of my residuary estate.” The residue was given to a charity. The daughter, who had become discovert and had issue living, petitioned for the termination of the trust alleging that the trust was dry and that under the rule in Shelley’s Case she had an absolute interest in the fund. The lower court decided that the trust was an active one, that the issue of the daughter took by purchase, not by inheritance, and dismissed the petition. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

Jenks, had intended to use the words “sole and separate use” in the restricted sense of a trust for her during coverture only, it is unlikely that he would have used the same words in creating a similar trust for his son; an examination of the will shows, however, beyond a doubt, that the protection of his daughter’s estate from the control of her husband (now dead) was only one of the objects which the testator had in mind; for the gift is in trust “during her natural life”; it is safeguarded by a provision that payments of income shall be made only on her individual receipt or order (see Boyd’s Est. No. 1, <a href="/pa/199/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="199 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="922742" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0487-01">199 Pa. 487</a>, 491) ; the trustee has active duties to perform ; he is required by the will to exercise a discretion as to the retention of investments, and finally, the will provides that in the event of the death of Mrs. Jenks without issue, the trust fund shall revert to and form part of the testator’s residuary estate which he gave to' the University of Pennsylvania; ■ and this, of itself, is sufficient reason for sustaining the trust, as it is well established that a trust for the protection of a future interest <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>is valid and will not be stricken down even in the case of a superimposed trust for a separate use (Denis’s Est., <a href="/pa/201/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="201 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="925712" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0616-01">201 Pa. 616</a>; see also Harrison’s Est., <a href="/pa/227/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="227 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1008541" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0134-01">227 Pa. 134</a>; Knight’s Est., <a href="/pa/235/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="235 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="984822" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0149-01">235 Pa. 149</a>).</p>

It might have saved at least part of the discussion if the testator had expressly stated that the issue of a deceased child of his daughter should take the share the parent would have taken if living, but a gift to children has frequently been held to include grandchildren (see Campbell’s Est., <a href="/pa/202/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="202 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="992293" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0459-01">202 Pa. 459</a>), and it is a reasonable assumption that the testator had such grandchildren in mind when, in the subsequent part of the will, he used the word “issue.” That a testator’s intention is controlling requires no citation of authority; in the present instance we find nothing to show that the testator intended the remaindermen to take by inheritance from the beneficiary of the life estate, which is <em>a </em>
      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>prerequisite to the application of the rule in Shelley’s Case (see Stout v.
