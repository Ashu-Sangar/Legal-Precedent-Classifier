On the trial of a sci. fa. sur mortgage, it appeared that at the time of the execution and delivery of the mortgage, the mortgagor, desiring to keep secret the fact that the mortgage had been executed, stipulated that it should not be sued out until after his death, and to that end did not have the instrument witnessed or recorded. Subsequently at the request of the mortgagee the mortgagor had the mortgage put in a duly authenticated form for recording, the mortgagee writing over his signature the condition that the mortgage should become void if recorded during the mortgagor’s lifetime. Thereafter the mortgage was recorded in the mortgagor’s lifetime without the knowledge of the mortgagor. The mortgagee proceeded to foreclose after the mortgagor’s death. <em>Held, </em>the mortgage was automatically extinguished when it was recorded, and judgment was properly entered for the defendant n. o. v.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b565-8" data-blocks='[["BL_565.13",565,[166,1166,1148,699]]]'>On the trial of this case we mistakenly viewed the condition, that the mortgage should be void if recorded in the mortgagor’s lifetime, as a provision reaching the debt itself and thus exacting an unconscionable penalty from the mortgagee, causing him to forfeit to the mortgagor a large sum of money, manifestly greatly in excess of any damages that possibly could arise to the mortgagor by the recording of the mortgage. As such a penalty could not be enforced, 3d Parson’s Contracts, 156; Emery v. Boyle, <a href="/pa/200/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="924369" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0249-01">200 Pa. 249</a>; as under such a provision the recording of the mortgage would merely entitle the mortgagor to such damages as he could prove arose from the act of recording, we directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

The mortgage conveyed to the mortgagee an estate as security for the payment of the mortgagor’s debt: McLaughlin v. Ihmsen, <a href="/pa/85/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="85 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="440529" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0364-01">85 Pa. 364</a>. It was not an absolute conveyance; a reversion of the title to the mortgagor on payment of the debt was contemplated, and therefore, the provision <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>for an earlier reversion in the event of the mortgage being recorded prematurely, is good and effectual.</p>

In estates for life or years, conditions in restraint of alienation are lawful. Such restraint is good by reason of a reversion remaining in the lessor.” The Law of Eeal Property in conveyancing, Jones Sec. 664.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[283,953,1148,958]]]'>This is simply the case of a contract, a mortgagee positively stipulating that it shall terminate, become void, upon the mortgagee’s doing a certain thing, which he subsequently does. “As forfeitures are not favored either in equity or in law, provisions for forfeitures are to receive, when the intent is doubtful, a strict construction against those for whose benefit they are introduced. Courts are reluctant to declare and enforce a forfeiture if, by reasonable interpretation, it can be avoided....... Forfeitures are enforced only where there is clearest evidence that that was what was meant by the stipulation of the parties”: 6 Euling Case Law, 906; “Conditions providing for disabilities and forfeitures are to receive, when the intent is doubtful, a strict construction against those for whose benefit they are introduced”: Hoffman v.

Manifestly tbe mortgagee believed it was, and in fact it was, of substantial value and advantage to bim to thus have tbe mortgage duly authenticated and put in form for recording. In consideration of tbis real and valuable improvement of tbe mortgage, earnestly desired and sought by tbe mortgagee, be wrote upon it over bis signature, the condition that it should become, not voidable, but voidj if recorded during tbe mortgagor’s life, thereby, we believe, as fully incorporating tbis condition with tbe mortgage as if originally therein written.</p>
