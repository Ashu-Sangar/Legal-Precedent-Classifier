Potts, one of the trustees, as compensation as trustee, • upon, the ground that the amount of said payment was excessive and that the sum allowed the said trustee as compensation for his services as such should be only an amount which would fairly represent the value of the services actually performed.” Mr. Shaw, one of the accounting trustees, has received no compensation and asks for none. He waived all rights to compensation by reason of an agreement between him and the Assets company, whereby that company agreed to relieve him of certain obligations which it claimed he had assumed..</p>

The trustees also collected securities of the Copper Company <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>and its subsidiaries. The most conservative estimate of the value of these securities is $1,250,000. Part of these securities have been sold for approximately $590,000. The unconverted collateral still in their hands is worth at least $500,000. At the time the account was filed the trustees had acted under this agreement for a period of almost three and one-half years. Doubtless much of the detail work of the trust was performed by the syndicate managers, counsel and by Edward S. Dunn, who acted as agent for the trustees. The trustees have had physical custody of the assets-during the continuance of the trust and their duties have involved many consultations with counsel and with the'syndicate managers in New York. The responsibility and worry involved in the handling of assets of such great value, the sale of part of the same, changes in the collateral, and such details as the trustees personally attended to, have been great.</p>
