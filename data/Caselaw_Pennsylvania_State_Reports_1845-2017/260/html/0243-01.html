The words of the statute plainly disclose a purpose, first, to grant a remedy, under which a trial judge cannot arbitrarily prevent the notation of a general <em>exception; </em>and, second, to guard against the abuse of +he remedy, thus afforded, by compelling counsel to state in a general way the grounds of their objections.</p>

If the charge is deemed to over-emphasize one side of the case to the injury of the other, all that needs to be stated is that fact. If the charge be deemed misleading, unfair or inadequate, all that needs to be stated is a brief <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>reason to that effect. If there are particular errors of fact or of law, their mere statement complies with the statutory requirement, and may, in many instances, operate to have them immediately corrected, and prevent a mistrial. [If points for charge are simply affirmed or refused, a mere declaration that counsel excepts will suffice]. The requirement seems, therefore, to be eminently reasonable; moreover, entirely apart from its reasonableness, the plain language of the statute leaves no room for doubt as to its intent.”</p>

The words of the statute plainly disclose a purpose, first, to grant a remedy, under which a trial judge cannot arbitrarily prevent the notation of a general exception; and, second, to guard against abuse of the remedy, thus afforded, by compelling counsel to state generally the grounds of their objections. While the language used in the latter connection is not imperative in form, yet, it is clear, a ruling that the requirement in question is not mandatory would defeat the legislative intent that a trial judge shall always, at least in a general way, be informed of the reasons why his instructions are objected to, so that he may make proper corrections. If this were not the purpose of the language employed, then there would be no sense in the express provision for the statement of reasons, therefore that provision can be read properly as a requirement; and, considering the words of the act, as well as the deprivation contained therein of the historic right of a judge to determiné every request for an exception, it should be so construed. In fact, the proper maintenance of the long established and just rule that a trial court will not be reviewed on matters in no way called to its attention, unless for basic and fundamental error imperatively calling for reversal, requires that the provision in question be so construed. On a general exception, taken under and in accordance with <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>the requirements of this act, the appellant may assign all errors which, by liberal interpretation, properly can be said either to fall within or be suggested by the reasons stated when taking the exception and, in addition, such controlling fundamental errors of law as above referred to.</p>

If this can be called a departure at all, it is an immaterial one, for, had the gates not been carelessly operated after plaintiff was invited and started to cross defendant’s railroad, there would have been no accident, and defendant is accountable for all the consequences naturally following from its original wrongful act; hence, the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury was not the very natural effort which she made to save herself from apparent imminent danger, but the negligent lowering of defendant’s safety gates.
