At a trial for murder, it appeared that deceased and defendant had lived in the same boarding house; that one evening, defendant and several others were assembled in the dining room; that deceased walked up to a member of the group and said that he wanted to say something to him and beckoned him to follow; that the two walked into the yard when defendant appeared and shot deceased without warning, killing him; a stiletto, three loaded cartridges, and a razor were found upon deceased, and a pistol near the spot where the dead body lay. Thereafter, defendant admitted the killing and gave himself up to a constable. Defendant testified that he left the room for the purpose of going into the yard; that he saw deceased and the man whom he had called standing together; that when deceased saw him, he pulled his hand out of his overcoat pocket and defendant saw a revolver; and that when he saw that revolver, he pulled his revolver and shot; that he was so seared, when he fired the first shot, a minute or two afterwards he fired the second; defendant offered to prove that deceased had conversed with him about nine days prior to the killing; had said that he was a member of the Black Hand Gang, and had been sent to murder defendant for the reason that defendant had previously killed a member of that organization; that deceased could fix the matter up and prevent defendant from being killed if he would pay <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>Mm $200; and if he did not pay deceased $200, deceased would kill defendant; that defendant promised deceased $200; that he knew deceased was a member of the Black Hand Gang, and that the Black Hand Gang was a society that extorted money under threat of murder; that defendant believed if he did not give deceased $200, the latter would kill him, but that he had not given him the money; that the night of the killing was the first and only opportunity deceased had to do defendant harm. Defendant further offered to prove that he had gone to a local constable to ask for protection. The lower court excluded the offers of evidence. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence should have been admitted.</p>

The dividing line between self-defense and voluntary manslaughter brought about through the influence of a passion of fear, seems to be the existence, as the moving force, of a reasonably founded belief of either imminent peril to life or great bodily harm, as distinguished from the influence of an uncontrollable fear or terror, conceivable as existing but not reasonably justified by the immediate circumstances. If the circumstances are both adequate to raise and sufficient to justify a belief in the necessity to take life in order to save one’s self from such a danger, where the belief exists and is acted upon, the homicide is excusable upon the theory of self-defense; while, if the act is committed under the influence of an uncontrollable fear of either death or bodily harm, <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>caused by tbe circumstances, but without the presence of all the ingredients necessary to excuse the act on the ground of self-defense, the hilling is manslaughter.</p>

In short, the defense was that, while, at the moment of the shooting, Principatti intended to kill Amodeo, yet such intention was instantaneously impelled by the former’s belief that he was in imminent danger of death, or it was the result of a passion of fear, influenced by Amodeo’s previous threats, but immediately caused by the sight of the pistol in the hands of the deceased.</p>

In the latter connection we recently said: “The dividing line between self-defense and this character of manslaughter [voluntary, brought about through the influence of a passion of fear] seems to be the existence, as the moving force, of a reasonably founded belief of either imminent peril to life or great bodily harm, as distinguished from the influence of an uncontrollable fear or terror, conceivable as existing but not reasonably justified by the immediate circumstances. If the circumstances are both adequate to raise and sufficient to justify a belief in the necessity to- take life in order to save one’s self from such danger, where the belief exists and is acted upon, the homicide is excusable upon the theory of self-defense......; while, if the act is committed under the influence of an uncontrollable fear of either death or great bodily harm, caused by the circumstances, but without the presence of all the ingredients necessary to excuse the act on the ground of self-defense, the killing is manslaughter”: Com. v. Colandro, <a href="/pa/231/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="231 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="973928" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0343-01">231 Pa. 343</a>, 352.</p>

Apparently, the trial was conducted upon the theory that the deceased was not accused by the defendant of any actual menacing action at the time of or immediately before the killing, hence the latter’s alleged fear rested upon no sufficient foundation; but'this ignored the testimony of defendant that, when he came out of the kitchen door, just before the shooting, Amodeo turned toward him, at the same moment drawing a revolver which he, the prisoner, saw in the hands of the deceased. This fact, by itself, would not be sufficient to show a pro<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>vocation which would justify killing in self-defense, or even such a passion of fear as to reduce the alleged crime to manslaughter; but, keeping in mind the rule of law that, in a case involving prior threats, one is “justified in acting on a hostile demonstration of much less pronounced character than if such threats had not preceded” the killing (21 Cyc. 893), it is quite conceivable that, if the competent testimony as to other relevant facts offered by defendant (i. e., concerning prior threats and the wicked character of the man who made them, the latter’s connection with the “Black Hand Society,” the nature of that society, and the resulting fear which pursued the defendant) had been given an opportunity to be heard and considered, the jury might have drawn conclusions therefrom favorable to the defendant, which would have affected the verdict.</p>

When certain other persons were called by defendant to prove the character of Amodeo, the trial judge refused their testimony on the ground that these particular-witnesses had no personal acquaintance with the deceased; this was error; It ir; not necessary to know one personally in order to have sufficient acquaintance with his reputation to give testimony concerning it; and this is so whenever one’s character or reputation is properly at issue. Here, the reputation of the man killed by defendant was in question, for Principatti claimed that, because of the threats against his life made by Amodeo, when, immediately before the killing, he saw the pistol in the latter’s hand, this, coupled with his knowledge of the reputation of the deceased as a “Black Hander” and dangerous man, raised a fear in defendant’s mind, which influenced him to shoot at once for his own protection (21 Cyc. 889, par. “c,” and p. 956, par. II; Underhill on Criminal Evidence, p. 386, sec. <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>324). Of course, it is always essential that one whose character is at issue shall be properly identified by those called to testify concerning it, so that the court may be satisfied no mistake occurs regarding the identity of the person; but, after this is made sure, then the proof of reputation is subject to the same rules of evidence as prevail when establishing the character of a defendant or any one else: Underhill on Criminal Evidence, sec. 325. Before leaving this branch of the case, it is but fair to state that, so far as the assignments show, the witnesses in question were asked concerning the reputation of Amodeo only as “a bad and dangerous man”; strictly, this might be objectionable because the word “violent,” or its equivalent, is not used; but the ground upon which the testimony was excluded, i. e., lack of a personal acquaintance with deceased, was clearly wrong.</p>

This man, however, refused to testify unless all other Italians were removed from the room, claiming he was afraid vengeance would be visited upon him if his testimony were heard by them. Upon objection from the district attorney, the trial judge said: “The court is of opinion that it does not have the power to grant the application; therefore, the objection to so doing is sustained.” A request of this character is.within the discretion of the trial judge, and had the court below, in the exercise of its discretion, refused the one at bar, we would be loath to characterize such a ruling as reversible error; but, clearly, in the present instance the judge was wrong in ruling that he had no power to grant the application: "Archbold’s Criminal Practice and Pleading (8th ed.), vol.

Although these omissions are possibly corrected by the affirmance of certain of the latter’s requests, at the next trial all such material matters should be specifically referred to in the body of the charge; moreover, at that time, the trial judge should be careful not only to state all appropriate rules of law, but to point out their relevancy with sufficient explicitness to enable the jury intelligently to apply the law to the facts as it may find the látter to be: <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>Com. v.
