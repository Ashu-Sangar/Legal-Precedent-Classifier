L. 324, empowered the City of Philadelphia to construct sewers in the streets of the city, and to charge therefor the sum of $.75 for each lineal foot, against each front, the same to be recovered as liens for the laying of water pipe were then recovered in the city, and with the same allowance for comer lots. The Act of March 30, 1866, P. L. 354, repealed the Act of 1864, so far as the limitation of the amount of the charge was concerned and provided that “Thereafter all the said charges and rates shall be fixed, from time to time, by ordinance of councils.” By general ordinance of February 16, 1869, the charge was fixed at $1.50 per lineal foot. In view of the numerous decisions directly on the point, the validity of these acts and the general ordinance of 1869 is not an open question: City of Philadelphia v.

Philadelphia, supra. It does not necessarily follow from the nonapplicability of the Act of 1864 to streets laid out, but not opened, that the city was without power to construct this sewer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[265,1176,1154,1249]],["BL_299.1",299,[191,342,1150,1581]]]'>A municipal corporation has power to" make sewers, without any special authority given with that view: Fisher v. Harrisburg, <a href="/grant/2/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Grant 291" data-case-ids="227678" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0291-01">2 Grant 291</a>; moreover it is not necessary to rest the decision of the present case in the inherent or implied power of the city to construct a sewer through private property when necessary. This power was expressly given by the Act of Feb. 18,1769,1 Sm. L. 284; was confirmed and continued by the subsequent Acts of March 11, 1789, 2 Sm. L. 462; April 2, 1790, 2 Sm. L. 526, and Feb. 2,1854, P. L. 21 (Bromley v. Philadelphia, 8 Pa. Go. Ct. 600) ; and was not annulled by any later act. There can be no doubt as to the power of the city to construct the sewer, though the street had not been opened to public use, and no question is raised as to the regularity of its exercise. But the city was under no obligation to the abutting property owners to provide a sewer for the drainage of their properties, and consequently was under no obligation to permit them to use it for their purpose, except upon compliance by them with the reasonable conditions which the city councils, in the exercise of a sound discretion, saw fit to impose. The question was directly raised and fully argued in Fisher v. Harrisburg, <a href="/grant/2/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Grant 291" data-case-ids="227678" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0291-01">supra,</a> and was elaborately considered by <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>Judge Pearson of the Common Pleas and by the Supreme Court on writ of error. In sustaining the ordinance Judge Pearson said, p. 293: “Every by-law must be reasonable; or rather taken negatively, it must not be unreasonable. We can see nothing unreasonable in requiring those who use a drain to pay for its use.” Later in his opinion he said: “We have no doubt of the power of the borough officers to fix, by law, the price which shall be paid for using this sewer, as well as for a stall in the market house; and neither is in the nature of a tax.” On writ of error this just and equitable doctrine was fully affirmed by the Supreme Court in the following terms: “A municipal corporation has power to make sewers, without any special authority given with that view; and, having made them, it may, by general rules, independent of its general taxing power, regulate the use of them and the price at which any private person may tap them, and protect them by proper penalties, against invasion or injury.” So here, while the condition imposed by the ordinance of January 9, 1908, is not supported by the city’s power of taxation, it is supported by an equally well and established power. The reasonableness of the amount that the property owners must pay to obtain permission to use the sewer is not brought in question by the pleadings; but it is not out of place to remark that the condition that he shall pay the same amount per foot front as abutters on sewers laid in opened city streets are required to pay (which is what the provision of the ordinance amounts to) is not prima facie unreasonable.</p>

Nor is it perceived that an invidious discrimination is made against anyone by the ordinance, or that there is any improper classification. All persons are treated alike; therefore the principle recognized and applied in Bowser v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa-super/41/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="41 Pa. Super. 515" data-case-ids="884166" data-case-paths="/pa-super/41/0515-01">41 Pa. Superior Ct. 515</a>, does not control. It is to be observed <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>in conclusion, that the limitations of the powers conferred upon municipal corporations are that they must be exercised in a reasonable, lawful and constitutional manner. “If these limitations are not transgressed, courts cannot interfere with the ordinances of the municipality, for the mayor and council must be left to a reasonable discretion, and, for the proper and wholesome exercise thereof, they are accountable not to the courts, but to the people they represent.” O’Maley v. Borough of Freeport, <a href="/pa/96/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="96 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="494661" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0024-01">96 Pa. 24</a>; Wilkes-Barre v.
