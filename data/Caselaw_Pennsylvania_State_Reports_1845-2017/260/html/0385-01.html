French and children.” Certain of the legatees named in Item Sixth died before the termination of the life estates. Held, that the legatees named in Item Sixth took vested, not contingent remainders.</p>

Elbert, the half of my residuary estate and Harry B. French and children the other half.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b418-5" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[268,1022,1151,863]]]'>It is quite obvious that when the testatrix at the end of the fifth clause referred to her heirs at law as named in item sixth of her will, she did not use the words in their technical sense, for the persons named were not her heirs at law. Some of her heirs were not mentioned, qnd some of the persons named were riot her heirs at law at all. What she meant by “heirs” was the legatees whom she designated by name. “Heirs” in a will, especially a will written as was this inops consillii is often used in its popular sense to include legatees or devisees who are made heirs by the will: Hoff’s App., <a href="/pa/28/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="981668" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0051-01">28 Pa. 51</a>; Widmeyer’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=45%20Pitts%20L.J.%20208" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="45 Pitts L.J. 208">45 Pitts. L. J. 208</a>. The word was used in this sense also in the eighth item of this will. The meaning is, of course, a question of intention.

      <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>We are of opinion that the remainders given to the legatees named in item sixth were vested and not contingent upon their surviving Emily H. Stocker, who died on June 18, 1913. The gift to the legatees was one that would necessarily take effect in possession upon the termination of the preceding life estates and subject to no other conditions save that termination so far as the express words of the will afford an indication of the testamentary purpose. There is no gift to a class, for the legatees are named individually with the proportions exactly stated in which they are to share the estate, and there is an. entire absence of any words expressive of survivorship or the like.</p>

The argument in favor of the contingency turns on the phraseology that the estate shall “pass and vest in my heirs at law at that time,” i. e., the death of the life tenants, and the direction in the sixth item that the property shall be “divided and distributed.” But the will does not say “shall pass and vest at that time to my heirs at law,” the words on which such stress is laid do not immediately follow and thus qualify the word “vest,” or indicate that the period of vesting should be postponed or be subject to a contingency. The normal sense of the word “vest” indeed is to indicate a present and immediate interest as distinguished from one that is contingent. McClellan’s Est., <a href="/pa/221/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="221 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="956144" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0261-01">221 Pa. 261</a>, where Judge Ashman, whose opinion was adopted by the Supreme Court, said by way of illustration “an estate in remainder is vested in the rémaindermen, although its enjoyment is deferred until the falling-in of the life estate. Certainly in a will such as the present, it would be dangerous to hold that even if the testatrix had said “vest at that time,” she meant that.no interest should pass but remain contingent until that time. This would impale her intent on a sharp point of <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>law, for what, she most probably meant by vest was to vest in actual use or possession: Phillip’s Est., No. 1, <a href="/pa/205/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="205 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="929987" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0504-01">205 Pa. 504</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[303,508,1150,1302]]]'>We do not discover any intent in the use of the words “to be given and distributed,” that the gift is only implied from the direction to pay, as in Moore v. Smith, <a href="/watts/9/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts 403" data-case-ids="1849953" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0403-01">9 Watts 403</a>, cited by the auditing judge, where the direction was to pay to the legatees “as soon as he arrives at twenty-one years of age.” In Rosengarten v. Ashton, <a href="/pa/228/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="228 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="969908" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0389-01">228 Pa. 389</a>; Moore v.

Mulliken v. Earnshaw, <a href="/pa/209/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="209 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="936199" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0226-01">209 Pa. 226</a>, was a similar case, and totally unlike the present. In the recent case of Rau’s Est., <a href="/pa/254/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="254 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1025421" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0464-01">254 Pa. 464</a>, in which Rosengarten v.

We cannot persuade ourselves that this was the intention of the testatrix; that this is extremely unlikely appears from the fact that the legatees mentioned in the second residuary clause were also included among the legatees in the first. The’intention to give lapsed legacies to-the very persons whose death or the death of some of whom might occasion -the lapse"; would be too' extraordinary to -attribute to any one: ' The cases a're'not infrequent where <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>a testator has employed two residuary clauses, whether from carelessness or stupidity, or some undiscoverable reason, but we are not bound to find a meaning for that which is insensible, or what is worse, strain the will in order to create an intestacy so that the second residuary clause may have something to operate on.</p>
