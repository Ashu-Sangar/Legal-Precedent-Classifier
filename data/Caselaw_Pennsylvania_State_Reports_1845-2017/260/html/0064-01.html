When thus viewed, the record is ample to sustain the verdict and judgment for plaintiff so far as they relate to the first branch of this case; but there are several assignments alleging trial errors, in connection with the part of the controversy we have been considering, which require determination,</p>

      <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>The third assignment complains of a ruling on the evidence. The defendant produced a former employee, and endeavored to have him testify concerning what was stated in one of its books of account upon the subject of the rate of interest to be paid plaintiff. With this book before him, the witness was asked, “Does that page state the rate of interest on the account?” Counsel for plaintiff objected, saying, “We have no objection to their showing the amounts of interest actually entered, but we do not think their own statement of [the rate of interest] is proper.” This objection was sustained, and an exception noted. It is to be observed that the entries were not being used to refresh the witness’s memory, and that no offer was made of the book in question as an independent piece of evidence; moreover, the entries in plaintiff’s pass book are a transcript from defendant’s ledger, and it was admitted at the trial that they showed interest at the rate of two per cent., not four per cent., annually. Under the circumstances, we do not see that error was committed by the ruling complained of, or that the defendant was prejudiced thereby. A memorandum on defendant’s ledger, not disclosed to plaintiff, to the effect that the account was to bear interest at two per cent., even if an entry of that character were there (and we find no offer upon the record to prove such to be the case), would not be evidence against plaintiff to disprove the contract alleged by him concerning the rate of interest, either as part of the res gestas or upon any other proper theory: Murphy v. McMullin, <a href="/pa/219/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="219 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1002753" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0506-01">219 Pa. 506</a>; Hottle v.

The entry referred to does not state upon its face the rate of interest or the time from which it was calculated; therefore, even if the jury believed it to have been made on the date contended for by defendant, this would not raise “a legal presumption” that plaintiff knew the interest was computed at two per cent, per annum. All the accompanying circumstances were for the jurors to consider, and from them they might have inferred that plaintiff did in point of fact have the knowledge which defendant claims he possessed, but they were not bound in law so-to do. The verdict, however, comprehends a finding, in no way influenced by the alleged error now under consideration, to the effect that the entry in question was not made in plaintiff’s pass book until March 25, 1914; this being the case, it is apparent that the answer here complained of did the defendant no harm, even if the request had been a proper one, which clearly it was not.</p>

Plaintiff’s amended statement of claim contains an allegation that the interest is payable semiannually, and, in connection with the point now before us, defendant attempts to make much of this assertion; but it is evident the averment in question means simply that twice in each year interest is to be calculated upon and added to plaintiff’s account, and not that it accrues at these times as a separate demand. “Interest, in its very nature, is but an incident of a debt” (Heath v. Page, <a href="/pa/63/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="63 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1018905" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0108-01">63 Pa. 108</a>, 121), and ordinarily it is not compounded (Stokely v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/34/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="34 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="417936" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0210-01">34 Pa. 210</a>), yet here, from time to time, the defendant appears actually <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>to have increased the corpus by adding accumulated interest, thereafter allowing interest upon the principal thus enlarged, in accordance with the custom of savings funds. In other words, the entries in plaintiff’s pass book show that defendant did not in any sense treat the interest items as separate debts, but merely as increments of the principal deposit. A few cases may be found wherein, under contracts stipulating for annual payments of interest, it was held that “so much of the interest as accrued more than the statutory period before action brought is barred, notwithstanding the principal debt may not be barred” (22 Cyc. 1574; Dearborn v. Parks, <a href="/me/5/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Me. 81" data-case-ids="8740021" data-case-paths="/me/5/0081-01">5 Me. 81</a>, 86); but the facts in these cases differentiate them from a case such as the one at bar, which has to do with an interest-bearing bank or savings fund account, where the engagement by the institution is to pay the depositor both principal and interest when, and only when, payment shall be required, even though the interest may be calculated and added to the account at periodic times'. As to such accounts, “the statute does not begin to run......until the principal......becomes due and payable......; the accruing interest from year to year is not thus separated from the principal......, and consequently the statute of limitations does not run upon it until the principal is barred by the statute”; and this is the general rule: 15 R. C. L. 15; Grafton Bk. v. Doe, <a href="/vt/19/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="19 Vt. 463" data-case-ids="4422286" data-case-paths="/vt/19/0463-01">19 Vt. 463</a>, 467; DeCordova v.

Cas. 292, and note. It is settled in our State that the statute of limitations does not apply to a bank deposit until demand has been made, for the debt is not due till then: see Gardner’s Est., <a href="/pa/228/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="228 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="969810" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0282-01">228 Pa. 282</a>, 286, and cases there cited. This rule refers to both principal and interest, and, if the contract in the present case is to pay interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum, as the jury has found it to be, then, on the facts at bar, plaintiff is entitled to recover at that rate for the full period of the deposit, without regard to the <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>statute of limitations. The cases cited by defendant relate to debts payable in installments, periodic settlements with balances formally struck, and accounts stated; they have no controlling application here.

Plaintiff admits that most of the additional work in question was- done at his suggestion, and that, for his services rendered at the beginning thereof, he orally agreed to charge only the commission of five per cent, mentioned in the above quoted letter. In this connection, he testified, “When I persuaded the directors to break into the front building, remove the rear wall and connect up so as to improve the new addition, Mr. Dewar [of the defendant corporation] asked me whether that would be in the commission of five per cent.......I said, ‘Yes, for ■that particular part, we would let that go with the origi<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>nal work’ ”; but plaintiff contends that he never agreed to do the subsequent work in the bank building proper on the five per cent, basis, stating in his testimony: “Never at any time after that [the conversation just quoted] did Mr. Dewar or any of the directors of this bank ask me what my commissions would be. I particularly cautioned Mr. Hansell [of the defendant corporation], when they got into this remodeling work, step by step, that I expected to be paid for my work, for the extra work and trouble they were putting me to; that it was the most particular kind of Avork and required a great deal of care. I told Mr. Hansell twice at my office, because I didn’t want to go along and not warn them that they would have to pay more than perhaps a straight-away job.” On the other hand, defendant produced several witnesses who testified positively that plaintiff agreed to do all of the work in controversy for a five per cent, compensation, to be calculated as mentioned in his original contract.</p>

Here, however, the evidence upon the subject in hand not only preponderates against plaintiff, but it is entirely inadequate to show any contract, either express or implied, fixing a basis of compensation different from that named in plaintiff’s original undertaking with defendant, i. e., five <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>per cent. The testimony relied upon, before quoted, is merely to the effect that plaintiff cautioned defendant he expected to be paid for his extra work, not that he demanded a higher rate of pay than previously fixed upon in the original contract of employment; and, under the circumstances, this was not enough to put defendant on notice that it would be required to pay more than five per centum of the proper cost of the whole job.</p>
    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[247,797,1147,968]]]'>We can not say, however, that plaintiff was entitled only to; the sum allowed him in defendant’s affidavits of defense (as set forth in our next paragraph) ; for the amount of compensation to be recovered depends upon the proper cost of remodeling defendant’s old building, which (unless the parties can agree upon it and thereby avoid a new trial) must be found by a jury. On the evidence as it stood at the last trial, defendant was entitled to an instruction that no understanding, either express or implied, having been shown by plaintiff to pay him more than the five per cent, mentioned in the original contract of employment, that is the standard of compensation which must guide the jury in rendering their verdict; this, in effect, was the instruction requested, as called to our attention by the eighth and last assignment of error, which is sustained. What we have already written sufficiently covers the other assignments, so it is unnecessary specifically to consider them.</p>

Defendant, in its affidavits of defense, admitted liability for the deposit, with two <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>per cent, per annum'interest thereon, the $1,500 commission and $516.95 of the $3,000 claim; for all of which, prior to trial, judgment was entered in the sum of $17,-575.27, the suit proceeding to trial on the issues (1). as to the proper rate of interest, and (2) the compensation to which plaintiff is entitled for the work connected with his $3,000 charge. The verdict and judgment thereon cover all of plaintiff’s claims less the $17,575.27 admitted in defendant’s affidavits of defense; but the record contains sufficient data to enable the court below correctly to determine what proportion of the common judgment belongs to each branch of the case. Hence, we shall make the following order:</p>
    <p id="b107-3" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[184,1066,1146,371]]]'>The judgment, to the extent of its relation to the first branch of this case, is affirmed; but, so far as it pertains to the second branch of the controversy, it is reversed with a venire facias de novo. The court below is directed to apportion the award of the jury in accordance with the foregoing opinion and this order; the costs to date to be divided equally between the litigants.</p>
