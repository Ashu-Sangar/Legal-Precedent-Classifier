Appellant further contends that the testimony of the chauffeur, Avho was called as a witness by plaintiff, clearly proved that, at the time in question, he Avas pursuing his own purposes and not the business of his employer; and, moreover, that uncontradicted testimony given by other witnesses, called by the defendant, was to the same effect. Therefore, appellant argues, it is entitled to judgment n. o. v. If, however, this court should not so decide, then appellant contends, in several assignments, that trial errors occurred which call for a reversal with a venire facias de novo.</p>

The defendant, however, refused to concede “that, at the time of the ac<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>cident, the automobile in question was being operated by its servant in the course of his employment.”</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[263,457,1148,794]]]'>To- meet the last mentioned point, plaintiff proved that the particular machine involved in this case was one of a large number of business automobiles owned and used by defendant in the delivery of packages from the latter’s store, and that this car, in common with others, had defendant’s corporate-name painted thereon; that Solovitz was one of the defendant’s regularly employed drivers, whose duty was to deliver merchandise to its customers ; that, on the night here involved, the automobile in question left defendant’s garage at seven o’clock, loaded with packages; that plaintiff was injured about three hours thereafter, in the district covered by these deliveries, and that the car was returned to defendant’s garage by Solovitz, within half an hour following the accident.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[258,1274,1150,915]]]'>The facts just detailed are amply sufficient to take the case to the jury on the issue as to whether or not the chauffeur was acting for the defendant, within the scope of his employment, at the time of the accident; but during the course of the cross-examination of Solovitz, when the latter was on the stand as a witness for plaintiff, defendant developed these facts: That, before handing out the last two packages which he had to deliver, the chauffeur permitted two of his friends, who were in no way connected with the defendant, to ride with him; that these two guests were in the automobile when plaintiff was injured, and remained therein until its return to- defendant’s garage; and that the accident occurred after the last of the deliveries was' made, when the chauffeur was returning the car to the garage by a route which whs somewhat circuitous and appreciably longer than he needed to take for the purpose.</p>

On the other <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>hand, appellee contends that, since he merely called.defendant’s chauffeur to the stand for the purpose of identification, and did not pursue his examination beyond that point, the facts developed on cross-examination, against his objections, must be considered as part of defendant’s, not plaintiff’s, case (Quigley v.

We have repeatedly said that the restraint to be put upon cross-examination is primarily a question for the presiding judge, and that his rulings will not be reversed unless for manifest and material error. • In some of the rulings called to our attention, we are impressed that the learned judge below might have been more liberal, without harm to either side, but we cannot say he committed reversible error; moreover, in practically every instance, the substance of the matter which his restriction eliminated was subsequently brought out by other questions that he permitted. Then again, in most instances, the questions which the court refused to permit, sought to elicit conclusions rather than facts, which form of interrogation is properly subject to objection. During the course of his charge, the trial judge mentioned that the chauffeur had not been questioned by the defendant concerning all the material facts in the case, and he broadly intimated that this might be considered against the latter; but, when defendant’s counsel called attention to the fact that Solo<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>vitz was plaintiff’s, and not defendant’s, witness, further, that many of the questions which defendant had put to him were ruled out by the court, the judge immediately stated to the jury that counsel was right, and, in effect, corrected his charge accordingly. Finally, counsel asked for no further instructions regarding the subject in hand; he did not except to the alleged error and cannot now complain of it.</p>
