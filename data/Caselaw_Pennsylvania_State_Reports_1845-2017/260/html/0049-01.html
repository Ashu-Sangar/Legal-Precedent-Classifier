A testator, leaving a will, which was probated in Westmoreland County, devised his residuary estate to a religious society to erect and maintain an industrial school, and further declared “One portion of said residuary estate will consist of my farm [describing it] upon which I direct that the said Benedictine Society shall erect and set up suitable buildings- and establish a school of an industrial character for the training and education of boys....... In case [the society]......shall not accept the devise......then the same is given......to the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh for the same purpose as mentioned and for no other.” The society having refused the trust, the Catholic Bishop of Pittsburgh was appointed trustee and obtained leave to sell a part of the said real estate and to remove the institution which had been established thereon to the City of Pittsburgh. Certain next of kin of the testator petitioned that such decree be vacated. The lower court refused the petition without evidence. Petitioners contended that the court was bound to assume and find every material allegation of the petitioners in their favor, or else hear testimony thereon, and that the court had no power to remove the trust estate to another <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>county. <em>Held, </em>that tbe petitioners’ allegation that tbe testator intended tbe institution to be erected upon his farm exclusively was not supported by the will, and that the court had power in its discretion to remove the trust estate to another county, if it should deem it desirable to do so, in the absence of any provision in the will expressly or impliedly forbidding such course.</p>

L. 114, which, by its title, is an amendment to the Act of 1855, supra. This Act of 1895 reenacts, almost in totidem verbis, the tenth section of the statute passed in 1855, adding “corporations not for <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>profit” to the list of relators designated therein as entitled to appear in proceedings brought under the statute, and the word “heretofore,” in order to extend the remedy of the legislation to dispositions of property made prior to the date of the act, the evident and only purposes of the amendment being to mate these enlargements. Under the circumstances, this would not have the effect of eliminating either the Act of 1885 or 1889,( supra, but the amendment of 1895 would be qualified by both of these prior statutes, just as the Act of 1855, supra, was theretofore affected by them, since there is no absolute repugnancy between the new parts of the legislation of 1895 and the intermediate acts. It is established that “where a statute merely reenacts the provisions of an earlier one, it is to be read as part of the earlier statute, and not of the reenacting one, if it is in conflict with another passed after the first but before the last act; and therefore it does not repeal by implication the intermediate one” (Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, Section 194); or as expressed in 36 Cyc. 1084, “Nor does a later law, which is merely a reenactment of a former, repeal an intermediate act which qualifies and limits the first one, but such intermediate act will be deemed to remain in force, and to qualify or modify the new act in the same manner as it did the first”; see also Lewis’s Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Section 273, and Searight’s Est., <a href="/pa/163/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="163 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="859034" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0210-01">163 Pa. 210</a>, 216-18. We may add that, even were it held the Act of 1855 was restored in its entirety by the Act of 1895 (which it was not), this would not help the present petitioners; for, as previously shown, they have no standing whatever under the former statute.</p>

While we affirmed the judgment in the Trim case, per curiam, we did not formally adopt the opinion of the court below; and all that was therein said with relation to the Acts of 1855 and 1885, supra, was unnecessary to the decision reached; for the judgment entered rested upon a finding of fact to the effect that the trust in question was not “uncertain,” in the legal sense of that term; hence, there was no necessity for the application of the cy pres doctrine, with which the acts under consideration deal.</p>

It is to be borne in mind, however, that the proceedings under review were not brought for the* purpose of-- removing a derelict trustee, but were instituted, by distant relations of the testator, in order to have the trust declared at an end, so that the fund involved might be distributed among themselves; which would mean the entire frustration of the donor’s purpose to found a public charity, a result never permitted when the general intent of a benefactor can be approximately carried out: Kramph’s Est., <a href="/pa/228/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="228 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="969809" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0455-01">228 Pa. 455</a>, 463.</p>
