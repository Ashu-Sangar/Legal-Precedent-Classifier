A testator devised the residue of his estate to three sons, William, Joseph and Andrew, in trust, to manage the property and to spend so much of the income or principal thereof as might be necessary for making improvements and additions to certain real estate, and out of the income to pay his wife $1,000 annually during her lifetime, and, if in any year the income -should not amount to such sum, the trustees or a majority of them should have the right to pay to her out of the principal such amount as should with the income equal $1,000; and upon the further trust to pay’for the education of Andrew and for his maintenance and support during his education annually such amount as might be necessary for that purpose in the opinion of the other sons, and when Andrew should complete his education then to pay him $1,000 out of the principal as soon as the same could be conveniently realized. Testator further directed that the trust should not terminate during the lifetime of the wife and that after her death it might be terminated at any time by the joint action of any two of the trustees or by the survivor, in case two of the trustees should have died. Testator directed that upon the termination of the trust the residue of his estate then unexpended and undivided should be divided among his three sons equally, their heirs and assigns, the child or children of any deceased child to take the share which the parent if living would have taken “provided, however, that until the trust shall have been terminated neither of my sons shall have the power to sell, assign, transfer, convey or encumber his interest in the principal of said estate or in the income thereof or to anticipate the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>same in any manner and bis interest in the said estate shall not be liable in any manner for his debts......during the continuation of the trust hereby created, and after payment to my wife...... of the annuity hereby charged upon my said estate and after payment to my son Andrew....... of the amount herein provided to be paid during his education, and after payment of all other expenses herein provided for, I direct that the net income shall be divided equally among my three sons.” During the lifetime of the widow an action of ejectment was brought for an undivided one-third interest in certain property included in the devise; plaintiffs, who claimed as the purchasers of the interest of one of the sons, contended that the will did not create a trust, but gave the land to the testator’s sons, subject to the annuities, and that the spendthrift trust clause of the will was.invalid. The lower court entered judgment for defendant. Held, that during the lifetime of the widow the sons were not entitled to possession and the judgment was affirmed without prejudice to the plaintiffs right to assert title to the premises after the death of the widow.</p>

    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.10",166,[273,848,1146,693]]]'>This is an action of ejectment to recover possession of a one-third undivided interest in the National Hotel property at McKeesport. The case turns on the construction of the will of the late Joseph Pierce of that city. In our opinion the will creates an enforcible active trust, at least during the life of the widow; as to that the language of the will could not well be more explicit. A man by avüI can lawfully provide a life annuity for his widow secured by a trust, and is not prevented from so doing because the annuity may be a charge upon land embraced in the trust. Whether he will secure it by a trust or merely as a charge upon land is optional with the testator.</p>
    <p id="Ar2" data-blocks='[["BL_166.11",166,[273,1562,1145,590]]]'>The contention that a valid trust cannot be created where the trustee is the sole beneficiary may be sound, but does not apply here for the trustees are not the sole beneficiaries. The widow is a beneficiary and entitled to her one thousand dollars a year out of the income and if necessary out of the principal of the estate. The fact that trustees may be entitled to a portion of the income does not destroy the trust, nor disable them from acting as such. One may hold property in trust for the use of himself and others: American &amp; English Encyclopedia of Law (2d ed.) 955; 39 Cyc. 248.</p>

We agree with the court below that, “The fact that the three sons of the testator, who are also 'beneficiaries, are made trustees cannot have any effect on the validity of the trust so far as the widow is concerned.” If plaintiffs are entitled to possession they would seem to be also entitled to partition, Avhich would result in a sale of the property, and thus defeat the intent of the testator; and that in the face of the express provision that this property shall not be sold during the life of the widow.</p>
