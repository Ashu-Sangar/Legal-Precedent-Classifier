Kline and Gross. Morgan failed to pay certain of the notes as they became due, which default, under the terms of the mortgage, gave plaintiff the right to retake the machine; and this the latter did through the present writ of replevin.</p>
    <p id="b93-3" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[194,717,1148,591]]]'>Two controlling issues were submitted to the jury: (1) As to the capacity in which the last purchasers acted —whether for themselves or as representatives of the defendant corporation. (2) As to the knowledge of these parties concerning the terms of the original purchase by Morgan from the plaintiff corporation. The verdict of the jury indicates that both issues were found against the plaintiff; but the trial court thought the evidence justified it in entering judgment n. o. v., and acted accordingly. We have read the printed notes of testimony, and cannot concur in this disposition of the case. .</p>

Kemble, <a href="/pa/215/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="215 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="948325" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0410-01">215 Pa. 410</a>; Second Nat. Bk. of Pittsburgh v.

O'. v. The court below appears to have been none too certain of its ground when it entered the judgment now attacked, and also to have had the proper practice in mind, for it then said: “We are not passing <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>at present upon the question of a new trial, but are entering this judgment non obstante .veredicto without prejudice to a further application for a new trial in case it should be decided by an appellate court that we are in error.” Under the circumstances at bar, we are of opinion that the court below erred in entering judgment n. o. v., and shall make an order similar to one recently entered, on a like state of facts, in Chambers v. Mesta Machine Co., <a href="/pa/251/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="251 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="1019771" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0618-01">251 Pa. 618</a>, 624.</p>
