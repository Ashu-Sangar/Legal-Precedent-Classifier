    <p class="summary" id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.13",209,[188,1437,1148,533]]]'>The plaintiff in her statement complains that her husband, being a passenger for hire on a train operated by the defendant company, was negligently carried beyond his place of destination and put off the train at an unsafe and dangerous place for passengers to alight; that in consequence thereof, he was compelled to cross railroad tracks in order to reach his proper station and that before he “reached the road,” he was negligently struck by a freight train and received injuries thereby which caused his death the next day.</p>

The train stopped at Bruceton station. His wife, who was at the station to meet him, saw him at the doorway of one of the cars, but he did not get off. Her evidence indicated that the stop was long enough to enable him to get off but she said he did not get off because of the starting of the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>train. There was no evidence as to where he did get off, nor as to the circumstances under which he left the train. Of course, it follows that there was no evidence that he was put off against his consent or protest, at “an unsafe and dangerous place.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-3" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[273,604,1148,1241]]]'>It did not appear that he crossed tracks in order to reach a “road.” On the contrary he seems to have walked back towards Bruceton station, alongside of or on the main track of this railroad company. He was seen walking along a path close to the track, perhaps a mile beyond Bruceton. It was not dark then, but was between five and sis o’clock of an evening in January. Not long after he was so seen, the engineer of a moving freight train saw the body of a man lying in front of his train, five car lengths ahead, with his head on a rail of the main track on which the train was moving and his body between the rail and a siding. The engineer sounded his whistle and put on his emergency brake but was unable to stop his train in time to avoid a collision. The pilot of the engine struck the man and turned his body over several times. This man was the plaintiff’s husband; and the point where he was lying and was struck was somewhere between where he had been seen walking alongside of the track and Bruceton station. It was about 5:45 p. m. There was no evidence that he had been struck by any other engine or train. He was taken to a hospital at Washington, Pennsylvania, where he died shortly after.</p>
