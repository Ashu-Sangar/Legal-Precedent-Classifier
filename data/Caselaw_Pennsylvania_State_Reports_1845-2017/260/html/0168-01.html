It appeared that the trustee had already received compensation in his capacity as sole executor of the estate, which consisted partly of shares of stock of such company, of which the trustee was president, in which capacity he received an annual salary of $12,000 per year; that during the period in question claimant had received the sum of $50,000 for special gervices from the company; that the compensation allowed him as executor, was approximately ten per cent, of the amount distributed; and that in making the sale in question he had profited personally by receiving an enhanced price for the stock individually held by him. <em>Held, </em>the claim for additional compensation was properly refused.</p>

The finances of the company at times were difficult; Mr. Fletcher personally loaned the company $200,000 to tide over its business affairs; at one time during the lean years of business a demand was made for payment within ninety days of $400,000 of indebtedness to one of the banks; two other banking institutions, having confidence in Fletcher’s management, took care of this loan to the extent of $500,000 and gave the management the benefit of its credits.

The cotrustee, who was not executor, offered no testimony in opposition to this special claim but places itself on record at the hearing, and by brief of its counsel, that any allowance of this claim is not a waiver of the cotrustee’s right to compensation on income as accounted for and on corpus when the trust terminates, and the contention raises the question that the claim is barred by the act of assembly and that the facts are not of such an extraordinary and special kind as to warrant a departure from the rule or bring it within any of the exceptions, where, by adjudicated cases, special claims in this double capacity have been allowed.</p>

While it is there indicated that in extraordinary circumstances the corpus of a trust estate may be liable to compensation, .the case has no application to the question at bar, for the reason that it is divorced from the element of a prior executorship where compensation had'been allowed. Thouron’s Est., <a href="/pa/182/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="182 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="893203" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0126-01">182 Pa. 126</a>, is also a case of trusteeship alone, after the estate had been duly administered upon by a different fiduciary. It there appears that the trustee filed a first account in 1882, claiming no compensation; a second in 1891, claiming no <em>compensation; </em>a third in 1892, claiming no compensation, and a fourth, the account in question, in 1896, covering a period of four years since the former account in which, on account of services arising out of special labor in converting unproductive real estate and thus increasing the capital, a request for some compensation was allowed. While the court comments upon the special services rendered and affirms the allowance made, it must be observed that the Act of 1864 was not in question, and that whatever allowance was made on account of compensation necessarily was credited against the final charge when the trust terminated. It is manifest, therefore, that the case in its facts and in its conclusions is not authority for an exception under the Act of 1864. So also in Penn-Gaskell’s Est., No. 1, <a href="/pa/208/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="208 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="998066,998132" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0342-01,/pa/208/0342-02">208 Pa. 342</a>, there was no double capacity of executor and trusteeship; the simple question was whether a commission should be allowed a trustee presently in the sale of real estate under the Price Act, authorized by the court, the opinion stat<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>ing: “The rule, therefore, is that commissions on the principal of a trust estate will not be allowed except where the fund is in course of distribution. While this rule is one of general application, it is not a fixed and unvarying one, and will be departed from, as in Thouron’s Est., <a href="/pa/182/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="182 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="893203" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0126-01">182 Pa. 126</a>, where the circumstances are unusual, the trust of long duration, and when the fund has been largely increased by the skillful management of the trustee. The rule, however, is such a salutary one that it should be departed from only in exceptional cases.” In Davidson’s Est. (No. 2), <a href="/pa/204/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="204 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="927442" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0381-01">204 Pa. 381</a>, again not applicable as to the facts so far as the double office is concerned, yet clearly applicable on principle, it is distinctly decided that an executor is not entitled to commission on enhanced value of stocks and other investments made with money on which commissions had been charged and allowed in a prior account. Harrison’s Est., <a href="/pa/217/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="217 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="953728" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0207-01">217 Pa. 207</a>, also referred to by claimant, merely states the well-recognized doctrine that compensation is based upon services and labor performed and not upon any rate or percentage as a fixed rule,- that the rate or percentage may be a convenient method of arriving at compensation and that a general amount stated for compensation may be preferable to a rate of commission. The decision distinctly refused compensation on capitalized ground rents in the account there filed, indicating clearly that compensation, if allowed at all, must be at the close of the trust; here again, there is no question of a prior executorship in the same person.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[206,1914,1148,482]],["BL_206.1",206,[245,327,1150,1248]]]'>On the other hand, the claimant has authority for his contention in Kerrigan’s Est., 36 Pa. O. 0. 57, where the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia allowed compensation to a trustee who had been executor, by reason of the special circumstances and his particular skill in effecting an advantageous sale of the trust stock. The facts were that the decedent was a member of a firm carrying on an industrial business; after his death a limited partnership was, formed which took over the business; the trustee re<a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>ceived for the purposes of the trust three hundred shares of the par value of one hundred dollars in this limited partnership, and he was a manager therein; subsequently what the court states was the “psychological moment,” he prudently sold this stock at two hundred dollars per share, increasing the principal thirty thousand dollars, claimed and was allowed compensation of five per cent, on the amount. It will be observed that while the trustee was a manager in the limited partnership there is nothing to indicate that he was otherwise interested therein or that he received compensation in any executive office in the partnership, two factors which have a most important bearing upon the contention here. For, it must be remembered that Mr. Fletcher was not only president of the Riter-Conley Company at the salary of $12,000 per year and therefore vitally interested in the business success of the concern under his management, but that he was the owner of two thousand shares of its capital stock, one-fifth of the whole, and that therefore what he did, and in this case most efficiently did, was largely his duty as the president of the company, and was necessarily influenced by the preservation of his own property to the extent of one-fifth ownership therein.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[243,1587,1149,701]]]'>When the allowance of $240,000 was made to him upon the filing and audit of his executor’s account it was recognized that this very large compensation far exceeded, was almost double in fact, the maximum compensation allowed to executors, based upon five per cent, of all the assets received by them, to wit: $3,649,297.62. Irrespective of the fact that the widow and son, the life tenants, made no objection to this large charge, it could not have been permitted in view of the fact that the ultimate remaindermen of this estate are unknown and were not represented, had this act of assembly not been in mind, which barred him from claiming compensation hereafter as trustee upon the corpus of the trust estate.</p>
