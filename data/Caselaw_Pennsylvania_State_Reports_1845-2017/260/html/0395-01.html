She was at the time of the making of the will and at the time of her mothers death neither married nor contemplating marriage with any particular person. There was no limitation-, over.

Each of the quarterly payments was to be made to the son personally and upon his sole receipt therefor, and after his death to transfer and pay over the principal and accumulated interest as the son might by will appoint, and in default of appointment to pay the principal to such persons and for such uses as they would be entitled to had testator died intestate seized and possessed of his property.</p>

This argument works both ways. It may be said that as to the sum to be paid over direct to the son, that is freed of trust, and it may be admitted that if the interest in the firm is bought the trust terminates, but the very fact that testator so provided would negative the thought and purpose that the trust could be ended in any other way, or, what is more improbable, that no trust exists at all.</p>
