Tbe witness testified that tbe quantities of whiskey contained in tbe barrels alleged to have been delivered would be determined by tbe United States gaugers, who gave tbe figures to one-of tbe plaintiff’s clerks, who is now dead, and that this clerk then entered them in bis book, and bills were made out for tbe same. No evidence was produced by tbe defendant to contradict tbe testimony produced by tbe plaintiff’s witnesses. Tbe plaintiff’s testimony consisted largely of oral testimony; tbe evidence, for instance, of Haig, that certain books were original order books; that tbe bandwriting of varidus parties since dead was the bandwriting of said parties; that tbe United States gaugers determined bow much, whiskey was in a barrel, and gave tbe figures for tbe same to tbe clerk, who entered them in tbe books.</p>
