In her answer the respondent, Mrs. Bower, admits the material facts averred in the bill, but asserts her right notwithstanding, under the will of testatrix, her sister Amelia to whom was given a life interest in the mortgages having died, to the whole and exclusive enjoyment of the real estate in fee simple of which testatrix had died seized. There was entire agreement as to facts, and the question dividing the parties was resolved into a pure question of law arising out of the construction of the will of Matilda Miller. The lower court upon a review of the case reached the conclusion that the testatrix by her will of April 25,1894, intended to and did dispose of her entire estate; that by use of the words “mortgages, money and personal property,” in connection with the other language contained in the will, she intended to pass title of property of any nature or kind whatever which she owned or in which she had an interest at the time of her death; that there was no intestacy, but that the real estate of which Matilda Miller was seized at the time of her death passed to the defendant and her two children, subject to the estate therein of the sister Amelia now deceased. From the decree so mitered we have this appeal.</p>

The single question it presents is, what was testatrix’s intention with respect to this after acquired land of which she died seized, as expressed in her will? If no intention with respect to its disposition can be gathered therefrom then it necessarily results that as to it she died intestate, and such property descended to her heirs at law including these appellants who would then have standing to demand partition of the property. It is absolutely necessary in order that the will may be construed as operating upon subsequently acquired real estate that an intent on part of the testatrix that it should so operate shall affirmatively appear in the will itself. To hold otherwise would be to give to the will, in itself considered, operative elements which were not in it before; and when parol evidence is introduced to make appear an intent, not expressed, the value of such parol evidence is just what it would be in an effort to convey real estate by the same method.</p>

Philadelphia, <a href="/rawle/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="4 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1823526" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0323-01">4 Rawle 323</a>. The Act of April 8,1833, P. L. 250, followed close upon this decision. By the tenth section of this act it is provided — “That the real estate acquired by a testator after making his will, shall pass by a general devise, unless a contrary intention be manifest on the face of the will.” To this day that remains the law, though it may now receive a wider application than was foreseen as likely to result. .One effect of it is to give the words “general devise” when they occur in a will, the import and significance of an express intent on the part of the testator to' dispose of after acquired real estate. By “general devise” is to be understood a testamentary disposition of real estate without qualification as to tenure.. Evidently the applicability of the act in any given case. depends on <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>whether the will under consideration contains a general devise of land. If it does, and no contrary intent appears after acquired real estate is included in the devise. Applying this test to the will of the testatrix, does it contain any general devise of land? Strictly speaking it contains no devise at all, for the word devise correctly used applies only when land is the subject of the testamentary disposition; but it has a -popular meaning which includes every species of property, and this wider meaning is allowed when it is made clear that it was in that sense the testator employed it. The will in question was written by the testatrix herself and bears sufficient evidence that the writer was uninformed as to the distinction the law makes between the words devise and bequeath. The law allows it to be only fair in such case to reject the construction that would, for no- other reason than the use of technically inexact words, restrict the testamentary disposition to less than was intended. Passing this point, however, and assuming that by the word bequeath where it occurs in the will the testatrix meant devise — and there is much in the circumstance attending the making of the will and the will itself to support this view — is any general devise within the meaning of the act to be found in the testatrix’s will. It is unquestionably true that confining the operation of this will to the purely personal estate with which it exclusively deals, it is absolutely free from any ambiguity, and admittedly disposes of all the estate the testatrix then owned. What justifying pretext can there be under such conditions for deriving from it an implied intention to dispose thereby of subsequently acquired real estate? A case very much in point though arising in an altogether different proceeding is the appeal of Price et al., <a href="/pa/169/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="169 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="870721" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0294-01">169 Pa. 294</a>. We quote from the opinion as delivered by McCollum, J., p. 300 — “We think the writing to which this contention relates does not comprehend the disposition of the after' acquired real estate and that, as before stated, the directions in it refer exclusively to the dis<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>tribution or division of <em>the </em>writer’s personal effects. The presumption that he did not intend to die intestate as to any portion of his property cannot prevail against the clear import of the paper he prepared as expressive of his purpose regarding the disposition at his death of the effects he might leave. We discover nothing in it which deprives his only heir of her rights under the intestate laws in the real estate of which he died seized.” It only remains to point out a feature in the case of Jacobs’ Est., <a href="/pa/140/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="140 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="972556" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0268-01">140 Pa. 268</a>, a case much relied upon by the appellee, which distinguishes it from the present one. In that case there were two funds for distribution, one arising out of the sale of personalty and one from the sale of after acquired realty. The testator’s will, after giving several pecuniary legacies and one or more specific, disposed of the residue of the estate in the following manner — “The remainder and residue of my money I give and bequeath to the Hospital of the Protestant Church in Philadelphia.” The will was silent as to any real estate, for the reason as stated in the opinion, that when the will was executed testatrix owned none; what she had at the time of her death had been acquired subsequent to the date of the will. The heirs claimed the fund arising from the sale of the real estate upon the ground that as to it testatrix had died intestate. The court held that the word “money” as there used by the testatrix in the residuary clause of the will was the equivalent of the word “property”; and that the testatrix employed it as indicating property of every description. Under this construction it may be that the residuary gift there was the equivalent of a “general devise” which, as we have seen, would meet all the requirements as to evidence of the intention to devise subsequently acquired land; but this case does not so decide, nor do we know of any that does. The case is inapplicable here be'cause of the fact that there the court derived from the language of the will'an intent to dispose of after acquired realty, while <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>here it is impossible to reach a like conclusion regard being had solely to the written will.</p>
