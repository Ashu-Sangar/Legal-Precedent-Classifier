The lessee constructed such furnaces together with other necessary equipment, all resting upon a cast iron floor, supported by steel framework laid on concrete foundations. The supports, in addition to being a necessary part of the furnaces, constituted a part of the steel building, entirely enclosing the furnaces and equipment. The trial judge charged the jury that if the defendant erected the building for experimental purposes in connection with its business and with the intention of taking it away at the expiration of the lease, defendant would not be liable for damages on account of its removal.

The lessor was fully informed of lessee’s intention to use the premises for the purpose of constructing thereon an experimental plant for the manufacture of benzine and gasoline by what was known as the Rittman process, the secret of which had been offered by the United States government to manufacturers agreeing to construct plants for the demonstration and use of the method. The use of this process required the installation of furnaces of a particular type. The first furnace was purely experimental and was constructed in the main building on the premises at the time lessee took possession. Six additional furnaces were subsequently constructed by defendant on an unused portion of the property. These furnaces were made up of large tubes surrounded by the furnace proper, which was of steel and fire brick construction. In connection with the furnaces were necessary pumps, motors and other driving mechanisms, pipes, valves, condensers, safety appliances, etc., all resting upon a cast-iron floor, in turn supported by steel framework, laid on concrete foundations. Also upon the premises was an overhead crane used in connection with the furnaces. All mentioned attachments and mechanical contrivances were necessary to the operation of the furnaces and required rigid supports of fireproof construction to eliminate vibration and guard against fire.. In addition to being <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>a necessary part of the furnaces, the supports constituted a part of the steel building enclosing them. The building, 52 x 180 feet, built entirely of steel and iron Was open along the sides below the eaves to^ provide ventilation. The trial judge charged, inter alia, that if defendant erected the building for experimental purposes in connection with its business and with the intention of taking it away at the expiration of the leáse, defendant would not be liable for damages on account of its removal. He also left to them to determine if the furnaces and the building were so interwoven as a whole structure to constitute one plant for the purpose of defendant’s business. Plaintiff contends the question submitted was one of law to be determined by a construction of the lease, and, under its provisions, no right existed in defendant to remove either the furnaces or the building. We are inclined to agree with plaintiff’s view of the matter, so far as to hold the question of right of removal is governed by the express provisions of the lease and accordingly is a question of law. We cannot, however, concur in the conclusion that defendant was thereby precluded from removing the furnaces and building in which they were constructed. The lease forbids the removal by lessee of additions or improvements made by lessor — and this clause is significant and aids in the construction — and gives lessee the right to remove “all machinery and apparatus and other things of that character installed by it during the term.” A general rule is that in case of doubt or uncertainty as to the meaning of language used in a lease, its provisions will be construed most strongly against the lessor and in favor of the lessee: Kaufmann v. Liggett, <a href="/pa/209/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="209 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="936246" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0087-01">209 Pa. 87</a>; Lindsay Bros. Inc. v.

The following language in Isman v. Hanscom, <a href="/pa/217/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="217 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="953602" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0133-01">217 Pa. 133</a>, 135, is particularly applicable here: “The important and controlling question in this case arises out of the construction of the lease between the parties. The question of trade or tenant fixtures does not enter into the case, and hence need not be considered. The lease, which is the contract between the parties, determines the ownership of the property in question, and hence the rights of the parties thereto depend entirely upon the proper interpretation of the instrument. If the lease had been silent as to the ownership of the various items of property in dispute, then it would have been necessary to determine whether the property was trade fixtures, and, if so, to whom it belonged, to the landlord or the tenant. When, however, a landlord and tenant stipulate in their lease as to the ownership of chattels which may be placed upon the demised premises by the tenant, the stipulation will be in force regardless of what might be the rights of the parties at common law. ' In such cases, the contract is the <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>law made by the parties themselves, and that must determine their rights.”</p>
    <p id="b229-3" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[206,450,1158,1959]],["BL_230.1",230,[267,359,1146,918]]]'>Application to this case of the general rules relating to the construction of leases, heretofore mentioned, warrants the conclusion that property placed upon the premises by the tenant in the way of fixtures necessary to the proper operation of the furnaces, which the parties contemplated might be installed by the lessee, would come within the designation “apparatus and other things of that character.” The process in question being in an experimental stage probably neither of the parties was aware of the exact machinery and apparatus the plant would require or precisely what devices would be necessary for setting it up. To construct the plant the building of the furnaces was necessary and to these, in turn, defendant was obliged to connect the various apparatus and appliances to enable the whole to- be used for the purposes intended. This required the construction of framework to carry pipes and support the furnaces, overhead cranes and other mechanical devices used in connection with the scheme. Over all the apparatus, a covering or housing was required to protect both the equipment and workmen from the Aveather. In 3 Corpus Juris, 252, the word “apparatus” is defined “A generic word of the most comprehensive signification; implements ; an equipment of things provided and adapted as a means to some end; any complex instrument or appliance for a specific action or operation, of which mechanical or chemical instruments are given as examples; a full collection or set of implements for a given duty, experimental or operative; things provided to some end, especially a full collection or set of implements or utensils for performing scientific experiments or operations.”Many cases are cited to sustain the text. Where, as in the present case, the framework of a building erected contemporaneously Avith the mechanical apparatus and appliances is an essential part of the scheme itself and necessary to its operation, we see no valid reason for <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>holding the mere act of partly enclosing the sides of the framework and covering the whole with a roof should have the effect of so changing its character as to make it distinct from the contents enclosed. We are not required, however, to decide that the building in this case is within the meaning of the single word “apparatus” since the parties incorporated in the lease a sentence broader in its scope, to wit: “all things of that character installed by it during the term,” that is of the character of “machinery and apparatus.” Under the admitted facts in the case, and giving lessee the benefit of the doubt as required, the latter was within its legal rights under the lease in removing the furnaces and the building necessary for their proper protection and operation constructed by it. Plaintiff accordingly has no just ground for complaint that the trial judge left the question for the determination of the jury.</p>

Mattes, <a href="/pa/253/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="253 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1024092" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0101-01">253 Pa. 101</a>; Hopkins v. Tate, <a href="/pa/255/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="255 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1027705" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0056-01">255 Pa. 56</a>.</p>
