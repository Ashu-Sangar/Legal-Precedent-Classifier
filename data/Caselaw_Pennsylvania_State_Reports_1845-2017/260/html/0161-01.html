Deceased was not, during this time, under the care of a physician and the attention required was not nursing in the ordinary sense of the word, but bandaging, bathing and dressing made necessary by the diseases with which he was afflicted. Plaintiff claimed the services were performed under a promise by deceased to compensate her by a legacy in his will and offered proof in support of her contention consisting mainly of declarations by decedent to that effect. Plaintiff referred to deceased as “grandpap” although no relationship existed between them. The trial judge submitted to the jury to ascertain whether services were rendered under an agreement as alleged, and, if so, to fix their reasonable value, limiting recovery to a period subsequent' to March 1, 1906, because of a receipt offered in evidence of that date purporting to be a full and final settlement between the parties to that time.

And I, the said Kate Flaccus hereby acknowledge to have received this day from William Mazet the sum of one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00/100) in full payment for all room rent owing to me by him up to March 1, 1906, and $10.00 in full washing to Mch. 1, 1906.

The correctness of the action of the trial judge in submitting this question to the jury is not raised in this appeal. He further held as to services rendered earlier <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>than March 1,1906, the evidence was insufficient to overcome the effect of the receipt; in this conclusion we concur. Memoranda on the margin of the receipt acknowledges payment by plaintiff of various specific items including a note, mortgage, interest, plumbing bill and cash amounting in all to $1,169.54. On the other hand, plaintiff acknowledges receipt from deceased of room rent to date, an item for washing and a fee for satisfaction of a mortgage. In absence of further provisions it might well be argued the effect of a mutual paper signed by both parties should be confined to the items specifically mentioned. We have, however, additional words to the effect that the receipt was “a full and final settlement between us up to March 1st, 1906, the said Wm. Mazet on March 1st, 1906, owing the said Kate Flaccus nothing and the said Kate Flaccus on March 1st, 1906, owing to the said Wm. Mazet a $1,200 mortgage with interest thereon from December 14th, 1905,” indicating the parties had in mind a general settlement of all accounts, and that so far as earlier transactions were concerned neither was indebted to the other, with the single exception mentioned. While plaintiff calls attention to the fact of there being no item for the specific services for which claim is here presented, the words used expressly negative the existence of such claim. We do not overlook the rule that words used in a release should not be construed to extend beyond the express consideration mentioned or to operate as a release of indebtedness the parties apparently did not intend: Rapp v. Rapp, <a href="/pa/6/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="6 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="954547" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0045-01">6 Pa. 45</a>; Codding v. Wood, <a href="/pa/112/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="112 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="546706" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0371-01">112 Pa. 371</a>; this, however, is a rule of construction and can have no application, where, as in the present case, the very language used by the parties excludes its use. We have here a written admission signed by plaintiff acknowledging decedent owed her nothing at that date. The only evidence presented by her for the purpose of overcoming the effect of the receipt, consists of proof of declarations made by decedent following the date of the receipt to the effect that plain<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>tiff would be compensated in his will. These declarations may apply to the period succeeding the receipt as well as before and are not necessarily inconsistent with a view that the receipt was in full settlement of all accounts to that date. The evidence in its entirety is not sufficient under the rule discussed to sustain a finding for plaintiff for services preceding March 1, 1906, contrary to plaintiff’s written admission in the receipt.</p>
