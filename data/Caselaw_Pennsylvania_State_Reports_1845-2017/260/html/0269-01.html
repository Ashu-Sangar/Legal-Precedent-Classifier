A testator who was unmarried and without issue bequeathed the income on $9,000 for the care and maintenance of certain family lots, three-fourths of the income of the residue, which residue approximated $36,000, for similar purposes and for the beautifying of a cemetery, including the upkeep of the chapel, and tbe surplus towards a fund for erecting a new chapel to replace the old one, one-fourth of the income of the residue for the care of a lot in, and for beautifying and keeping in repair a certain other cemetery. Testator further directed that if the trustees of the cemetery should refuse to allow the income to be so used or if any of the legacies should fail or become void, the funds or income or any surplus income should pass to a named home for poor children. The home for poor children contended that sufficient of the corpus should be set aside to make effective the testator’s desires and that all excess principal or income should be awarded to it. <em>Held, </em>the Orphans’ Court properly refused the claim without prejudice to the right of said home to make a further application, if it could at any time show that all of the income was not required for the upkeep of the cemetery and burial lots.</p>

This is a right assured to him by law, and restrained only by those enactments and principles of public policy, which, for the good order and welfare of society, have been established by the legislation or by courts. Gifts for the erection of monuments and construction of vaults or tombs in cemetery lots, and inclosing the same, and providing for their future care and adornment, together with other similar mortuary gifts, have ever been recognized, and the wishes of the donor or testator carried out by the courts. And, to remove all doubt upon the subject, the legislature by the Act of May 26,1891, P. L. 119, expressly declared that no disposition of property hereafter made for the maintenance or care of any cemetery, church yard, etc., or monument or other erections on or about the same, shall Tail by reason of such disposition having been made in perpetuity but shall be held to be made for charitable use.’ Nor are we aware it has ever been suggested that, in the absence of any express statute, the courts will regulate the amount the testator may direct to be thus expended.
