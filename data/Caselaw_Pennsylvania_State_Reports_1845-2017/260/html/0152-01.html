The plaintiffs and defendant were the sisters of decedent and comprised all of the parties entitled to distribution of his estate. It was admitted by contestant in the Orphans’ Court that all of the paper writing in controversy was in the handwriting of,decedent with the exception of the words “For Ev and Anna,” and contestant also denied that decedent intended the writing to take effect as his last will and testament. The precept directed the trial of two questions: “First, Whether or not the words ‘For Ev and Anna,’ now appearing in the paper writing dated August 10,1914, offered for probate as the last will and testament of P. McGrory, deceased, are in said decedent’s handwriting; and Second, Whether or not the said P.

McGrory, the testator, died on October 15,1915, unmarried, at the age of 34 years. He was a locomotive engineer, and lived in East Carnegie, Allegheny County, with two of his sisters, Evolen McGrory (commonly known as Ev), and Anna H. McGrory, for whom he had furnished a home for several years prior to his death. The remaining sister, Sadie Fisher, contestant, had married, and for at least eight years prior to the death of P. <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>McGrory had lived with her husband in Borough of Sheraden, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.</p>

McGrory and his two sisters, Evolen and Anna. It was customary for decedent to take his train out in the morning and return to his home about 12 o’clock; when he would continue at home until 1:30 in the afternoon. On August 10, 1911, decedent sat down in his dining room after lunch in the presence of his sisters, Ev and Anna McGrory, and wrote the paper which was offered in this case as his will. The paper which he used had been procured by him from a real estate office. He said that he was going to make his will, and after writing it out and signing it, explained to his sisters concerning the property which he had listed upon the paper and told them that the paper was Ms will, and that if anything happened to him that was for his sisters, Anna and Evolen. It did not appear what was done with the paper by testator after executing the same until September 11,1915, when he showed it to his physician, Dr. James A. Hamma, who was attending him at that time for the disease which resulted in his death a month later. The paper was found on November 1, 1915, after decedent’s death, in the inside pocket of a pass book or pocket book in his working coat pocket, placed in this pass book directly back of the railroad pass which he invariably carried with him. It was then taken by Anna McGrory who had found it, to Dr. James A. Hamma, and after showing it to him she delivered it to Harry Reingrover, a real estate man, who had charge of the collection of the rents from the decedent’s real estate and by him it was taken to the office of James R. Bell, Esq., and offered for probate.</p>

The time at which the erasure was made, was clearly a question of fact for the jury, and the trial judge properly instructed them that, if they found as a fact that the erasure was made after the time when the paper was written and signed, there was no evidence that the paper, as changed, was ever declared by the decedent to be his will, and no competent evidence that he intended the paper, as it then stood, to be his will.</p>
