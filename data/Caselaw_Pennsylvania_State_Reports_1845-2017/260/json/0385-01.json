French and children.\u201d Certain of the legatees named in Item Sixth died before the termination of the life estates. Held, that the legatees named in Item Sixth took vested, not contingent remainders.\nArgued Jan. 17, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 244, Jan. T., 1917, by Harry B. French and Ida French Graff, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., Oct. T., 1886, No. 596, sustaining exceptions to adjudication, In Estate of Anna Maria Stocker, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion by Gest, J.:\n' The testatrix left her entire residuary estate in trust for her two unmarried sisters, or the survivor of them, and on the death of. the survivor directed .that the estate should \u201cpass and vest in my heirs at law at that.time as named in item sixth of this my will.\u201d By the following paragraph of her will, she directed that all the property that could b,e divided at. the death of her last surviving unmarried sister should be divided by her trustees in certain proportions among certain persons who were specifically named; She then said, \u201cas all my estate cannot be sold or divided at the death of my last unmarried sister, I direct that when it can be divided my executors and trustees will make the same division as above.\u201d During the pendency of the life estate certain of the legatees-died, and the narrow question raised by these exceptions is whether their legacies were vested, in which case they would pass to their personal representatives, or whether they were contingent upon the legatees surviving the life tenants, in which case the legacies, it is claimed, pass under a so-called second residuary clause, in words following: \u201cI leave the daughters of my sister, Caroline S. Elbert, the half of my residuary estate and Harry B. French and children the other half.\u201d\nIt is quite obvious that when the testatrix at the end of the fifth clause referred to her heirs at law as named in item sixth of her will, she did not use the words in their technical sense, for the persons named were not her heirs at law. Some of her heirs were not mentioned, qnd some of the persons named were riot her heirs at law at all. What she meant by \u201cheirs\u201d was the legatees whom she designated by name. \u201cHeirs\u201d in a will, especially a will written as was this inops consillii is often used in its popular sense to include legatees or devisees who are made heirs by the will: Hoff\u2019s App., 28 Pa. 51; Widmeyer\u2019s Est., 45 Pitts. L. J. 208. The word was used in this sense also in the eighth item of this will. The meaning is, of course, a question of intention. Porter\u2019s App., 45 Pa. 201, and in this case there can be no doubt that the testatrix referred to the particular designated legatees.\nIn the next paragraph of her will the testatrix directs the distribution of all her estate that can be divided at the death of her last surviving sister, evidently having in mind what indeed proved to be the fact, that part of her estate was represented by an interest in a large tract of l\u00e1nd' in the southern part of the city not sold until recently, and she then further directed that, when her estate could be divided the division was to be the same as above. , , , .\nWe are of opinion that the remainders given to the legatees named in item sixth were vested and not contingent upon their surviving Emily H. Stocker, who died on June 18, 1913. The gift to the legatees was one that would necessarily take effect in possession upon the termination of the preceding life estates and subject to no other conditions save that termination so far as the express words of the will afford an indication of the testamentary purpose. There is no gift to a class, for the legatees are named individually with the proportions exactly stated in which they are to share the estate, and there is an. entire absence of any words expressive of survivorship or the like.\nThat there is a strong presumption of law in favor of a vested estate is indeed admitted by the auditing judge, and Bair\u2019s Est., 255 Pa. 169, cited in the adjudication, is a recent illustration of it. The argument in favor of the contingency turns on the phraseology that the estate shall \u201cpass and vest in my heirs at law at that time,\u201d i. e., the death of the life tenants, and the direction in the sixth item that the property shall be \u201cdivided and distributed.\u201d But the will does not say \u201cshall pass and vest at that time to my heirs at law,\u201d the words on which such stress is laid do not immediately follow and thus qualify the word \u201cvest,\u201d or indicate that the period of vesting should be postponed or be subject to a contingency. The normal sense of the word \u201cvest\u201d indeed is to indicate a present and immediate interest as distinguished from one that is contingent. McClellan\u2019s Est., 221 Pa. 261, where Judge Ashman, whose opinion was adopted by the Supreme Court, said by way of illustration \u201can estate in remainder is vested in the r\u00e9maindermen, although its enjoyment is deferred until the falling-in of the life estate. Certainly in a will such as the present, it would be dangerous to hold that even if the testatrix had said \u201cvest at that time,\u201d she meant that.no interest should pass but remain contingent until that time. This would impale her intent on a sharp point of law, for what, she most probably meant by vest was to vest in actual use or possession: Phillip\u2019s Est., No. 1, 205 Pa. 504.\nWe do not discover any intent in the use of the words \u201cto be given and distributed,\u201d that the gift is only implied from the direction to pay, as in Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, cited by the auditing judge, where the direction was to pay to the legatees \u201cas soon as he arrives at twenty-one years of age.\u201d In Rosengarten v. Ashton, 228 Pa. 389; Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, was cited, but the court expressly stated that no rule as to vested and contingent remainders was especially called for in construing the will and decided the case on the clear ground that there was a substitutionary gift to the issue if a deceased grandchild of the share the parent would have taken if living, thus showing the intent of the testator, that a grandchild should only take if living at the death of the last child of the testator. Mulliken v. Earnshaw, 209 Pa. 226, was a similar case, and totally unlike the present. In the recent case of Rau\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 464, in which Rosengarten v. Ashton, 228 Pa. 389, was distinguished, the court stated the general rule to be that an interest is to be construed as contingent only where it is impossible to construe it as vested, and said, \u201cThe whole policy of the law inclines to the vesting of legacies and allows that policy to yield only where a contrary purpose is expressed in the will.\u201d\n\u25a0 It was urged at the argument that the very object of the so-called second residuary clause was to-dispose of any lapsed legacies in the first residuary clause. We cannot persuade ourselves that this was the intention of the testatrix; that this is extremely unlikely appears from the fact that the legatees mentioned in the second residuary clause were also included among the legatees in the first. The\u2019intention to give lapsed legacies to-the very persons whose death or the death of some of whom might occasion -the lapse\"; would be too' extraordinary to -attribute to any one: ' The cases a're'not infrequent where a testator has employed two residuary clauses, whether from carelessness or stupidity, or some undiscoverable reason, but we are not bound to find a meaning for that which is insensible, or what is worse, strain the will in order to create an intestacy so that the second residuary clause may have something to operate on.\nIn the view we take of this case, it is not necessary to consider the questions raised by the other exceptions.\nThe exceptions filed by Laurette de T. Elbert et al., and those filed by Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, etc., trustees under the will of Anthony E. Stocker, are sustained; the other exceptions are dis-. missed. The balance for distribution is awarded to and among the legatees named in the sixth item of the will, or the legal representatives of such as are deceased, subject to the assignments and agreements recited in the adjudication.\nAnderson, J., dissents.\nThe court sustained the exceptions. Harry B. French and Ida French Graft appealed.\nErrors assigned were in sustaining the exceptions.\nDavid Jay Myers, with him William Henry Kern and Alfred T. Steinmets, for appellants.\nHampton L. Carson, with him Francis A. Lewis, 8d, Joseph Carson, Duane, Morris & Heckscher and Prichard, Saul, Bayard <& Evans, for appellees.\nFebruary 25, 1918:"
