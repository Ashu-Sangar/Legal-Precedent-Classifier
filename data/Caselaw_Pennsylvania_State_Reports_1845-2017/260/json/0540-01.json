Nilson Rantoul Co., Inc., and C. W. Rantoul Co., Inc.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Stewart, Moschzisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nSheriff\u2019s interpl\u00e9ader.\nThe facts appear from the following opinion by Hause, J.:\nOn April 27, 1917, defendants recovered judgments against Marley Mills Corporation, in C. P. No. 2, Philadelphia County, aggregating $6,742.45. On these judgments, testatum fi. fas. issued, on May 3, 1917, to the sheriff of this county and levies were made upon personal property in possession of Marley Mills Corporation at its \u201cBeaver Dam\u201d plant. This property consisted of manufactured paper of the value of $14,065\u2014 and raw materials for the manufacture of paper valued at $8,389.10 and all of it was claimed by the present plaintiff \u2014 Enterprise Wall Paper Company. The usual interpleader issue having been directed, upon trial we instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff for the property in controversy except a small quantity of clay worth $40 \u2014 to which, it was conceded, plaintiff had no title and for which the jury rendered a verdict for defendants. The value of the property in controversy is fixed by the sheriff\u2019s appraisement. Defendants\u2019 point for binding instructions having been refused, they now move for judgment, on the whole record, notwithstanding the verdict. The facts are undisputed. \u2022\nMarley Mills Corporation manufactures paper which is used exclusively for printing wall paper and has a plant at Beaver Dam, in this county. For some time prior to June 1, 1916, the corporation was financially embarrassed and aid was furnished it by the Enterprise Wall Paper Company, a company engaged in printing and selling wall paper with its place of business in Philadelphia. On May 13, 1916, the Marley company and the wall paper company entered into a written contract to be effective for one year from June 1, 1916. By its terms, the parties, in substance, stipulated as follows : The Marley company agreed \u201cto sell and deliver to the Enterprise company the total output of its paper mill at Beaver Dam, Penna.......for the price or sum of $2.40 per hundredweight, terms net f. o. b. mill\u201d and the Enterprise company agreed \u201cto buy and pay for, at said rate, the output of said mill. All materials necessary for the manufacture of paper were to be ordered by the Marley company, billed to the Enterprise company and the latter company undertook \u201cto pay for such raw materials\u201d and the payments were to be \u201ccredited to the account of the Enterprise company against the deliveries of paper\u201d made to At by the Marley company. If raw materials advanced in price from time to time during the year beyond the prevailing cost when the contract was made, the Enterprise company was to pay the advance but should have no credit therefor and if such materials declined in price, the Enterprise company was entitled to the benefit of the decline. \u201cThe wages for labor in the production of paper\u201d at the mill were to be paid with money, to be furnished by the Enterprise company upon receipt by it of \u201ccertified pay rolls\u201d from the Marley company and the latter bound itself not to \u201csell or agree to sell any part of its product to any other person or persons, firm or corporation, without the written consent\u201d of the former. Moneys advanced or loaned to the Marley company by the Enterprise company prior to the date of the contract were to be credited against the \u201cdeliveries\u201d of paper. The concluding two paragraphs of the contract are as follows: \u201cIt is further understood and agreed that all raw materials purchased by the Enterprise company under the terms of this agreement shall be and remain the property of the Enterprise company\u201d and \u201cAt the end of the term of this agreement, an account shall be had between the parties hereto and any balance due or owing by one to the other shall be immediately paid and discharged.\u201d The parties were operating under this contract at the date of the sheriff\u2019s levy which was made prior to the expiration of the year.\nAs against these execution creditors \u2014 defendants\u2014 can it be successfully contended that title to the manufactured paper is in the Enterprise company? If this question be resolved in the negative, we need not consider the status of the raw material.\nA careful consideration of the written contract leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the manufactured product of the mill is the property of the Marley company and is subject to its creditors\u2019 execution process. The initial sentence of the contract is meaningless, even as between the parties, if title to the manufactured product is not in that company. How can the company agree to \u201csell and deliver\u201d what it proposes to make if it have no title thereto when the process of manufacture is complete? And why should the present claimant agree to \u201cbuy and pay for,\u201d at a stipulated rate, that which it already owns? When the claimant contracted to \u201cbuy and pay\u201d for paper, it undertook to acquire, for itself, the title to a product that belonged to some one else not its own property. The Marley company agreed that it would not, during the term of the contract, \u201csell or agree to sell any part of its product\u201d to any other person without the written consent of the claimant. Why should the claimant insist on this stipulation if the product was its property as soon as manufactured? Suppose the Marley company, in violation of its engagement, sold a portion or even all of its finished product to a third person who purchased in good faith, is there a doubt but that a perfect title would pass to the purchaser? And in event of a refusal by the Marley company to deliver the product to the claimant, as rapidly as it was manufactured, would an action of replevin lie to obtain possession? Clearly, no title to the paper vested in the Enterprise company, under the contract, immediately upon its manufacture: Strong, Deemer & Co. v. Dinniny, 175 Pa. 586. The Marley company obligated itself not only to sell but also to \u201cdeliver\u201d its entire output and the delivery, required by the contract, in order to vest title in the Enterprise company, was to be a delivery on some means of transportation at the mill without expense to the purchaser. Suppose a fire had destroyed the paper in question while it was in the plant and before any delivery was made or attempted, could it be seriously argued that the loss must be borne by the Enterprise company? Pee v. Emporium Lumber Co., 50 Pa. Superior Ct. 557. The purpose of the parties, as expressed in their contract, is so apparent as to exclude all question as to what they intended and what they sought to accomplish. The Enterprise company wanted paper. The Marley company was without raw material and funds and these the Enterprise company obligated itself to furnish in advance and it also agreed to buy the entire output of the plant at a stipulated price. The Marley company obligated itself to operate its plant, sell and deliver its entire output to the Enterprise company and credit it, on account of the purchase-price, with the moneys expended by it in the purchase of raw materials and moneys advanced for payment of pay rolls and finally \u201cat the end of the term of the agreement, an ac: count shall be had between the parties and any balance due or owing by one to the other\u201d was to be immediately paid and discharged. This was a pure business transaction between buyer and seller. The title to the paper remained in the Marley company, as respects its creditors at least, until a legal delivery was made to the claimant and such delivery had not been made when the execution process took the paper.\nThe provision in the contract, to the effect that all raw materials purchased by the Enterprise company shall be and remain the property of that company, is significant when it is sought to ascertain even the intention of the parties as to the ownership of the finished product as. between themselves. These materials were ordered in the name of, billed to and paid for by the Enterprise company and, until they actually passed into the process of manufacture, the company sought to retain title. As to the manufactured product, however, when the raw materials could no longer be identified, the contract is silent and, as between the parties, there is no escaping the conclusion that title to the product was in the Marley company and it was this property that the Marley company agreed \u201cto sell and deliver\u201d and the .Enterprise company agreed \u201cto buy and pay for.\u201d\nThen, too, the claimant\u2019s testimony disclosed that in the operation contemplated by the written paper, an accurate account was kept by its bookkeeper in which was charged to the Marley company all moneys advanced, the value of all materials furnished and the like and credit was given for the manufactured product when deliveries were made. This was consistent only with the relation of debtor and creditor in a buying and selling transaction and at the termination of the contract, when an accounting was required and the balance ascertained, could it be seriously doubted that, if the Marley company had not delivered sufficient manufactured paper to cancel the advances made by the claimant, an action of assumpsit would lie?\nThe contract, from beginning to end, to- our minds most conclusively shows' an agreement by one party to manufacture and sell and by the other to- buy. It is clearly executory, (Strong, Deemer & Co. v. Dinniny, 175 Pa. 586), and had the manufacturer made delivery such as the law contemplates and the contract required, (Riggs v. Bair, 213 Pa. 402), the product would have been safe from the assaults of the manufacturer\u2019s creditors.\nEntertaining these views, judgment is now entered in favor of the defendants, notwithstanding the verdict, for the manufactured product in controversy, in addition to the clay of the value of $40, and its value is ascertained to be, under the admitted facts, fourteen thousand and sixty-five dollars ($14,065) making the total judgment fourteen thousand, one hundred and five dollars ($14,-105), and this judgment shall be fully discharged upon payment of the debt, interest and costs due the defendants on their testatum fi. fas. respectively and of the costs of this interpleader issue.\nThe lower court entered judgment for the defendants non obstante veredicto. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in entering judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nBertram D. Bearick, for appellant.\nA. M. Holding, with him Samuel W.
