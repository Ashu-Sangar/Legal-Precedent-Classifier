Justice Moschzlsker,\nThe present suit was brought in trespass to recover for personal injuries; the verdict favored' plaintiff, and judgment was entered accordingly; defendant has appealed. The assignments of error complain, of the charge, the declination of binding instructions and refusal of judgment n. o. v. for defendant, and, lastly, the refusal to grant a new trial. At argument in this court, the appellee moved to quash several of the assignments, thereby raising a nice point of practice, which we shall first discuss and determine.\nSection 2 of the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 279, 280, provides that \u201cexceptions may be taken, without allowance by the trial judge, to any part or all of the charge, or to the answers to points, for any reason that may be alleged regarding the same in the hearing of the court, before the jury retires to consider its verdict, or, thereafter, by leave of the court.\u201d This act is entitled, \u201cAn Act relating to the time and manner of taking exceptions,\u201d etc., and, thereunder, the question is: When the record shows that, although requested so to do by the trial judge, the appellant refused to state reasons for a general exception to the charge, and, upon that ground, no exception was formally noted, will assignments of error complaining of parts of the charge, not specially excepted to, be considered on appeal?\nIt was early decided, under legislation prior to 1911, that one might take a general exception to a charge without at the time particularly specifying the error complained of (Curtis v. Winston, 186 Pa. 492) ; but the relevant statutes then before the court contained no such provision as that just quoted from the Act of 1911, supra. While this latter statute provides that, \u201cupon request of counsel,\u201d exceptions may be noted by the official stenographer, \u201cwithout allowance,\u201d yet, in plain words, it also requires, when an exception is attempted to be taken in that way, reasons therefor shall be given, and that this must be done \u201cin the hearing of the court\u201d; further, that, if a general exception is not taken in the way indicated before the jury retires, thereafter it can be had only \u201cby leave of the court.\u201d\nThe provisions of this recent legislation are both wise and fair; and, as stated in the paper book of counsel for the appellee, \u201cIt is difficult to conceive how hardship is worked on any one by its requirement [that reasons shall be stated when a general exception is taken thereunder]. If the charge is deemed to over-emphasize one side of the case to the injury of the other, all that needs to be stated is that fact. If the charge be deemed misleading, unfair or inadequate, all that needs to be stated is a brief reason to that effect. If there are particular errors of fact or of law, their mere statement complies with the statutory requirement, and may, in many instances, operate to have them immediately corrected, and prevent a mistrial. [If points for charge are simply affirmed or refused, a mere declaration that counsel excepts will suffice]. The requirement seems, therefore, to be eminently reasonable; moreover, entirely apart from its reasonableness, the plain language of the statute leaves no room for doubt as to its intent.\u201d\nIn the taking of a general exception, under the Act of 1911, supra, the statute does not demand minute particularization, but it does require that reasons be given. The words of the statute plainly disclose a purpose, first, to grant a remedy, under which a trial judge cannot arbitrarily prevent the notation of a general exception; and, second, to guard against abuse of the remedy, thus afforded, by compelling counsel to state generally the grounds of their objections. While the language used in the latter connection is not imperative in form, yet, it is clear, a ruling that the requirement in question is not mandatory would defeat the legislative intent that a trial judge shall always, at least in a general way, be informed of the reasons why his instructions are objected to, so that he may make proper corrections. If this were not the purpose of the language employed, then there would be no sense in the express provision for the statement of reasons, therefore that provision can be read properly as a requirement; and, considering the words of the act, as well as the deprivation contained therein of the historic right of a judge to determin\u00e9 every request for an exception, it should be so construed. In fact, the proper maintenance of the long established and just rule that a trial court will not be reviewed on matters in no way called to its attention, unless for basic and fundamental error imperatively calling for reversal, requires that the provision in question be so construed. On a general exception, taken under and in accordance with the requirements of this act, the appellant may assign all errors which, by liberal interpretation, properly can be said either to fall within or be suggested by the reasons stated when taking the exception and, in addition, such controlling fundamental errors of law as above referred to.\nIf, disregarding the- Act of 1911, supra, and. following common law practice, a general exception is asked of the trial judge and, without requiring a statement of reasons, really allowed by him, in several recent cases we have held that, under such circumstances, the appellant \u201cmay assign all actual errors of law and any material matter that is so inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury; moreover, he may assign the whole charge as inadequate, if it fails to present the real questions in the case, or if its general effect is to give a wrong or misleading impression to the jurors concerning the material issues involved or their duties in connection therewith\u201d: Mastel v. Walker, 246 Pa. 65, 71; Foley v. Philadelphia R. T. Co., 240 Pa. 169, 172; Torak v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co., 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 248, 254; see also Geiger v. Maddon, 58 Pa. Superior Ct. 616, 621 (last two opinions by Rice, P. J.). On the other hand, in Watson v. Monongahela River Consolidated Coal & Coke Co., 247 Pa. 469, 477, and Eichenhofer v. Philadelphia, 248 Pa. 365, 373, we ruled that \u201ca mere inadequacy of charge ......cannot be taken advantage of......if not especially excepted to at trial,\u201d and, in Lerch v. Hershey Transit Co., 255 Pa. 190, 195, that courts of appeal will refuse to review \u201cmatters not called to the attention of the trial court, unless the alleged errors are basic and fundamental\u201d; but there is nothing in any of these cases which materially affects the question now before us. Upon the general subject under discussion, see Merritt v. Poli, 236 Pa. 170, 174; Reznor Mfg. Co. v. B. & L. E. R. R. Co., 233 Pa. 369, 372; Reeves v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., 30 Pa. 454, 460; Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v. Brandtmaier, 113 Pa. 610, 619; Person & Riegel Co. v. Lipps, 219 Pa. 99, 112; Peirson v. Duncan, 162 Pa. 187, 193; Wadsworth v. Manufactured Water Co., 256 Pa. 106, 117; Hunter v. Bremer, 256 Pa. 257, 265; Schwartz v. Caplan, 256 Pa. 239, 211.\nIn Foley v. Philadelphia R. T. Co., supra (p. 172), we held that \u201cthe Act of May 11,1911, P. L. 279, has not changed the practice so as to dispense with the necessity for a general exception where appellant desires parts of the charge not especially excepted to reviewed on appeal\u201d; that, \u201ceven under this recent act, counsel is required to request such an exception\u201d; that \u201cit may be taken \u2018without allowance by the trial judge/ but the request must be made \u2018in the hearing of the court\u2019 \u201d; that, \u201cif counsel neglects to get his exception noted at trial, he can only secure it thereafter \u2018by leave of the court\u2019\u201d; and, in Mastel v. Walker, 246 Pa. 65, 71, we held that \u201ca litigant is entitled as a matter of right to except generally to a charge.\u201d In neither of these cases, however, did \u25a0we make any reference to the provision of the Act of 1911, supra, which deals with the manner of taking an exception, for that point was not there involved; and, so far as research discloses, this is the first time any question as to the proper, and requisite, statutory method to be pursued in securing the notation of an effective general exception has been brought before us for determination.\nWe cannot, however, agree with the contention of counsel for appellee that the rule of the court below, that \u201cexceptions to the charge shall be made before the jury retires and shall state explicitly the parts of the charge to which exceptions are taken,\u201d controls here. \u25a0 So far as it fails to coincide with the Act of 1911, supra, the rule can have no effect; and it so fails in two particulars, i. e., (1) in providing that exceptions \u201cshall state explicitly the parts of the charge\u201d objected to, and (2) in requiring that exceptions \u201cshall be made before the jury retires.\u201d As alre\u00e1dy pointed out, when a general exception is entered, under the present statute, explicitness of parts of the charge is not required; and the statute expressly permits exceptions, \u201cby leave of tbe court,\u201d after tbe jury retires. True, in Collins v. Leafey, 23 W. N. C. 264, we expressed approval of a rule of court much like the one now under discussion; but what we there said on that subject was dicta, which subsequently was more than counterbalanced by our decision in Curtis v. Winston, supra.\nThe only assignments properly before us are the third and sixth, which go to the application for judgment n. O', v.; the remainder, for one reason or another, are all defective. Those complaining of the charge are faulty, since they are not supported by either a special or general exception (as already fully discussed); further, because there is no request of record to reduce the charge to writing and have it filed (Curtis v. Winston, supra, p. 496; Foley v. Philadelphia R. T. Co., supra, p. 171); and, lastly, for the reason that, in the complaint of the charge as a whole, it is not quoted ipsissimis verbis (Montalini v. Pa. Co., 256 Pa. 249, 254). The assignment complaining of the refusal to grant a new trial fails to \u201cset forth the motion, the reasons assigned, or the order of the court\u201d: Peoples Nat. Bank of Pensacola v. Hazard, 231 Pa. 552, 554; Fuoss v. Tipton Water Co., 251 Pa. 68, 71. We may add that no reason to convict the court below of manifest error or abuse of discretion in refusing a new trial has been shown.\nIt remains but to consider appellant\u2019s application for judgment n. o. v.; in this connection, it is contended that the case alleged was not proved. The declaration avers that Mary Sikorski, the plaintiff, was injured while a guest in an automobile which, at the time of the accident, was being driven by its owner over the railroad tracks of the defendant corporation, at a regular street crossing; that, at this point, defendant operated safety gates of the lifting type; that, when the machine in question started to cross defendant\u2019s tracks, from the east, these gates were fully raised; that, \u201cas and at the time when the said Mary was with due care in the act of crossing the said railroad......the said automobile in which the said Mary was so riding as aforesaid did then and there, by the negligence of the defendant, as hereinafter described, and without fault on the part of the said Mary, run into and collide with the said gates at the westerly side of the said crossing,......whereby the said Mary was then and there thrown about ivith great violence and was thereby grievously hurt and injured.\u201d Immediately following the averment just quoted, it is alleged \u201cthe said negligence of the defendant whereby the said Mary was hurt ......was then and there as follows, to wit,\u201d after which plaintiff avers, in seven separate paragraphs, that the careless operation of the safety gates, while the automobile in which she was riding was in the act of crossing defendant\u2019s railroad, at the express invitation of the latter, is the negligence, or cause of action, depended upon by her.\nThe testimony produced by plaintiff, if believed and viewed in the light most favorable to her, as the verdict demonstrates it was, shows she occupied a place on the rear seat of the automobile; the driver of the vehicle exercised due care; when he approached the railroad tracks, the gates were down; the car was brought to a standstill for several minutes; the railroad flagman raised the gates and beckoned in such a manner as to indicate that the way was safe, thus inviting the chauffeur to make the crossing; the machine started and, when about half way over the tracks, a locomotive was observed approaching the crossing; at the same moment, the flagman started to lower the gates, which \u201csuddenly\u201d came \u201cdown fast\u201d and were broken by collision with the automobile, before the latter could clear them; in anticipation of this impending collision with the gates, plaintiff \u201cmade an effort to get out,......collapsed and......fell to the ground.\u201d\nWhile the before-quoted introductory part of plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges a state of facts, relating to the collision and the actions of plaintiff at the moment thereof, which may not accord in every particular with the evidence that she produced at the trial, yet there is ample support in the proofs for the material, or controlling, facts as we have just narrated them, and therefrom it is plain to be seen that there is no,material disagreement between the allegata and probata; furthermore, there is no variance whatever between the pleadings and proofs as to the real negligence charged, which was the improper operation of defendant\u2019s gates while the automobile containing plaintiff was being driven across the railroad.\nAppellee very properly contends that, the real cause of action being plainly averred, whether the automobile collided with the gates or the latter with the forme**, is of no particular moment; further,- that the other alleged variance of which defendant seeks to take advantage relates merely to consequential acts following in the wake of the latter\u2019s negligent lowering of its gates, the averment in question being that plaintiff was \u201cthrown about with great violence and thereby grievously hurt\u201d by the actual collision, and the proofs showing that she was in fact \u201cthrown about with great violence and thereby grievously hurt\u201d because she arose from her seat and attempted to guard herself against an impending collision. If this can be called a departure at all, it is an immaterial one, for, had the gates not been carelessly operated after plaintiff was invited and started to cross defendant\u2019s railroad, there would have been no accident, and defendant is accountable for all the consequences naturally following from its original wrongful act; hence, the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury was not the very natural effort which she made to save herself from apparent imminent danger, but the negligent lowering of defendant\u2019s safety gates. The real or proximate reason for plaintiff\u2019s injury having been properly averred as her cause of action, and duly proved at trial, there was no material variance; therefore, the assignments now under discussion are without merit.\nWe find no authority which exactly rules the state of facts now before us, but the following cases, cited by counsel for appellee, tend to support those of his contentions here sustained: Cameron v. Citizens Traction Co., 216 Pa. 191, 193; Cohn v. May, 210 Pa. 615, 617, 618; Palmer v. Warren St. Ry. Co., 206 Pa. 574, 580; Lehner v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 223 Pa. 208, 210; Robel v. P. & R. C. & I. Co., 254 Pa. 342, 345.\nThe assignments of error are either dismissed or overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.",

While in the taking of a general exception to the charge to the jury under the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 279, relating to the taking of exceptions, the statute does not demand minute particularization,'it does require that reasons be given. The words of the statute plainly disclose a purpose, first, to grant a remedy, under which a trial judge cannot arbitrarily prevent the notation of a general exception; and, second, to guard against the abuse of +he remedy, thus afforded, by compelling counsel to state in a general way the grounds of their objections.\n2. Where at the conclusion of the charge to the jury counsel for defendant asked for a general exception to the charge, and declined to state his reasons, although requested so to do by the court, and the court thereupon refused the exceptions, the defendant can not, on appeal, bring before the Supreme Court portions of the charge alleged to be erroneous, but not specially excepted to.\n3. On a general exception, taken under and in accordance with the requirements of the Act of 1911, the appellant may assign all errors which, by liberal interpretation, .properly can be said either to fall within or be suggested by the reasons stated when taking the exception and, in addition, basic and fundamental errors of law.\n4. If, disregarding the Act of 1911, and following the common law practice, a general exception is asked of the trial judge, and, without requiring a statement of reasons, is really allowed by him, the appellant may assign all actual errors of law and any material matter that is so inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury, and may assign the whole charge as inadequate, if it fails to present the real questions in the case, or if its general effect is to give a wrong impression to the jurors concerning the material issues involved or their duties in connection therewith. Courts of appeal will refuse to review matters not called to the attention of the trial court unless the alleged errors are basic and fundamental.\n5. The Act of 1911 has not dispensed with the necessity for a general exception where appellant desires par+s of the charge, not specially excepted to, reviewed on appeal, but counsel must request the exception. It may be taken as a matter of right, without allowance, if in the hearing of the court, but if not noted at the trial can be secured thereafter only by leave of court.\n6. Rule 140 of the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, providing that \u201cexceptions to the charge shall be made before the jury retires and shall state explicitly the parts of the change to which exceptions are taken,\u201d*is in conflict with the Act of 1911 (1) in providing that exceptions shall state explicitly the parts of the charge objected to and (2) in requiring that exceptions shall be made before the jury retires, and is invalid.\n7. Assignments of error complaining of the charge to the jury are defective where no request is made of record to reduce the charge \u2019 to writing and have it filed.\n8. An assignment of error complaining of the charge to the jury as a whole is erroneous where the charge is not quoted ipsissimis verbis.\n9. An assignment of error complaining of the refusal of the court to grant a new trial is defective, where it fails to set forth the motion, the reasons assigned, and the order of the court thereon.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroads \u2014 Automobiles \u2014 Safety gates \u2014 Sudden closing \u2014 Pleading, allegata et probata \u2014 Variance\u2014Immaterial departure.\n10. In an action against a railroad company to recover for injuries sustained by a passenger in an automobile by reason of the safety gates at a grade crossing being suddenly lowered on the automobile, the case is for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiff will be sustained where there was evidence that the gates were so closed after defendant\u2019s flagman had beckoned the driver of the automobile to cross.\n11. Where in such case the statement of claim averred that the automobile collided with the gates and that plaintiff was thrown out, but the proof was that the gate closed down on the automobile, and that plaintiff made an effort to get out, collapsed and fell to the ground and was injured, the alleged variance from the pleadings was immaterial, the real cause of the injury being the negligent closing of the gates.\nArgued Jan. 14, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 174, Jan.

He must bring to the attention of the court any inadequacies .of instruction or alleged errors of law or of fact.\n\u201cThe Court: It would be better, it seems to me, if you were to direct my attention to any inaccuracy that you may have discovered, so that if I have made any mistake \u00cd will have an opportunity to correct it, and, in-that way, present the case to the jury so that, when they have finished their deliberations, the questions will have been decided by them according to the real facts as applied to correct law.\n\u201cMr. Mason: I don\u2019t care to make any specific objections.\n\u201cThe Court: There is an act of assembly which, as I understand it, never having read it, says that counsel is entitled to a general exception upon merely asking for it, and I suppose I will have to obey the act and grant the general exception.\n\u201cMr. Meagher: Your honor won\u2019t decide the question now, I hope. You will note my objection to the granting of a general exception, and we can dispose of it at another time.\n\u201cThe Court: Yes, I think that would be a good plan under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe question as to whether or not a general exception to the charge should be noted was argued subsequently in the court below, and no general exception was allowed to defendant.\nRule 140 of the Common Pleas Courts of Philadelphia County provides: \u201cExceptions to the charge shall be made before the jury retires, and shall state explicitly the parts of the charge to which exceptions are taken.\u201d\nOther facts appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $5,000 and judgment thereon.
