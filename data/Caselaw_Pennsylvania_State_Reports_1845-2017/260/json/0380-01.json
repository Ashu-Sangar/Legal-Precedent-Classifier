The court permitted the opening of the judgment entered on the builder\u2019s bond, and upon a statement of claim and an affidavit of defense being filed, entered judgment for defendants on the point of law raised in the affidavit of defense.\nThe bond in the suit was as follows:\nKnow all men by these presents, that we, Rhoads Shee, principal, and Harry C.
