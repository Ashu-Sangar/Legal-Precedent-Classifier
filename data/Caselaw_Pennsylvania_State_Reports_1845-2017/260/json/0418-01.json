        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nThis is an appeal by plaintiff from judgment of compulsory nonsuit- in an action for personal injuries sustained in a collision of automobiles. We state the facts in accord with plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The west end of Osage avenue intersects Forty-seventh street, Philadelphia. On the evening of January 29, 1917, plaintiff was driving an automobile north in said street and, when about two hundred and fifty feet from such intersection, saw defendant\u2019s coal truck coming rapidly west on Osage avenue, near Forty-sixth street. The lot was vacant and the automobiles, but for the darkness, would have been in sight of each other as they approached the intersection. Between streets plaintiff\u2019s car ran about twelve miles per hour and the defendant\u2019s about twice that speed. There was no light on defendant\u2019s truck and it came to the intersection without warning. Plaintiff was driving on the right hand side of the street and his head lights were burning. When within a distance, variously estimated by him at from twenty to thirty or thirty-five feet, from the south curb of the avenue, he saw defendant\u2019s truck approaching within about six feet of the east curb line of the street and it came rapidly around the southeast corner of the intersection and violently collided with the front of plaintiff\u2019s car, which he had stopped about three feet back of the south curb of the avenue. By the impact plaintiff\u2019s car was thrown back eight or ten feet and he was seriously hurt. Osage avenue descends slightly to the west between Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh streets; and defendant\u2019s driver did not appear to have the truck under control as he came to the latter street. On the question of his negligence the case was clearly for the jury.\nThe trial court, however, granted a nonsuit, on the assumption that as matter of law plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. This in our opinion was error. Plaintiff was on the proper side of the street with his car under control and stopped before he came to the intersecting avenue. He had a right to assume that defendant\u2019s truck would come to the crossing at moderate speed and under control, as it should have done: McClung v. Penna. T. Cab. Co., 252 Pa. 478. No man is bound to anticipate the negligence of another: Wagner v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 252 Pa. 354. Because the truck was moving rapidly when five hundred feet away did not show th,at it would continue to do so to the end of the avenue. Plaintiff knew it must turn north or south at Forty-seventh street, but he did not know which and was not required to anticipate that it would do either recklessly. True, plaintiff testifies that at the speed the truck was moving it was necessary to cut the corner short or upset the coal, but does not say he knew or anticipated in advance that the turn would be made at such speed or in that manner. As plaintiff stopped before reaching the intersection, it cannot be declared as matter of law that he was negligent in not sounding his horn, especially in view of his testimony that when the danger appeared he considered it his first duty to stop his car and he had not time to do both.\nThe judgment is reversed with a procedendo.",

Daley.\nNegligence \u2014 Automobiles\u2014Right-angle collision \u2014 Absence of lights \u2014 Sudden turning of curve \u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Sudden danger \u2014 Sounding horn \u2014 Case for jury.\n1. A driver of an automobile approaching a street intersection has the right to assume that another automobile, approaching on the intersecting street, will do so at a moderate speed and under control. No man is bound to anticipate the negligence of another.\n2. In an action' to recover for personal injuries sustained in a right-angle collision between two automobiles at night, the case is for the jury and the court erred in entering a compulsory nonsuit, where it appeared that plaintiff, when 250 feet from the intersection, saw defendant\u2019s truck approaching; that plaintiff was driving at the rate of twelve miles per hour and defendant at about twice that speed; that there was no light on defendant\u2019s truck, and it approached the intersection without warning; that plaintiff was on his right hand side of the street and his headlights were burning; that the truck came rapidly around the corner and violently collided with the front of plaintiff\u2019s car, which was stopped about three feet short of the curb, and that by the impact plaintiff\u2019s car was thrown back about eight or ten feet and plaintiff was seriously injured; and while the street on which' defendant\u2019s truck approached came to a dead end when it entered the street on which plaintiff was driving, there was no indication until just before the collision as to which way the driver of the truck intended to turn.\nS. As the plaintiff stopped before reaching the intersection,- it cannot be declared as matter of law that he was negligent in not sounding his horn, especially in view of his testimony that when the danger appeared he considered it hi? first dhty to stop his car and he had not time to do both,\nArgued Jan. 22, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 294, Jan. T., 1917, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1916, No. 4224, refusing to take off compulsory nonsuit in case of Elmer E. Bew v. John Daley, Jr., Inc.\nBefore Potter, Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nReversed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Barratt, P. J.\nThe facts appear from the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe lower court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in refusing to take off the nonsuit.\nAugustus Trask Ashton and Victor Frey submitted for appellant.\nThe question whether plaintiff exercised sufficient caution in approaching the intersection was for the jury: McClung v. Penna. Taximeter Cab Co., 252 Pa. 478; Wagner v. P. R. T. Co., 252 Pa. 354.\nMaurice W. Sloan submitted for appellee.\nThe non-suit was properly entered: Gosling v. Gross, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 304; Ellison v. Atlantic Refining Co., 62 Pa. Superior Ct. 370; McClung v. Penna. Taximeter Cab Co., 252 Pa. 478.\nFebruary 25, 1918:"
