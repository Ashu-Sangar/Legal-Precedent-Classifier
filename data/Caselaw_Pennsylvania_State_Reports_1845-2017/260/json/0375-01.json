Widener et al., Executors.\nContracts \u2014 Principal and agent-* \u2014 Contracts by agent on behalf of principal \u2014 Authority of agent to act \u2014 Architects.\nNo recovery can. be had upon a contract for the installing of mail chutes in a building in the course of construction, under the supervision of an architect, where the contract upon which the action was brought was alleged to have been made by the architect on behalf of the owners of the property, but where it appeared that the architect had no authority to make any such contract.\nArgued J,an. 15,1918.\nAppeal, No. 209, Jan. T., 1917, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Philadelphia Co., March T., 1916, No. 4001, refusing to take off nonsuit, in case of American Mailing Device Corporation v. Joseph E. Widener and George D. Widener, Executors of Peter A. B. Widener, deeeas\u00e9d.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for breach of contract. Before Patterson, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the action was brought against the executors of Peter A. B. Widener upon a verbal contract alleged to have been made by Mr. Widener \u201cthrough his duly authorized agents and employees\u201d on or about the 15th day of January, 1915, for the erection of mail chutes in the Widener building.\nThe only person whom the plaintiff attempted to .show was the decedent\u2019s agent was Horace Trumbauer, the architect of the building. That Mr. Trumbauer was the architect was admitted by the pleadings and was shown by the contract between Mr. Widener and the Geo. A. Fuller Company for the erection of the building; that contract did not give Mr. Trumbauer any powers other than those ordinarily given to supervising architects in the erection of buildings. There was no other evidence of any authority to Mr. Trumbauer to enter into a contract on the defendants\u2019 behalf.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit, which it subsequently refused to take off. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing to take off the nonsuit.\nJoseph L. McAleer, for appellant.\nEllis Ames Ballard, for appellees.\nFebruary 25, 1918:"
