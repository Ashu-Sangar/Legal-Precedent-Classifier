        "text": "OPINION\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, affirming in part an order of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission) directed against Transit Casualty Insurance Company (Transit).\nTransit, by its sales and underwriting agent, Markel Service, Inc. (Markel), had issued commercial motor vehicle liability insurance to Beverage Transportation, Inc. (Beverage), effective from February 18,1970, to February 18,1972. Nettie M. Renoll, employed by Beverage as a vehicle driver, was involved in an accident on March 18, 1970, during the period of Transit\u2019s insurance coverage, while driving a vehicle of Beverage. Markel notified Beverage that RenolPs insurance coverage would terminate on July 10, 1970, and that she should be relieved of all driving duties by that date. As a result, Renoll\u2019s employment with Beverage was terminated on July 10, 1970.\nRenoll filed a complaint with the Commission alleging Beverage had discharged her due to her sex. In two amended complaints Renoll named Transit as a respondent and charged Transit with violating Section 5(e) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, which makes it unlawful\n\u201c(e) For any person, whether or not an employer, employment agency, labor organization or employe, to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice, or to obstruct or prevent any person from complying with the provisions of this act or any order issued thereunder, or to attempt, directly or indirectly, to commit any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.\u201d\nSection 5(a) of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(a), makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice for any employer to discharge an employee because of that person\u2019s sex.\nIn March, 1972, after its policy with Transit was terminated, Beverage rehired Renoll as a truck driver. Renoll\u2019s complaint against Beverage was then withdrawn.\nOn October 15, 1973, the Commission conducted hearings on Renoll\u2019s complaint against Transit. On July 29, 1974, the Commission concluded that Transit, through its agent Markel, had withdrawn insurance coverage for Renoll because of her sex and that Transit\u2019s conduct \u201ccoerced and compelled Beverage to discharge Renoll.\u201d Transit was ordered to cease and desist from such activities and to pay Renoll damages of $12,147.03 with interest for lost pay from July 10, 1970, through February 18, 1972.\nTransit filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the Commission\u2019s order but modified the amount of the award to $11,499.49 with interest. We granted allocatur.\nThe central issue is the Commission\u2019s authority to order a \u201crespondent,\u201d who is not the employer of the complainant, to compensate complainant through the payment of lost earnings where that respondent has engaged in an unlawful discriminatory employment practice causing the loss suffered.\nHowever, before reaching that issue, we must determine whether the Commission properly concluded Transit committed an unlawful discriminatory practice in violation of the Act.\nI\nAs stated in Section 10 of the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 960, our scope of review is governed by the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 1, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.1 et seq. [Hereinafter: 71 P.S. \u00a7 -], which permits us to set aside or modify the Commission\u2019s adjudication only if it \u201cis in violation of the constitutional rights of the appellant, or is not in accordance with law\u201d or if \u201cany finding of fact made by the agency and necessary to support its adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.44. See also PHRC v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967) and Gorchov Brothers Real Estate v. HRC, 14 Pa.Cmwlth. 310, 321 A.2d 405 (1974).\nTransit contends the Commission\u2019s finding of an unlawful discriminatory practice is not supported by substantial evidence. The record demonstrates otherwise.\nThe Commission made the following relevant findings of fact:\n\u201c12. Respondent\u2019s decision to prohibit the Complainant from driving a truck for Beverage was made with the knowledge that Complainant was a woman.\n\u201c13. Respondent\u2019s explanation that this decision with regard to Complainant was based solely on the fact that the Complainant was under twenty-five and was consonant with Respondent\u2019s policy of taking a \u2018much closer look at a driver under twenty-five who is involved in an accident\u2019 is belied by the record:\na. During the relevant period, at least four male Beverage drivers under twenty-five had been involved in accidents for which they were deemed liable and had not been canceled by Respondent. Respondent offered no acceptable explanation for the disparity in treatment between these males and the Complainant, the sole female driver employed . . .. Complainant was the only driver canceled after an accident during the period relevant hereto. .\n\u201c14. Respondent\u2019s instruction to Beverage to relieve Complainant of all driving duties coerced and compelled Beverage to discharge Complainant.\u201d\nIn Finding of Fact No. 12, the Commission determined Markel\u2019s decision to exclude Renoll was made with knowledge of her sex. Transit argues, to the contrary, that Markel\u2019s decision was made on June 10, 1970, and, at that time, Markel believed Renoll was a male driver under twenty-five years of age. The record supports the Commission\u2019s finding.\nIn a letter dated June 1, 1970, Markel was informed Renoll was twenty-three years old. On June 10, 1970, Markel ordered \u201cMr.\u201d Renoll to be removed as a driver \u201cunless the insured has some redeeming features to offer on this individual . . \u201d [Emphasis added.] On June 12, 1970, information regarding Renoll\u2019s high qualifications and performance as a driver, as well as a correction of her sex identity, was transmitted to Markel. On July 2, 1970, Beverage was advised Renoll had been removed from coverage and should be relieved of all driving duties.\nThis correspondence provides substantial evidence from which the Commission could find the June 10 decision was not final and was, in fact, contingent upon receipt of more information. Thus, the Commission's conclusion that Markel\u2019s decision to exclude Renoll was made with knowledge of her sex is supported by substantial evidence.\nFinding of Fact No. 13 refers to Transit\u2019s asserted policy of excluding the high-risk-under-twenty-five year old driver from coverage. Transit contends its decision to exclude Renoll from coverage was based upon this policy rather than upon her sex identity.\nTransit\u2019s witness, Arthur S. Wilson, testified the underwriting policy of Markel was to relieve from driving duties any driver of any of its insured who was involved in an accident and was under twenty-five years of age. This testimony was reinforced by Transit\u2019s letter of September 20, 1970, which reiterated the high-risk-under-twenty-five policy and added that the cause of the accident and the degree of the insured driver\u2019s responsibility were factors to be considered in applying the policy.\nThe Commission rejected this explanation for cancellation of Renoll\u2019s coverage. In doing so, the Commission relied on the testimony of one of its own investigators .that the insurance coverage of four under-twenty-five male drivers for Beverage had not been canceled, even though each had also been involved in accidents. While two of these accidents may not have come to Markel\u2019s attention because they were covered by Beverage\u2019s collision policy with another insurance company, Markel offered no acceptable explanation for its failure to exclude the other two under-twenty-five male drivers.\nAccordingly, the Commission\u2019s Finding No. 13 is supported by substantial evidence in the record: Markel did not adhere to its alleged underwriting policy because the decision to exclude Renoll from coverage was based not upon such a policy but upon her sex identity. Thus, the Commission\u2019s Finding No. 14, that Transit coerced and compelled Beverage to discharge Renoll, was reasonable and must be sustained.\nII\nWe now turn to the central issue in this case. Having determined Transit violated Section 5(e) of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(e), the Commission ordered Transit to cease and desist its unlawful discriminatory practice and to pay Renoll her lost earnings for the period spanning July 10, 1970, the date of discharge, to February 18, 1972, the date on which the insurance policy between Transit and Beverage expired. Transit asserts the Commission\u2019s award was not in accordance with law because the Commission has no authority to order anyone other than an employer of the complainant to pay lost earnings to that complainant.\nThe Commission\u2019s authority to grant relief upon a finding of unlawful employment discrimination is contained in Section 9 of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 959 which provides in part:\n\u201cIf upon all the evidence at the hearing, the Commission shall find that a respondent has engaged in or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in this act, the Commission shall state its finding of fact, and shall issue ... an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action including but not limited to hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employes, with or without back pay ... as, in the judgment of the Commission, will effectuate the purposes of this act . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added.]\nSection 9 makes it clear the Commission is not limited to ordering only the types of relief specified therein. The Legislature has incorporated in Section 9 a rule of construction which requires that a statute be read in a manner which will effectuate its purposes. The Legislature has specifically given the Commission authority \u201cto take such affirmative action . . . as, in the judgment of the Commission, will effectuate the purposes of this act.\u201d\nOne of the policies of the Act is \u201cto foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their . . . sex . . . and to safeguard their right to obtain and hold employment without discrimination . . . .\u201d Section 2(b) of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 952(b).\nMoreover, in Section 12(a), 43 P.S. \u00a7 962(a), the Legislature has directel that the provisions of the Act are to be construed liberally in order to accomplish the stated purposes. We have repeatedly upheld the principle of the Act\u2019s liberal construction in defining the Commission\u2019s remedial powers.\n\u201cThe words \u2018as in the judgment of the Commission\u2019 indicate to us that the Legislature recognized that only an administrative agency with broad remedial powers, exercising particular expertise, could cope effectively with the pervasive problem of unlawful discrimination. Accordingly, the Legislature vested in the Commission, quite properly, maximum flexibility to remedy and hopefully eradicate the \u2018evils\u2019 of discrimination.\u201d\nPennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Alto-Reste Cemetery Association, 453 Pa. 124, 133-34, 306 A.2d 881, 887 (1973) . See also Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester Housing Authority, 458 Pa. 67, 327 A.2d 335 (1974) ; Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967).\nThere is, however, a correlative that a statute be read so as to effectuate its purpose \u2014 viz., that an administrative agency can only exercise those powers which have been conferred upon it by the Legislature in clear and unmistakable language. But, we conclude the power to order payment of lost earnings by a person or entity other than an employer has been conferred on the Commission by the Legislature.\nFirst, the award of lost earnings amounted to an award of \u201cback pay\u201d which is expressly authorized by Section 9. 43 P.S. \u00a7 959; Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Freeport Area School District, 467 Pa. 522, 359 A.2d 724 (1976). Second, Section 5(e) of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(e), clearly expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent that \u201cany person, whether or not an employer \u201d can be held responsible for an unlawful discriminatory employment practice. [Emphasis added.] Third, Section 9 of the Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 959, authorizes the Commission to order affirmative action by a \u201crespondent,\u201d not merely by an employer.\nTransit argues a non-employer should not be required to pay back salary since the statute literally read permits the Commission to order a respondent to hire, reinstate, or upgrade an employee with back pay. Transit contends that, since Renoll is not its employee, it cannot hire, reinstate or upgrade Renoll, and thus is not subject to a back-pay award.\nThe Commonwealth Court, in affirming the Commission\u2019s order, rejected Transit\u2019s argument. We concur.\n\u201cTo relieve this respondent of paying lost earnings merely because it cannot reinstate or upgrade the complainant, as an employer could, would be to distort beyond reason the purpose of the Act. It could be argued also that the respondent actually is in a position to \u2018upgrade\u2019 the complainant as an employee of Beverage by ceasing its unlawful discrimination, for the notion of \u2018upgrade\u2019 most certainly refers to terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, and a condition of employment as a truck driver here was effective insurance coverage and the absence of such coverage is attributable to the respondent. Having been ordered to cease these discriminatory practices, the respondent, although not an employer, was ordered in effect to upgrade the complainant\u2019s employment status to the equivalent status of the male employees.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]\nCommonwealth, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Transit Casualty Insurance Company, 20 Pa.Cmwlth. 43, 53, 340 A.2d 624, 629 (1975).\nThe purpose of Section 9, 43 P.S. \u00a7 959, is to make the party responsible for the discrimination also responsible for compensating the injured party. Under Section 5(e), 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(e), a non-employer may be responsible for a discriminatory employment practice. Thus, we must conclude the statute authorizes the Commission to order a respondent, whether or not an employer of the complainant, to compensate that complainant through the payment of back pay where the respondent is responsible for the loss through an unlawful discriminatory practice.\nOrder affirmed.\n. Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, \u00a7 5, as amended by the Act of March 28, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1354, \u00a7 1, and as further amended by the Act of February 28, 1961, P.L. 47, \u00a7 2, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(e) [Hereinafter: 43 P.S. \u00a7---].\n.
