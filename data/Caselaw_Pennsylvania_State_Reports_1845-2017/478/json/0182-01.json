        "text": "OPINION\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Constance Dussinger, also known as Constance Kelley, was tried by a judge and jury and was convicted of two counts of murder of the second degree, robbery, and criminal conspiracy. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment. Sentence was suspended on the robbery and conspiracy convictions. The homicide convictions were appealed directly to this court, while the non-homicide convictions were appealed to Superior Court, which certified those appeals to this court.\nThe facts are as follows. On July 3, 1974, the partially decomposed bodies of Willie Billingsley and Ernest Barnes were discovered in Billingsley\u2019s Philadelphia residence. Both victims died of gunshot wounds to the head. The medical examiner found it impossible to accurately determine the times of death, but he estimated that both deaths occurred between 6:00 a. m. on Monday, July 1, 1974 and 6:00 p. m. on Tuesday, July 2, 1974.\nDuring their investigation, police discovered that Billingsley held at his residence Monday-night poker games involving large sums of money. Police discovered that a game was held on July 1, 1974, two days before the bodies were discovered. Investigation further revealed that Billingsley, during the week prior to his death, had \u201chit a number\u201d for well over one thousand dollars. Despite the foregoing facts, no money was found on either of the victims or in the house. Further, when Billingsley\u2019s body was discovered, the pockets of his trousers were pulled out and a large glass bank was broken into two pieces.\nDuring their investigation, the police found that appellant had been employed by Billingsley to serve food and drinks at his weekly poker games. She was originally questioned concerning Billingsley\u2019s background; however, she subsequently gave police an inculpatory statement. According to appellant, in late June of 1974, a co-defendant, Ervin Warren, had stolen approximately $1,500 worth of payroll checks. Warren gave the checks to appellant, who gave them to Billingsley. Warren later decided to cash the checks himself and told appellant to get the checks back. When appellant forgot to get the checks, Warren, appellant and co-defendant Charles Jackson went to Billingsley\u2019s home to recover the checks. Appellant knew both the purpose of the trip and that both of her companions had guns.\nOnce inside the Billingsley residence, Jackson handed appellant a gun and instructed her to keep it pointed at Barnes, who was sleeping on a couch. Warren and Jackson then accompanied Billingsley to the upper floor of the house. Appellant stated that five minutes later she heard two or three shots from upstairs, which startled her, causing the gun she was holding to accidentally discharge, killing Barnes. Appellant stated that she then fled the premises and returned home.\nAppellant first argues that the trial court erred in refusing her demurrer to the conspiracy and robbery indictments. She argues that since she neither took anything nor intended to participate in a robbery, the charges of conspiracy and robbery should not have been submitted to the jury.\nThe issue as presented to this Court is not properly preserved for appellate review.\nIn Commonwealth v. Ilgenfritz, 466 Pa. 345, 353 A.2d 387 (1976), stated:\n\u201cThe Appellant frames this question in terms of whether the trial court erred in not sustaining his demurrer to the evidence for lack of proof of cause of death. Since, however, the defendant did not rest following this adverse ruling, but elected to put in a case in defense, the correctness of the ruling on the demurrer is no longer an available issue. See Commonwealth v. Moore, 398 Pa. 198, 201-202, 157 A.2d 65 (1959); Commonwealth v. Spanos, 167 Pa.Super. 629, 631, 76 A.2d 243 (1950). But see Commonwealth v. Henderson, 451 Pa. 452, 304 A.2d 154 (1973). We have chosen, nevertheless, to treat the question as if properly framed, namely, whether the trial court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment. In doing so, of course, we consider all of the evidence at trial, not only that contained in the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief. See Commonwealth v. Terenda, 433 Pa. 519, 252 A.2d 635 (1969); Commonwealth v. Tabb, 417 Pa. 13, 207 A.2d 884 (1965); Commonwealth v. Moore, supra; Commonwealth v. Kohne, 204 Pa.Super. 78, 203 A.2d 401 (1964); Commonwealth v. Gomori, 192 Pa.Super. 325, 161 A.2d 649 (1960); Commonwealth v. Cerzullo, 175 Pa.Super. 330, 104 A.2d 179 (1954).\u201d\nThe appellant in the instant case, presented a defense. Therefore as in Ilgenfritz, supra we will treat her challenge as one to the sufficiency of the evidence rather than one challenging the correctness of the trial court\u2019s rulings on the demurrers.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 344 A.2d 824 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cThe test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Robson, 461 Pa. 615, 625, 337 A.2d 573, 578 (1975); Commonwealth v. Boyd, 461 Pa. 17, 24, 334 A.2d 610, 613 (1975); Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 605, 608, 334 A.2d 255, 257 (1975). Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. Commonwealth v. Robson, supra; Commonwealth v. Murray, supra; Commonwealth v. Smith, 457 Pa. 638, 326 A.2d 60, 61 (1974); Commonwealth v. Paquette, 451 Pa. 250, 257, 301 A.2d 837, 841 (1973). The fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. Commonwealth v. Robson, supra; Commonwealth v. Smith, supra.\u201d\nA review of the evidence in light of this standard makes clear that sufficient evidence is in record to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions for conspiracy and robbery.\nIn Commonwealth v. Mobley, 467 Pa. 460, 463, 359 A.2d 367, 368 (1976), we stated:\n\u201c . . . It is well-established that a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence as well as by direct evidence. Commonwealth v. Eiland, 450 Pa. 566, 570, 301 A.2d 651, 652 (1973); Commonwealth v. Batley, 436 Pa. 377, 392, 260 A.2d 793, 801 (1970); Commonwealth v. Yobbagy, 410 Pa. 172, 177, 188 A.2d 750, 752 (1963). \u2018Although more than a mere association must be shown, \u201c \u2018[a] conspiracy may be inferentially established by showing the relation, conduct, or circumstances of the relation, conduct, or circumstances of the parties, and the overt acts on the part of co-conspirators have uniformly been held competent to prove that a corrupt confederation has in fact been formed: . . . \u201d\u201d Commonwealth v. Eiland, supra; Commonwealth v. Neff, 407 Pa. 1, 6, 179 A.2d 630, 632 (1962); Commonwealth v. Horvath, 187 Pa.Super. 206, 211, 144 A.2d 489, 492 (1958).\u201d\nIn the instant case, appellant knew that her co-defendants intended to recover the stolen checks, even if the use of the handguns was necessary. Despite this, appellant went along with the pair and helped them gain entrance into the victim\u2019s home. From this evidence, it is reasonable to infer that appellant agreed with her co-defendants to rob the victim.\nThe same holds true for the charge of robbery. The Crimes Code provides:\n\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or both.\n\u201c(b) Conduct of another .--A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:\n\u201c(1) acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct;\n\u201c(2) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by this title or by the law defining the offense; or\n\u201c(3) he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.\n\u201c(c) Accomplice defined. \u2014 A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:\n\u201c(1) with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:\n\u201c(i) solicits such other person to commit it; or \u201c(ii) aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it . . . (Emphasis added.)\nAct of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 306.\nThe evidence m the instant case was clearly sufficient to uphold a finding that appellant was an accomplice and thus accountable for the actions of her co-defendants. Since we have already found sufficient evidence to prove a conspiracy, it follows that it has also been shown that appellant has \u201cagreed to aid\u201d in the planning or commission of a robbery. Appellant is thus an accomplice, making her accountable for the actions of her co-defendants under \u00a7 306 of the Crimes Code. The evidence is also sufficient to show that the co-defendants were guilty of robbery, as a reasonable inference may be drawn that the co-defendants used force to take, or in an attempt to take, the victims\u2019 money. This is shown by the evidence that the pockets of one of the victims were outturned, and the evidence that a glass bank in Billingsley\u2019s home was broken with no money left. The evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions of robbery and conspiracy.\nAppellant next argues that the court below erred in refusing to suppress her confession. She advances two theories to support her contention. She first alleges the confession was the product of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment, thus violative of Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 and our decision in Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972). She also argues that the confession was constitutionally involuntary. We disagree with both contentions.\nThe facts are as follows. Police located appellant in late July, when she returned a call to Detective Rosenstein of the Philadelphia police. Appellant voluntarily accompanied police to the Police Administration Building, where they arrived at 1:10 p. m. on July 29, 1974. Appellant was not a suspect; police wanted to interview her because she had worked for the victim at his card games. After being placed in an interview room, appellant was left alone until 1:55 p. m. She was not informed of her constitutional rights because she was not a suspect. By 3:30 p. m., Detective Rosenstein had uncovered enough inconsistencies in appellant\u2019s story to warn her of her constitutional rights and to ask her to take a polygraph examination. Appellant agreed to take the exam.\nBetween 3:30 and 5:05, appellant was not questioned. At 5:05 p. m., appellant was again warned of her constitutional rights, which she waived. The polygraph examination was conducted between 5:20 p. m. and 6:35 p. m. After the test, appellant was informed that polygraph results indicated deception on her part and she was again warned of her constitutional rights. Immediately after waiving these rights, appellant gave an inculpatory statement which began at 7:00 p. m. and was completed at 9:30 p. m. She was arraigned sometime thereafter.\nAppellant claims that the confession should have been suppressed because of Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 and our decision in Commonwealth v. Futch, supra. We need not reach the merits of this claim, however, since it has not been preserved for appellate review.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 323(d) provides:\n\u201cThe application shall state specifically the evidence sought to be suppressed, the specific constitutional grounds rendering the evidence inadmissible, and shall state with particularity the facts and events in support thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAppellant\u2019s suppression motion makes no mention of either Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 or Commonwealth v. Futch, supra. In fact, the motion contains the following heading:\n\u201cPETITION TO SUPPRESS A CONFESSION AND EVIDENCE OBTAINED AS THE RESULT OF A POLYGRAPH TEST ON THE GROUNDS OF INVOLUNTARINESS AND DENIAL OF THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\u201d\nAs we have held that a claim of voluntariness is insufficient to preserve a Futch claim, Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 464 Pa. 117, 346 A.2d 48 (1975), we need not consider this claim.\nAppellant next alleges that the confession should have been suppressed on grounds of involuntariness. Appel-Iant, a self-admitted heroin addict, claims she was suffering withdrawal symptoms during questioning, thus allowing her will to be overborne, rendering the confession inadmissible.\nIn Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 361 A.2d 282 (1976), we stated:\n\u201c . . . Although there is no single litmus-paper test for determining the voluntariness of a confession, it must be established that the decision to speak was a product of a free and unconstrained choice of its maker. . All attending circumstances surrounding the confession must be considered in this determination. These include: the duration and methods of the interrogation; the length of delay between arrest and arraignment; the conditions of detainment; the attitudes of the police toward defendant; defendant\u2019s physical and psychological state; and all other conditions present which may serve to drain one\u2019s power of resistance to suggestion or to undermine one\u2019s self-determination.\u201d (Citations omitted.)\nWe have also said:\n\u201cOur review is limited to determining whether the findings of the court below are supported by the record and whether the inferences and legal conclusions based thereon are correct. Further, we need consider only the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and so much of the appellant\u2019s evidence as remains uncontradicted.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 476 Pa. 344, 382 A.2d 1202 (1978).\nWhile appellant testified she was suffering from withdrawal during the interrogation process, the suppression court found that appellant:\n\u201c . . . appeared alert and responsive at all times. She was not mistreated or abused. No threats were made against her, and no promises were made to her. She appeared to be in no pain and made no request to Detective Rosenstem. She was not under the influence of narcotics and was not suffering the effects of withdrawal.\u201d (Finding of Fact # 14.)\nOur review of the record indicates these findings of fact are supported by the record. We further can find no evidence of the Commonwealth\u2019s or uncontradicted evidence of appellant\u2019s which would require us to overturn the suppression court\u2019s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.\nAppellant next complains that the court erred in overruling a defense objection to the following exchange during the cross-examination of defense witness Denise Walker.\n\u201cMR. DeSIMONE (District Attorney)\n\u201cQ. Do you remember being asked this question: \u2018Has Tom\u2019 \u2014 your boyfriend \u2014 \u2018spoken to you regarding these murders?\n\u2018Answer: When I told him that you\u2019 \u2014 meaning Detective Rosenstein \u2014 \u2018wanted to speak to Connie about it, he said she probably knows what happened.\u2019\nDo you remember that?\n\u201cMR. LERNER (Defense counsel): I will object to it.\n\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes.\n\u201cTHE COURT: What is your objection?\n\u201cMR. LERNER: To hearsay.\n\u201cMR. DeSIMONE: Statement by her.\n\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.\n\u201cBY MR. DeSIMONE:\n\u201cQ. Is that right?\n\u201cA. Yes.\n\u201cQ. So Tom didn\u2019t even know anything about it, did he?\n\u201cA. He didn\u2019t\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)\nAppellant claims she was prejudiced by the admission of the hearsay statement. She does not, however, explain how the remark prejudiced her case. As the trial court stated in its opinion:\n\u201c . . . The utterance by Saunders (Tom) which the witness had related to Rosenstein and was made to repeat to the jury, was not factual, but on its face, mere surmise on Saunders\u2019 part. Further, it did not charge defendant with participation in or presence at the crime, but only with some knowledge of it, which might have been quite innocent. . . . \u201d\nSince appellant knew about the homicides before being contacted by police, we agree with the trial court\u2019s characterization.\nAs we stated in Commonwealth v. Palmer, 463 Pa. 26, 36, 342 A.2d 387, 392 (1975):\n\u201c . . . \u2018 \u201c[ejvery unwise or irrelevant remark made in the course of a trial by a judge, a witness, or counsel does not compel the granting of a new trial\u201d \u2019. Rather the remark must be \u2018 \u201cof such a nature or substance or delivered in such a manner that it may reasonably be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial\u201d\u2019. [Emphasis in original.] Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 611, 301 A.2d 673, 674 (1973), quoting from Commonwealth v. Phillips, 183 Pa.Super. 377, 382, 132 A.2d 733 (1957).\u201d\nWe do not believe the challenged remark can be said to have deprived appellant of a fair trial.\nAppellant next claims she was denied a fair trial because the judge who heard her suppression motion was the same judge who had presided at the trial of her co-defendant Warren. Appellant argues that since she was implicated in the killings at the co-defendant\u2019s trial, the judge who presided at both cases had received prejudicial information at the co-defendant\u2019s trial, making it impossible to judge appellant\u2019s credibility against the credibility of police. We need not reach the merits of the claim, however, because at the suppression hearing, appellant, without objection, allowed into evidence testimony that she admitted killing one of the victims and allowed her full statement to be admitted into evidence. By allowing the admission of this evidence at the suppression hearing, appellant allowed the suppression judge to learn the same \u201cprejudicial\u201d information which was received at the co-defendant\u2019s trial. Under these circumstances, appellant is now precluded from raising this issue.\nAppellant finally argues that the trial court erred in refusing her requested instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Since this crime was committed after the effective date of the new Crimes Code, appellant was entitled to the charge upon request. Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 378 A.2d 1199 (1977). (Opinion of Roberts, J., joined by O\u2019Brien, J. and Manderino, J., announcing the decision of the court); Commonwealth v. Polimeni, 474 Pa. 430, 378 A.2d 1189 (1977).

See Commonwealth v. Polimeni, 474 Pa. 430, 442, 378 A.2d 1189, 1196 (opinion of POMEROY, J., joined by EAGEN, C. J., announcing the decision of the Court). See also Commonwealth v.

J., announcing the decision of the Court); Commonwealth v. Gartner, 475 Pa. 512, 532, 381 A.2d 114, 124 (1977) (POMEROY, J., concurring). In the case now before us there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could rationally conclude that the crime, if any, for which Dussinger could properly be convicted would be involuntary manslaughter. Since the trial judge refused a timely request for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, I concur in the conclusion that a new trial on the homicide charge is required. The question whether a defendant is always entitled to such a charge is not present on this record and should be left for another day.\nEAGEN, C. J., joins in this concurring opinion.\n. In the appeal from the judgments of sentence for robbery and conspiracy at No. 387, I join in Mr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN\u2019s opinion.\n. Appellant\u2019s statement to the police, which was read into evidence, essentially stated that she did not know that she was part of a robbery when she went into Willie Billingsley\u2019s house and that the gun she later held near Ernest Barnes discharged accidentally when she was startled by the sound of gunfire from upstairs. In light of her statement, the facts that appellant did not move the involuntary manslaughter indictment to trial at the outset of the case and that she presented testimony seeking to establish an alibi do not mean that a verdict of involuntary manslaughter was impermissible. See Commonwealth v. Ford, 474 Pa. 480, 485, 378 A.2d 1215, 1218 (1977) (opinion of POMEROY, J., joined by EAGEN, C. J., announcing the decision of the Court); Commonwealth v.

The jury is entitled to believe all, part, or none of the evidence presented by witnesses at trial. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Scoggins, 466 Pa. 355, 359, 353 A.2d 392 (1976); Commonwealth v.

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\nconcurring.\nToday\u2019s decision requires that I repeat my disagreement with the various theories expounded by my brethren in the Ford, Garcia, and Polimeni decisions. Commonwealth v. Ford, 474 Pa. 480, 486, 378 A.2d 1215, 1218 (1977) (NIX, J., dissenting); Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 471, 378 A.2d 1199, 1210 (1977) (NIX, J., dissenting); Commonwealth v. Polimeni, 474 Pa. 430, 449, 378 A.2d 1189, 1199 (1977) (NIX, J., dissenting). I remain unconvinced that the adherence to a lesser included offense analysis or to a theory of a jury\u2019s \u201cmercy-dispensing power\u201d compels an unconditional right in all murder trials to an involuntary manslaughter instruction upon request by the defense. Nor do I believe that an instruction for involuntary manslaughter should be allowed simply because there may be a reasonable basis in the evidence to support a finding of involuntary manslaughter. See Commonwealth v. Ford, supra, 474 at 485, 378 A.2d at 1216 (POMEROY, J., announcing the decision of this Court); Commonwealth v. Garcia, supra, 474 Pa. at 470, 378 A.2d at 1210 (POMEROY, J., concurring); Commonwealth v. Polimeni, supra, 474 Pa. at 447, 378 A.2d at 1191 (POMER-OY, J., announcing the decision of this Court). I do, however, accept the conclusion that the requested manslaughter instruction in this case was improperly denied, because such a charge was essential under the evidence presented to inform the jury of the competing contentions raised in the lawsuit. I therefore agree that the second degree murder conviction returned in this action must be reversed.\nIn the present lawsuit, appellant did not contest that she caused the death of Ernest Barnes or that the killing did not constitute a criminal homicide. The critical issue at trial was whether there was a malicious killing (i. e., one committed in the course of the commission of the felony of robbery) or a nonmalicious unintentional killing (involuntary manslaughter). Thus, we are here presented with a situation where the factual dispute centers upon the presence or absence of the element of malice, the element which distinguishes the higher grade of homicide from the lesser grade. This is precisely the type of situation where an instruction on the lesser offense, upon request, is warranted. See Commonwealth v. Manning, 477 Pa. 495, 500, 384 A.2d 1197, 1199 (1978) (NIX, J., dissenting); Commonwealth v. Gartner and Pfaff, 475 Pa. 512, 516 n. 3, 381 A.2d 114, 125 n. 3 (1977) (NIX, J., concurring and dissenting). Where the factual posture effectively excludes a realistic possibility of an acquittal, as is the case here, to deprive the accused of her right to allow the jury to consider the lesser offense is tantamount to depriving her of a defense. Where instructions on the lesser offense are given, the verdict will necessarily reflect the jury\u2019s resolution of the disputed factual issue at trial. The finding of the higher verdict would evidence the prosecutor\u2019s success in establishing the disputed element. Likewise the return of a guilty verdict on the lesser offense would reflect his failure to establish that element which distinguishes the two offenses.\nA rational basis theory would allow the instruction of involuntary manslaughter even though the dispute relates to an element which is common to both the higher and lesser degree of a crime. See Commonwealth v. Gartner and Pfaff, 475 Pa. 512, 516 n. 3, 381 A.2d 114, 125 n. 3 (1977) (NIX, J., concurring and dissenting).",

In my view, appellant was denied due process of law when the judge who presided at the trial of appellant\u2019s co-defendant also presided at appellant\u2019s suppression hearing unbeknownst to defense counsel. Under the circumstances of this case, where the evidence at co-defendant\u2019s trial, other than appellant\u2019s confession, implicated her in the homicide/robbery for which she is now charged, it was impossible for the judge to impartially consider the arguments presented in appellant\u2019s suppression motion and to impartially weigh appellant\u2019s credibility against the credibility of the police.\nThe majority refused to reach the merits of appellant\u2019s argument, reasoning that at the suppression hearing, appellant did not object to the admission of her statement that she admitted killing one of the victims. The majority asserts that appellant therefore allowed the suppression judge to hear the same incriminating evidence which he heard at the earlier trial, thus appellant was not prejudiced and cannot now complain.\nIn this appeal, as is usually the case, the resolution of issues involving voluntariness and pre-arraignment delay will turn on the credibility of the police officers and the defendant. That assessment of credibility should be made by an impartial judge who has not previously been exposed to evidence indicating the defendant\u2019s guilt. The judge in this case had, prior to the suppression hearing, presided at the trial of appellant\u2019s co-defendant. At that trial, testimony was presented that appellant had been seen standing over the victim\u2019s body with a gun in her hand. Having one\u2019s credibility judged by someone who has previously been exposed to such incriminating evidence violated due process. Such a due process violation is not vitiated by the fact that appellant allowed the alleged confession to be read to the suppression court. At the suppression hearing, appellant challenged the statement as being involuntary. As such, she indirectly challenged its truthfulness. She should not have been forced to do that before a judge who had previously heard evidence concerning that issue. I therefore dissent.",
