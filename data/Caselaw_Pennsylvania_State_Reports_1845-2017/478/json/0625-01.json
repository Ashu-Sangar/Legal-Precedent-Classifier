I also agree with the Court that the record contains sufficient evidence from which to conclude respondent had engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices.\nI must once again dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s holding that the Human Relations Commission has no statutory authority to award compensatory damages to persons genuinely injured by unlawful discrimination.

Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court in part and reinstate the order of the PHRC.\nBecause, however, the majority affirms the order of the Commonwealth Court modifying the award of damages, the Court should remand the proceedings to the PHRC to allow it to enter an appropriate remedial order in light of today\u2019s decision.\nNIX, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
