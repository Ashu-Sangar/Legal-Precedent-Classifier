Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, the Commission found that the Governours Place Apartments had engaged in unlawful discrimination and on December 26, 1972, ordered them to take certain corrective actions. GPA appealed the Commission\u2019s order to Commonwealth Court, which held that there was not substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding of unlawful discrimination. A petition for allowance of appeal to this Court was then filed by the Commission and granted on October 18, 1973.\nThe Commission argues that their adjudication of unlawful discrimination was supported by substantial evidence and that the Commonwealth Court erred in setting aside their December 26, 1972 order. We have reviewed the record and find that there is not substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding of unlawful discrimination.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a Concurring Opinion.\nPOMEROY, J., concurs in the result.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\n.

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAppellant Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission found that appellee St. Andrews Development Company violated the Pennsylvania Human Relations Law, Act of October 27, 1955, \u00a7 5(h)(1), as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(h)(1) (1964 and Supp.1977), in refusing Geraldine Cobb and her mother Martha as tenants in the Governours Palace Apartments. The Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the PHRC, and the majority sustains the decision of the Commonwealth Court. Today\u2019s second-guessing of the PHRC represents an unwarranted departure from the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard for reviewing factual determinations of administrative agencies, thus frustrating the important purposes of the PHRC. I dissent.\nSection 10 of the Human Relations Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 960, provides that judicial review of a PHRC order is governed by the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4,1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 44, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.44 (1962), which provides that a reviewing \u201ccourt shall affirm the adjudication [of the PHRC] unless it shall find that the same is in violation of constitutional rights of the appellant, or is not in accordance with law, ... or that any finding of fact made by the agency and necessary to support its adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined as such proof as would lead a reasonable person to believe that the agency\u2019s determination of fact is reasonable. Stillman Unemployment Compensation Case, 161 Pa.Super. 569, 56 A.2d 380 (1948); A. P. Weaver & Sons v. Sanitary Water Board, 3 Pa.Cmwlth. 499, 284 A.2d 515 (1971). Accord, Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). Professor Schwartz illustrates the substantial evidence standard:\n\u201cWhere a question of law is at issue, the court determines the rightness of the agency answer on its own independent judgment. If the agency answer does not square with that which the court considers the right one, its finding of law should not be upheld. Where a question of fact is at issue, the court determines only the reasonableness of the agency answer. If the agency answer is reasonable, even though it is not necessarily the one which the court would have given had it sat as the trier of fact, the agency finding of fact should be upheld. \u2018Findings of fact cannot and will not be set aside if the evidence in the record reasonably supports the administrative conclusion, even though suggested alternative conclusions may be equally or even more reasonable and persuasive.\u2019 The agency, not the court, is the trier of fact; and the review function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis, in the record considered as a whole, for the agency finding.\u201d\nB. Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 211 (1976) (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted). The substantial evidence standard allows the agency maximum flexibility to pursue its legislatively delegated responsibilities. A. P. Weaver & Sons v. Sanitary Water Board, supra; B. Schwartz, Administrative Law, supra.\nThe Commonwealth Court and the majority today have abandoned this first principle of administrative law. St. Andrews claimed it had a leasing policy requiring tenants to have weekly earnings equaling a month\u2019s rent and to provide supervision for young children on the premises. (R. 92a, 94a, 123a -124a). Evidence before the PHRC, however, supports the PHRC\u2019s conclusion that this \u201cpolicy\u201d was nothing more than a vehicle for discrimination. (R. 55a -56a).\nThe combined weekly income of Geraldine and Martha Cobb exceeded St. Andrew\u2019s income threshold, (R. 17a) yet St. Andrews asserted that, because neither of the Cobb\u2019s weekly income was alone sufficient, it denied the Cobb\u2019s rental application (92a-93a). The PHRC also heard testimony that persons in a financial condition similar to that of the Cobbs were not excluded as tenants on this basis. (R. 140a; see also R. 49a, 131a).\nFurther, the PHRC heard testimony that St. Andrews accepted applicants with children if the applicants made arrangements for supervision of the children. (R. 93a -94a). Martha Cobb had a six year old child who would have lived in the apartment building. (R. 16a). St. Andrews did not inform the Cobbs of either its policy against admitting tenants with unattended children or its exception to this policy. (R. 17a). St. Andrews thus denied the Cobbs an opportunity to make arrangements for the child. Based on all this evidence, the PHRC concluded that St. Andrews was discriminating.\n\u201c[T]he credibility of the witnesses, the weight of their testimony, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it are for the [agency. A court\u2019s] duty is performed by studying the testimony in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor [the agency] has found, giving that party the benefit of every inference which can be logically reasonably drawn from it. . . .\u201d Stillman Unemployment Case, supra, 161 Pa.Super. at 575, 56 A.2d at 383. While another tribunal in the first instance might have reached a conclusion different from that of the PHRC, this alone cannot justify interference with the agency\u2019s determination. Evidence in the record, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the PHRC\u2019s determination that St. Andrew\u2019s rental policy was a subterfuge used to discriminate, and the PHRC\u2019s determination of fact should therefore be upheld.\nIn reaching its conclusion contrary to that of the PHRC, the majority reweighs the evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, thus violating the established practice of this Court in administrative, e. g., Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n. v. Feeser, 469 Pa. 173, 364 A.2d 1324 (1976); Stillman Unemployment Case, supra, criminal, e. g., Commonwealth v. Brown, 473 Pa. 562, 375 A.2d 1260 (1977), orphans\u2019 court, e. g., In re Adoption of William L., 477 Pa. 322, 383 A.2d 1228 (1978); McCrea Estate, 475 Pa. 383, 380 A.2d 773 (1977); Cohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 284 A.2d 754 (1971), and civil matters, e. g., Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.2d 585 (1975); Reed v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 434 Pa. 212, 253 A.2d 101 (1969). \u201cConflicting evidence was presented but the resolution was for the trier of fact,\u201d Garges Estate, 474 Pa. 237, 243, 378 A.2d 307, 310 (1977), and not this Court. \u201cThe test is not whether we, the appellate court, would have reached the same result had we been acting as the hearing judge who saw and heard the witness[es], \u2018but rather whether a judicial mind, on due consideration of the evidence, as a whole, could reasonably have reached the conclusion of the [finder of fact].\u2019 \u201d Field v. Golden Triangle Broadcasting, Inc., 451 Pa. 410, 415, 305 A.2d 689, 692 (1973).\nThe Commonwealth Court also reversed that part of the PHRC\u2019s order requiring St. Andrews to pay the Cobbs damages for their injury resulting from St. Andrews\u2019 discriminatory practices. For the reasons set forth in the Opinion of the Court in Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n. v. Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Ass\u2019n., 453 Pa. 124, 306 A.2d 881 (1973), and my dissenting opinions in Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n. v. Zamantakis, 478 Pa. 454, 387 A.2d 70 (1978) and Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n. v. St. Joe Minerals Corp., 476 Pa. 302, 382 A.2d 731 (filed January 26, 1978) (Roberts, J., joined by Nix, J., dissenting), I believe the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the PHRC improperly awarded damages. Even on the majority\u2019s terms, the proceedings should be remanded to the PHRC for reconsideration of its order in light of today\u2019s decision.\nI dissent and would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the PHRC..\nNIX, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
