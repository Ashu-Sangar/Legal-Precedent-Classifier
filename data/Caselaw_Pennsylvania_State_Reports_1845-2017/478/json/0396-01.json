        "text": "OPINION\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nThe central question for decision in this case is whether the Delaware River Port Authority is immune from suit in trespass in the courts of this State. We hold that it is not.\nAppellant\u2019s husband died as a result of injuries sustained on August 16, 1972, while employed in the construction of the Admiral Barry Bridge from Chester, Pennsylvania, to Bridgeport, New Jersey. A wrongful death and survival action against the appellee Authority and other defendants was brought by the administratrix of Yancoskie\u2019s estate and oy his widow and child. Under the heading of new matter in its amended answer the Authority claimed that it was \u201ca public corporate agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania entitled to sovereign immunity\u201d and that it was therefore immune from suit. The Authority\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted by the court, and the Superior Court affirmed. 235 Pa.Super. 263, 340 A.2d 533 (1975). The case is here upon our allowance of an appeal. 235 Pa.Super. xli.\nThe courts below, in upholding the Authority\u2019s claim of immunity, did not have the benefit of our decision in Specter v. Commonwealth, 462 Pa. 474, 341 A.2d 481 (1975). In Specter, it was held that an answer to the question of whether the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission was immune from suit depended upon whether the Commission was \u201cpart of the Commonwealth.\u201d 462 Pa. at 478, 341 A.2d 481. This issue in turn required \u201ca scrutiny of [the entity\u2019s] status in the governmental framework of Pennsylvania\u201d that focused on its \u201cnature . . . and its relationship to other statewide governmental bodies.\u201d Id. 462 Pa. at 479, 341 A.2d at 483. We believe that an analysis of the legislative acts defining the purposes and powers of the Delaware River Port Authority, together with the relevant judicial decisions, requires a conclusion that, like the Turnpike Commission in Specter, the Authority is not \u201can integral part of the Commonwealth,\u201d id. 462 Pa. at 483, 341 A.2d at 486, and that it is therefore subject to suit, as are \u201cpolitical subdivisions or governmental entities other than the Commonwealth itself.\u201d Id. 462 Pa. at 478, 341 A.2d at 482. See Ayala v. Philadelphia Bd. of Educ., 453 Pa. 584, 305 A.2d 877 (1973).\nIn considering the Authority\u2019s statutory status some historical background is useful. Pennsylvania\u2019s recent involvement in the spanning of the lower Delaware River begins with the Act of July 9, 1919, P.L. 814, as amended, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3421 et scq. (1961). Under this statute, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia undertook to provide one half of the cost of construction of what is now known as the Benjamin Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia to Camden. Id. \u00a7 1, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3421. A group known as the Pennsylvania Commission, consisting of four governmental and four non-governmental members, was created to supervise (in conjunction with a similar commission created by the State of New Jersey) the design, construction, and operation of the planned bridge. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 4 6, 10, 11, 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3424-3426, 3430, 3431.\nAlthough the Pennsylvania Commission was granted extensive powers, including that of eminent domain, id. \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3425, 3426, the General Assembly added important limitations. The enabling statute specifically provided:\n\u201cthe . . . commission shall not proceed .to exercise or carry out any authority or power herein or hereby given it to bind the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania beyond the extent to which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall have appropriated or made available to said . commission the moneys hereinbefore stipulated as the share of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3424.\nIn addition, the appropriations to the Pennsylvania Commission were not grants but loans. The tolls agreed upon by the Pennsylvania Commission and its counterpart in New Jersey were to be collected at least \u201cuntil such time as the State of New Jersey, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia shall each have been fully reimbursed for all moneys expended to pay the cost of said bridge and the approaches thereto,\u201d with interest on such moneys to run at four per cent per annum. Id. \u00a7 10(a), 36 P.S. \u00a7 3430(a). Finally, it was intended that the Pennsylvania Commission was to have a limited life; upon reimbursement in full to the governments that provided the funding, the bridge was to be turned over to local authorities. Id. \u00a7 11, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3431. See also Act of July 13,1923, P.L. 1093, \u00a7 9, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3459 (1961).\nBy 1931, more ambitious plans for interstate cooperation in the economic development of the lower Delaware Valley required extensive statutory change. Accordingly, Pennsylvania and New Jersey created, by means of an interstate compact, a successor to the previously existing interstate body. That successor is now known as the Delaware River Port Authority, the appellee herein. Its purpose was expanded from the operation of a single interstate bridge to embrace the development and improvement of the lower Delaware port district from Philadelphia south to the Delaware border. In addition to its power to operate and maintain the bridges across the Delaware River from Philadelphia south to the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Arts. 1(a), XII-A(l), XII-B(l), the Authority is charged with the development and improvement of port facilities in this area. Id. Art. 1(c), (k).\nThe powers granted the Authority by the compact are commensurate with its broad purposes. The Authority is designated as a \u201cpublic corporate instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey . . . exercising an essential governmental function .\u201d Id. Art. I. As such, it is granted power: to acquire, hold, use and sell real and personal property (id. Art. IV(g)-(h)); \u201cto exercise the right of eminent domain\u201d (id. Art. IV(k); see also id. Art. XII -B(3) (a)); to enter iffto contracts (id. Art. IV(f)); and to employ \u201ccounsel and such other officers, and such agents and employes, as it may require for the performance of its duties . . . and [to] fix and determine their qualifications, duties and compensation\u201d (id. Art. IV(e)).\nThe powers granted to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission are similar in nature. See Specter, supra, 462 Pa. at 479-80, 341 A.2d 481. The Authority\u2019s implied powers, however, are considerably broader than those of the Commission. Unlike the Turnpike Commission, the Authority is permitted\n\u201c. . . generally to exercise, in connection with its property and affairs and in connection with property within its control, any and all powers which might be exercised by a natural person or a private corporation in connection with similar property and affairs.\u201d 36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Art. IV(n).\nThe Authority differs from the Turnpike Commission in another important respect. Although it is contemplated that when all the Commission\u2019s financial obligations are paid or provided for the Commission will be dissolved and its assets vested in the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Transportation, which will then operate the Turnpike system, the Authority is granted \u201cperpetual succession.\u201d 36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Art. IV(a).\nIn one critical particular, however, the Commission and the Authority possess precisely the same status, viz., both are financially independent of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Authority, like the Commission, raises revenue by means of bonds and satisfies these obligations by toll and other user charges. Moreover, and again like the Commission, the Authority\u2019s debts are not Commonwealth obligations. Article VII of the compact provides in full:\n\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of this agreement, the commission shall have no power to pledge the credit of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the credit of the State of New Jersey, or the credit of any county, city, borough, village, township or other municipality of said Commonwealth or said State, or to create any debt of said Commonwealth or of said State or of such municipality.\u201d\nThe interstate compact in question does not give an explicit answer to the question whether the Authority is an \u201cintegral part of the Commonwealth,\u201d Specter, supra, 462 Pa. at 483, 341 A.2d 481, but the structure of the authority strongly indicates that it is not. The Authority is declared to be a \u201cpublic corporate instrumentality,\u201d and it is vested with the powers usually granted to a corporation operated for profit, e.g., perpetual succession. Although the Authority does possess the governmental power of eminent domain, it lacks an essential attribute of a true governmental body, the taxing power. 36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Art. IV(n). Moreover, there is no close connection, such as that between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Turnpike Commission, between the Authority and Commonwealth agencies, and the financially separate status of the Authority is expressly provided. In sum, as this Court observed some forty years ago, the compact agreed upon by Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1931 had the effect of \u201crelinquishing the control theretofore exercised severally by the two states [over the predecessor commissions\u2019 property] and in turning the property over to [a] two-state corporation .\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Clark, 331 Pa. 405, 414-15, 200 A. 41, 46 (1938) (dictum).\nRemaining for consideration are the judicial decisions in which the status of the Authority has been in issue.\nIn the Delaware River Joint Comm\u2019n Case, 342 Pa. 119, 19 A.2d 278 (1941), this Court stated that the Authority\u2019s predecessor in name \u201cacts as the agent of the Commonwealth,\u201d id. 342 Pa. at 122, 19 A.2d at 279, and that it was therefore not required to reimburse a telephone company for the cost of relocating certain lines. The Court had no occasion, however, to discuss the precise nature of the agency, and it was sufficient to observe that the grant of a franchise to the public utility in that case \u201cwas expressly subjected to municipal regulation . . . .\u201d Id.\nA comprehensive discussion of the Authority\u2019s status came one year later in Souder v. Philadelphia Police Pension Fund, 344 Pa. 286, 25 A.2d 191 (1942). In that case, payments from a pension fund were discontinued after plaintiff\u2019s decedent had gone to work for the Authority\u2019s predecessor in name; the Fund relied on a provision of its by-law's authorizing suspension of payment if a beneficiary should \u201center the service of the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d This Court held that employment with the Authority did not constitute entering \u201cthe service of the State\u201d and thus did not permit the suspension of benefits. In an opinion by Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Drew, we said:\n\u201cBy directing the Governor to enter into this compact the legislature clearly indicated its intention to abandon the previous dependent administrative agency known as the \u2018Pennsylvania commission\u2019, and to establish in its stead the \u2018Delaware River Joint Commission\u2019 [i.e., the Authority] as a special public corporation. Upon the execution of the agreement on July 1, 1931, the Commission became a distinct entity, separate and apart from either State. .\n\u201cIts obligations were payable solely from its own revenues raised by it through the sale of its bonds and the collection of tolls. Its employees were not those of this Commonwealth or of the State of New Jersey, but of this public corporation, which hired them and paid their salaries.\n\u201cWhile the Delaware River Joint Commission acts as the agent of the Commonwealth (Delaware River Joint Commission Case, 342 Pa. 119, 122, 19 A.2d 278), yet it is indeed similar in structure to the various Municipal Authorities authorized by statute to be created throughout the State. They are public corporations, being corporate agencies engaged in the administration of civil government.\u201d Id. 344 Pa. at 291 92, 25 A.2d at 194. (citations omitted).\nThe Authority\u2019s status as a \u201cspecial public corporation\u201d remained intact for some twenty years. But in Anderson Appeal, 408 Pa. 179, 182 A.2d 514 (1962), the Court rejected what had been settled law in a decision that may fairly be characterized as the high-water mark of immunity for governmental and quasi-governmental bodies in Pennsylvania. Holding that the Authority \u201cwas intended to be and has always been an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania carrying out an executive function,\u201d id. 408 Pa. at 182, 182 A.2d at 515, the Court rejected a claim that the Authority was liable for consequential damages due to the activities of the Authority in construction of the Walt Whitman Bridge across the Delaware. In disavowing the analysis used in Souder, the Court relied on cases such as Delaware River Joint Comm\u2019n Case, supra. For the reasons noted above, however, that case in no way required a finding of immunity. Also cited by the Anderson court was Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Comm\u2019n v. Carver, 399 Pa. 545, 160 A.2d 425 (1960). But that case, which held that a commissioner of an entity quite similar in structure to the appellee Authority was a public officer, accepted the conclusion of a prior case that that commission \u201cis a separate corporate entity and not the alter ego of the Commonwealth. While it is the \u2018instrumentality\u2019 and \u2018agent\u2019 of the Commonwealth, it is not the Commonwealth.\u201d Carver v. Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Comm\u2019n, 70 Dauph. 114, 116 (1957). Further reliance was placed in Anderson on a series of cases involving the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, culminating in Rader v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm\u2019n, 407 Pa. 609, 182 A.2d 199 (1962). For the reasons noted in Specter, supra, 462 Pa. at 485 93, 341 A.2d 481, however, such cases are no longer controlling on the question of immunity.\nWe are of the opinion that Anderson, like Rader before it, can no longer be regarded as authoritative on the question of immunity; the bases for the conclusion in Anderson were either unconvincing at the time or have since been rejected. In light of the structure of the Authority under the interstate compact, and the better reasoned decisions, we conclude that the Authority, as a public corporation that cannot be said \u2022 to be an \u201cintegral part of the Commonwealth,\u201d cannot claim immunity from suit in trespass.\nThe order of the Superior Court is vacated and the cause remanded to the court of common pleas with a procedendo.\nROBERTS, NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., concur in the result.\nEAGEN, C. J., and O\u2019BRIEN, J., dissent.\n. Appellee contends that its claim of immunity has been admitted by appellant\u2019s failure to answer this assertion of immunity in the Authority\u2019s amended new matter. This argument is without merit. Enoch v. Food Fair Stores, Inc., 232 Pa.Super. 1, 4 5, 331 A.2d 912 (1974).\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp. 1977 -78).\nA parallel action to the one here involved was brought in federal, district court, but was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for want of subject matter jurisdiction in the district court. Yancoskie v. Delaware River Port Authority, 528 F.2d 722 (3d Cir. 1975), rev\u2019g 385 F.Supp. 1170 (D.N.J.1974). See Louisville & N.R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908); Gulley v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); Phillips Petrol. Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 415 U.S. 125, 94 S.Ct. 1002, 39 L.Ed.2d 209 (1974). See generally Mishkin, The Federal \"Question\u201d in the District Courts, 53 COLUM.L. REV. 157 (1953).

Art. VI(a), (c). See also Act of July 9, 1919, P.L. 814, \u00a7 10(a), as amended, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3430 (1961), discussed supra.\n. See also Act of June 19, 1968, P.L. 226, No. 108, \u00a7 6, 36 P.S. \u00a7 3510.6 (Supp. 1977-78). For a similar provision affecting the Turnpike Commission, see the Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 774, No. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, as amended, 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 652b, 652f (1961 & Supp. 1977-78).\n. Appellee argues that certain provisions of the compact require a conclusion that the Authority is an integral part of the Commonwealth. This is said to be the case because six of the eight Pennsylvania members of the Authority are appointed by the Governor (with the Auditor General and the State Treasurer filling the two remaining seats); because the Authority is required to submit annual reports to the legislatures of both states; and because new projects (with certain exceptions) must be approved by the legislatures of both states, and in some cases by the governors thereof.\nWe find these contentions unpersuasive. It should be noted that the members of the Turnpike Commission are also appointed by the Governor and, unlike his appointees to the Authority, must be confirmed by the Senate. Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 774, No. 211, \u00a7 4, as amended, 36 P.S. \u00a7 652d (Supp. 1977-78). In addition, there is nothing in the requirement that a public corporation submit reports to the legislatures of the compacting states that serves to make that corporation an integral part of either state, or of both. Finally, the requirement that legislative authorization be given for new projects (36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Arts. XII, XII -A, XII B), is not dissimilar to the statutory authorizations for the various extensions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike System. See Specter, supra, 462 Pa., at 482 n.6, 341 A.2d 481.\n. At the time Anderson was decided, \u201cmunicipal and other corporations\u201d were liable to owners of property that was taken or \u201cinjured.\u201d Pa.Const, of 1874, art. XVI, \u00a7 8. See also Pa.Const, art. X, \u00a7 4. The Commonwealth, however, was not liable for any injury to property in the absence of an actual taking. E.g., McGarrity v. Commonwealth, 311 Pa. 436, 439, 166 A. 895 (1933), appeal dismissed, 292 U.S. 19, 54 S.Ct. 565, 78 L.Ed. 1095 (1934). Liability for certain consequential damages is now imposed on the Commonwealth by the Eminent Domain Code, Act of June 22, 1964, Spec. Sess., P.L. 84, art. VI, \u00a7 612, 26 P.S. 1 612 (Supp. 1977 -78).\n. As in Specter, supra, 462 Pa. at 493 n.18, 341 A.2d 481, there is no need for us to consider whether the interstate compact\u2019s provision that the Authority may \u201csue and be sued,\u201d 36 P.S. \u00a7 3503, Art. IV(b), operates as a waiver of immunity as a matter of Pennsylvania law.",
