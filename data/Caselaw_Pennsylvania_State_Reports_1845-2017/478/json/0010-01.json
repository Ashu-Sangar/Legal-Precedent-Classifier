The conviction of murder of the second degree was directly appealed to this Court.\nThe single issue raised in this appeal is that appellant was denied a fair trial because the prosecuting attorney used his peremptory challenges to exclude Blacks from the jury. We need not reach the merits of this argument since appellant has waived this issue. See Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1123.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nOur jurisdiction in this case is based on Section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1977-78).",
