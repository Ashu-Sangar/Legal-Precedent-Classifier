        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nOn April 21, 1975, appellant, Drew Kelly Colbert, was arrested in Philadelphia. Appellant\u2019s arrest was premised on his alleged participation in the homicide of Clinton Dunn, Jr., of Aiken County, South Carolina. See \u00a7 13 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1941, P.L. 288, \u00a7 1, et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 191.1, et seq. Appellant was preliminarily arraigned and a \u201cthirty day\u201d hearing, as required by \u00a7 15 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, supra, was scheduled for May 19, 1975. Appellant was ordered detained in the Philadelphia Detention Center. On April 30, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a petition to transfer appellant to Pennypack House, a juvenile facility, in light of appellant\u2019s age \u2014 seventeen.\nOn May 8, 1975, defense counsel filed a petition to transfer the case to the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. On May 13, the petition to transfer to Pennypack House was granted, but the petition to transfer to the Family Division was denied. On May 19, pursuant to \u00a7 15 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, appellant appeared in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia; however, no Governor\u2019s Warrant had been received and, therefore, a thirty-day continuance was granted on June 18, 1975. Appellant again appeared in court and a second thirty-day continuance was granted.\nOn June 26, 1975, appellant filed a \u201cpetition to dismiss\u201d. The bases of dismissal were:\n1. Lack of probable cause for his arrest.\n2. Failure to comply with \u00a7 15 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.\n3. The complaint for extradition was defective.\nOn July 14, 1975, the above \u201cmotion\u201d was dismissed. On July 18,1975, appellant was \u201carrested\u201d pursuant to a Governor\u2019s Warrant from the State of South Carolina. On July 30, 1975, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On September 16, 1975, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied and appellant was ordered extradited to South Carolina. On September 17, 1975, appellant appealed the extradition to the Superior Court, and also filed a petition for supersedeas. On October 3, 1975, Superi- or Court granted appellant\u2019s petition for supersedeas, pending disposition of his appeal. On November 22, 1976, the Superior Court affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, which ordered extradition. On March 29, 1977, this court granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellant argues that the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that the demand for extradition and supporting documents from the demanding state demonstrates the existence of probable cause to believe that the alleged fugitive committed the crime charged. He contends that the absence of \u201cprobable cause\u201d would render an arrest in the asylum state on a Pennsylvania Governor\u2019s Warrant illegal. We do not agree.\nIn Com. ex rel. Marshall v. Gedney, 478 Pa. 299, 386 A.2d 942 (1978), a companion case to the instant appeal, we determined that an \u201cextradition arrest\u201d made on the authority of a governor\u2019s warrant from the asylum state must be based on probable cause. We continued our analysis in Marshall, and held that probable cause for an \u201cextradition arrest\u201d existed, wherein we stated:\n\u201cFor an \u2018extradition arrest,\u2019 however, we believe that \u2018probable cause\u2019 exists when the facts available at the time of the initial apprehension in the asylum state which would justify a reasonable man of caution to believe that the individual was the probable person charged with a crime in the demanding state and that state has complied with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.\u201d\nOur review of the record reveals that all of the statutory requirements exist:\n1. An allegation that Drew Kelly Colbert was in South Carolina at the time of the alleged homicide.\n2. A copy of the arrest warrant issued on January 9, 1975, by Lester L. Chitty, Magistrate in Aiken County, South Carolina, accompanied by an affidavit by E. H. Boyd, an investigator in the Aiken County Sheriff\u2019s office, sworn to before Magistrate Chitty. The warrant charges appellant with the homicide of Clinton Dunn, Jr.\n3. The authentication of the charge by the governor of the State of South Carolina.\nFinding the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act to have been met, we are of the opinion that \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed for the Pennsylvania \u201cextradition arrest\u201d.\nOrder of the Superior Court affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., files a concurring opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J., and NIX, J., join.\nPOMEROY, J., concurs in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 17 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act provides:\n\u201cIf the accused is not arrested under warrant of the Governor by the expiration of the time specified in the warrant or bond, a judge or magistrate may discharge him or may recommit him for a further period, not to exceed sixty days, or a judge or magistrate may again take bail for his appearance and surrender, as provided in section 16, but within a period not to exceed sixty days after the date of such new bond. . . . \u201d",

The evidence in the record is sufficient to establish such probable cause. Thus regardless whether relator\u2019s constitutional argument or his proposed constitutionally limited interpretation of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1941, P.L. 288, \u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 191.1 et seq., is correct, he is not entitled to relief.
