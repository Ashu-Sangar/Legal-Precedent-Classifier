J, and NIX and MANDERINO, JJ, would reverse the Judgment of Sentence believing the corpus delicti has not been established.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Robert C. Tall\u00f3n, was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter and robbery. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of five to ten years for each offense. A direct appeal from the voluntary manslaughter judgment of sentence was filed in this court. The judgment of sentence on the robbery conviction was appealed to the Superior Court, which certified that appeal to this court.\nThe facts are as follows. On July 3,1973, the decomposed body of Daniel Sebolt was discovered on the floor of his apartment. Blood stains were on the pillowcase and the victim\u2019s eyeglasses and false teeth were found in the bed sheets. Both the victim\u2019s wallet and change purse were missing. The state of the body\u2019s decomposition indicated that the victim had been dead for a week, but an autopsy did not reveal the manner or cause of death.\nAt the time the body was discovered, appellant was incarcerated in Akron, Ohio on unrelated charges. He sent a letter to the Sheriff of Mifflin County, site of this homicide, which led to an investigation culminating in appellant\u2019s arrest. He gave two confessions, one while in the Akron jail and one after returning to Mifflin County. In both confessions he stated that he and the victim were arguing when appellant began choking the victim. Appellant told police he then took the victim\u2019s wallet. When he discovered that the wallet contained no money, he threw it into the river.\nAppellant first claims that the trial court erred in admitting his confession because the Commonwealth had failed to first establish the corpus delicti of the crimes for which he was charged. We do not agree.\nOur corpus delicti rule1 was first set forth in Gray v. Commonwealth, 101 Pa. 380, 386 (1882), where we stated:\n\u201c. . . when the commonwealth had given sufficient evidence of the corpus delicti to entitle the case to go to the jury, it is competent to show a confession made by the prisoner connecting him with the crime. Under such circumstances the jury should first pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence of the corpus delicti. If it satisfies them beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime has been committed, then they are at liberty to give the confession such weight as it is entitled to, taking into view the circumstances surrounding it, and the extent to which it has been corroborated.\u201d\nMore recently, we stated in Commonwealth v. Ware, 459 Pa. 334, 365, 329 A.2d 258, 274 (1974):\n\u201cWe have followed Professor Wigmore\u2019s analysis that a crime conceptually consists of three elements: \u2018first, the occurrence of the specific kind of injury or loss . . .; secondly, somebody\u2019s criminality (in contrast, e. g., to accident) as the source of the loss, \u2014 these two together involving the commission of a crime by somebody; and, thirdly, the accused\u2019s identity as the doer of this crime.\u2019 7 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2072, at 401 (3d ed. 1940) (emphasis removed); see Commonwealth v. May, 451 Pa. 31, 32, 301 A.2d 368, 369 (1973). Corpus delicti, meaning \u2018body of the crime,\u2019 consists of the first two elements. Commonwealth v. May, supra; Commonwealth v. Rhoads, 225 Pa.Super. 208, 213, 310 A.2d 406, 409 (1973). Specifically, \u2018 \u201c[t]he corpus delicti [in a murder prosecution] consists of proof that a human being is dead and that such death took place under circumstances which indicate criminal means or the commission of a felonious act.\u201d \u2019 Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 317, 300 A.2d 78, 82 (1973), quoting Commonwealth v. Frazier, 411 Pa. 195, 202, 191 A.2d 369, 373 (1963).\u201d\nWe further stated in Ware :\n\u201cWe do not lose sight of the distinction between the requirement of corroboration of the statements of the accused and the Commonwealth\u2019s ultimate burden of proof. The former merely requires that the trial court be satisfied that a conviction will not result from a confession or admission when no crime has in fact been committed by anyone. Ultimately the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has in fact been committed.\u201d Id., 459 Pa. at 367, 329 A.2d, at 275 (n. 43).\nWe must then determine if independent evidence for the crimes of murder and robbery existed to allow the introduction of appellant\u2019s confession.\nAs previously stated, the corpus delicti in a murder prosecution consists of proof that an individual is dead and that death resulted from criminal means. Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 300 A.2d 78 (1973). As we stated in Commonwealth v. Frazier, 411 Pa. 195, 202, 191 A.2d 369, 373 (1963):\n. . Like other facts, [the corpus delicti] may be established by circumstantial evidence . . . . The corpus delicti is sufficiently established if the circumstances of the death are consistent with crime, even though they may also be consistent with [other causes of death] . . It is not necessary to show by affirmative proof that the possibility of [those other causes] does not exist . .\u201d (citations omitted.)\nIn this case, appellant claims that the victim\u2019s death may well have been a result of natural causes. We believe, however that the blood on the pillow, along with the evidence that the victim\u2019s glasses and dentures were tangled in the bedsheets, and the fact that the victim\u2019s wallet and change purse were missing, offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove the corpus delicti of murder.\nThe same is true of the robbery charge. The Crimes Code provides:\n\u201c(1) A person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he:\n\u201c(i) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another;\n\u201c(ii) threatens another with or intentionally puts him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury; or\n(iii) commits or threatens immediately to commit any felony of the first or second degree.\n\u201c(2) An act shall be deemed \u2018in the course of committing a theft\u2019 if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in flight after the attempt or commission.\u201d Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.P.S.A. \u00a7 3701. (Emphasis added.)\nTo establish the corpus delicti of robbery, the Commonwealth must show an injury (theft or attempted theft) by criminal means (by the infliction of serious bodily injury). Again, we believe the Commonwealth has met its burden, as testimony indicates that the victim always had a change purse in his possession. Yet, when the body was discovered, neither a change purse nor a wallet was found. The requirement of serious bodily injury is self-evident because the victim was dead. The Commonwealth offered sufficient evidence for the robbery charge to allow appellant\u2019s confession to be admitted.\nIn the same vein, appellant argues that the corpus delicti was not established because a Dr. Thomas Magnani was unable to assign a cause of death. In Commonwealth v. Ilgenfritz, 466 Pa. 345, 351, 353 A.2d 387, 390 (1976), we stated:\n\u201c. . . We have held that \u2018it is not fatal that the Commonwealth cannot establish by direct evidence that the blows causing the fatal injury were inflicted by human agency. \u201cAdmittedly, there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged beating; but the Commonwealth need not provide its case directly. Circumstantial evidence can be as reliable and persuasive as eyewitness testimony.\u201d \u2019 Commonwealth v. Blevins, 453 Pa. 481, 486, 309 A.2d 421 (1973).\u201d\nWe believe that the circumstantial evidence surrounding this death is of a sufficient nature to permit an inference that death was by criminal human agency.\nAppellant next argues that the court erred in charging the jury on what evidence could be considered in determining the corpus delicti of the crimes charged. It is the rule in this Commonwealth that before a jury can consider a defendant\u2019s confession, it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the corpus delicti has been established. Commonwealth v. May, 451 Pa. 31, 301 A.2d 368 (1973) (n. 2). Our review of the trial court\u2019s charge reveals that the court did define the corpus delicti rule and therefore we are satisfied that the charge was proper and appellant\u2019s contention is meritless.\nAppellant next argues that the court erred in permitting a hypothetical question. When Dr. Magnani was on the stand, he was asked whether \u201cit is possible to strangle a person without doing any damage to any of the neck bones or other bones located within the neck?\u201d Dr. Magnani replied, \u201cYes, it is possible.\u201d Because of the use of the word possible, appellant believes the question was improper, citing Sweeney v. Blue Anchor Bev. Co., 325 Pa. 216, 222, 189 A. 331, 334 (1937), where we stated:\n\u201c. . .No matter how skilled or experienced the witness may be, he will not be permitted to guess or to state a judgment based on mere conjecture.\u201d\nWe believe, however, that the rule in Sweeney is inapposite, because Dr. Magnani gave an affirmative response to a question which did not require conjecture on his part; rather, Dr. Magnani\u2019s expertise allowed him to answer the proffered question.\nAppellant next complains about various alleged prejudicial comments by the prosecutor which appellant believes entitle him to a new trial. During the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks, he mentioned the letter which appellant had sent to the Mifflin County sheriff. Because a confession is inadmissible until the corpus delicti is proven by independent evidence, appellant believes the prosecutor\u2019s remark was in error. However, at the time the remark was made, the district attorney did not mention the contents of the letter, and did not allude to any facts that indicated the letter was inculpatory. Further, the letter was eventually admitted into evidence; thus, appellant\u2019s argument is merit-less. See Commonwealth v. Russell, 459 Pa. 1, 326 A.2d 303 (1974). See ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function, \u00a7 5.5. (approved draft 1971).\nAppellant next complains about the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the discovery of the victim\u2019s body. The district attorney told the jury of blood on the pillowcase and the terrible odor from the decomposed body. While the imagery was not the most pleasant, the prosecutor only told the jury what his witnesses testified to. This contention is also without merit. See Russell, supra.\nAt another point, the district attorney referred to \u201cthe scene of the crime\u201d before the corpus delicti had been established. The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection, but refused his motion for a mistrial. We agree with the trial court that the remark was not of such a prejudicial nature as to require a mistrial. Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 301 A.2d 673 (1973).\nAppellant next argues the court below erred in not granting a mistrial when the district attorney asked questions of the police officer who went to Akron to question appellant. The witness was asked what he expected to discover from questioning appellant. Appellant objected to the question and the trial court sustained his objection, thereby granting all the relief requested by appellant. Appellant failed to move for a mistrial; therefore, he cannot now complain that the court erred in failing to grant a mistrial when no such motion was made. Commonwealth v. Glenn, 459 Pa. 545, 330 A.2d 535 (1974). Moreover, we do not believe that the question was of such a nature that would warrant a sua sponte declaration of a mistrial by the trial court. Cf. Commonwealth v. Stewart, 456 Pa. 447, 317 A.2d 616 (1974).\nAppellant next complains about alleged improper questions asked of two proposed jurors during voir dire. As neither juror was seated, we can find no prejudice to appellant. Compare Commonwealth v. Jones, 447 Pa. 594, 385 A.2d 946 (1978).\nVarious witnesses testified that the victim always carried a leather change purse. One witness testified that the last time she saw the victim, about a month prior to his death, he still had the change purse in his possession. Appellant claims this testimony concerning the decedent\u2019s possession of a change purse was too remote, thus requiring a new trial. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Ross, 266 Pa. 580, 110 A. 327 (1920), we held that in many instances, remoteness of evidence goes to its weight, and not its admissibility. In some instances we have held evidence too remote to be admissible, Commonwealth v. Knight, 469 Pa. 57, 364 A.2d 902 (1976). We decline to do so in the instant case. Evidence that victim always carried a change purse and, in fact, still had it a month before his death is sufficiently probative to allow its admission..\nAppellant argues that his convictions cannot stand because the verdict of voluntary manslaughter and robbery are inconsistent under the facts of this case. Since the case was being tried on a felony-murder theory, appellant believes the verdicts are inconsistent, entitling him to a new trial. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Strand, 464 Pa. 544, 547, 347 A.2d 675, 676 (1975):\n\u201cBut even if it were assumed that the two verdicts were logically inconsistent, such inconsistency alone could not be grounds for a new trial or for reversal. \u2018It has long been the rule in Pennsylvania and in the federal courts that consistency in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Parrotto, 189 Pa.Super. 415, 419, 150 A.2d 396 (1957).\nAppellant\u2019s contention is without merit.\nAppellant finally complains that the trial court erred in excluding the coroner\u2019s death certificate, which attributed the victim\u2019s death to natural causes. However, he never raised this issue at either trial or post-verdict motions. He is thus precluded from first raising an issue on appeal, and the failure to raise it at the earlier stages constitutes a waiver. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975); Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nI would affirm the Judgments of sentence.\nROBERTS and POMEROY, J., join in this opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., and NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., would reverse the judgment of sentence believing the corpus delicti has not been established.",
