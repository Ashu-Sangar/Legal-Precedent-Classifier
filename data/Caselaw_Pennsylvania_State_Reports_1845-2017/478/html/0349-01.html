The two women returned home at approximately 8:00 j&gt;. m., at which time appellant repeated what he had previously said concerning Christine’s injuries, and reported that he had put Christine to bed.

She also testified that Christine did not appear to be in any pain at the time she put the dress on her, and that she appeared normal other than that she was a little sleepy because she had not taken a nap earlier.</p>

The prosecution’s evidence fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt, however, that the injuries to the decedent’s abdomen, with their resultant damage to the internal organs, were sustained during the time she was under appellant’s exclusive control. Neither of the prosecution’s expert medical witnesses was able to testify as to whether or not all injuries were inflicted at the same time.

Furthermore, as previously noted, the prosecution’s evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the blows to the child’s abdomen were delivered within the four hour time period during which the child was under appellant’s exclusive control. Although the decedent’s mother testified for the prosecution that she observed no unusual marks on the child’s body other than those previously described at the time the child was left in appellant’s custody, she also testified that she noticed nothing abnormal other than the facial bruises, upon her return. There is thus no evidence to show that the abdominal injuries were sustained prior to the child’s mother’s return at 8:00 p. m. From that time (at which time the prosecution’s witness testified that the child appeared to be sleeping normally) until 8:00 a. m. the following morning when the child was discovered lying lifeless on the floor beside her bed, appellant did not exercise exclusive custody over her and therefore <em>Paquette </em>is inapplicable.
