She testified that with the living room already aflame, the decedent followed her down the stairs and into the kitchen, but when she reached the gate in the back yard, she turned around to discover that her husband had not continued out of the house. She returned inside and called for her husband, at which point he hollered down from the second floor, “I’m going to put my clothes on.” His return upstairs proved fatal; rescuers discovered him there, dead from smoke inhalation and thermal burns of the body surface.</p>

The majority continues to insist that trial judges give juries the option of finding a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter (provocation and passion) in all murder cases, even though there is no evidence of manslaughter. In the present case, there was only evidence of murder in the second degree (felony murder), but the majority states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b156-9" data-blocks='[["BL_156.10",156,[280,1479,1105,304]]]'>“The jury could have returned, pursuant to its mercy dispensing power or its awareness of extenuating circumstances, verdicts of either voluntary manslaughter or murder of the third degree even if it found appellant guilty of arson, and found that the arson caused the victim’s death.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b156-10" data-blocks='[["BL_156.11",156,[237,1815,1149,581]],["BL_157.1",157,[214,296,1146,417]]]'>In effect, the majority is requiring a judge to tell a jury that not only does two plus two equal four, but it can, if the jury wishes, equal five. We instruct our juries to render a true and correct verdict based on the law (which should emanate from the facts) and facts presented at trial and neither sympathy nor passion is to influence them. Juries for centuries have been instructed, no matter how agonizing, to reach a <em>true </em>verdict. Juries are the guardians of truth. The majority wants juries to be able to render verdicts based on law which has nothing to do with the case so that the jury may, contrary to the facts, dispense “mercy”. Mer<a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>cy is not the function of a jury — truth is. We have enough “mercy giving” entities: a sentencing judge, the parole board, the governor, etc. Now the majority would have a jury leave the realm of truth and become enmeshed in the world of social engineering. This perverts one of the foundations of our democracy, i. e. the jury system. Any confusion by the jury in this case was due to this perversion. I, therefore, dissent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
