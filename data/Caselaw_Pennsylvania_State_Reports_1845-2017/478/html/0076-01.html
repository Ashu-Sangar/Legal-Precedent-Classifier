The charges arose out of the fatal stabbing of Dr. Oliver Wilson. Prison sentences were imposed, and on direct appeal we affirmed the judgments. <em>Commonwealth v.

(1965) 1580, 19 P.S. § 1180-1 <em>et seq. </em>[Hereinafter: PCHA]. After a counseled evidentiary hearing, relief was denied. This appeal is from that order.</p>

At both stages, he was represented by the same counsel. Different court-appointed counsel, however, represented Smith at his PCHA hearing, after which the Court of Common Pleas held that Smith’s trial and appellate counsel were competent and effective. In this appeal, in which he is represented by still another court-appointed counsel, Smith raises the ineffectiveness of counsel at three stages: trial, appellate and post-conviction.</p>

First, he asserts trial counsel should have repolled the jury or clarified the record when there was confusion as to the jury’s finding of the degree of guilt on the homicide bill. Next, Smith argues counsel, in post-verdict motions and on direct appeal, should have assigned as error the trial court’s overruling of his objection to the assistant district attorney’s closing argument to the jury. Finally, Smith argues post-conviction <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>relief counsel should have obtained the testimony of Smith’s original trial counsel and should have presented Smith’s pro se post-conviction petition claims to the court in a “legally meaningful way.”</p>
