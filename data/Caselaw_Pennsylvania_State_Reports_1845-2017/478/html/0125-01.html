Appellant, United States Tobacco Company, is a New Jersey Corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. Its products are sold exclusively in interstate commerce, in part to Pennsylvania customers. For the time period in question, appellant had no manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, no warehouses or other structures in which inventory was stored, no offices in this state, maintained no bank accounts nor kept any corporate records, and held no corporate meetings in Pennsylvania.</p>

Orders obtained are sent to Greenwich, Connecticut for approval or rejection, and if approved, are filled by shipment from a point outside Pennsylvania. The representatives do not have the authority to accept an order, have no agency powers whatsoever, and no authority to adjust or settle claims, collect accounts receivable, or otherwise handle any money belonging to or due appellant.</p>

These samples are purchased from wholesalers in Pennsylvania at the wholesale price. If a retailer agrees to purchase those samples, the retailer pays the representative the same price. Hence, no profit is realized on these incidental sales. Representatives also check the retailer’s existing inventory of appellant’s tobacco products to determine if the products are fresh and attractively displayed. The representatives set up counter displays and sometimes give the retailers free samples of appellant’s products in exchange for more extensive counter space. The representatives maintain daily reports of their activities.</p>

Brady, </em><a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">430 U.S. 274</a>, <a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">97 S.Ct. 1076</a>, <a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">51 L.Ed.2d 326</a> (1977). The Commerce Clause, however, by its own force, places some limitation on a state’s power to exact taxes from interstate concerns. A tax will be held valid only if the state exacts a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation. <em>E. g., Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, </em><a href="/us/421/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="421 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="541095" data-case-paths="/us/421/0100-01">421 U.S. 100</a>, <a href="/us/421/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="421 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="541095" data-case-paths="/us/421/0100-01">95 S.Ct. 1538</a>, <a href="/us/421/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="421 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="541095" data-case-paths="/us/421/0100-01">44 L.Ed.2d 1</a> (1975). State taxes which affect interstate commerce must also be consonant with constitutional concepts of due process. A nexus must exist between the tax and activities within the state for which the tax is exacted, and “the [controlling] question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.” <em>Standard Steel Co. v.

The foregoing analysis, however, constrains us to disagree with those courts which have concluded that Congress intended “solicitation” to be narrowly construed. <em>Cal-Roof Wholesale Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm’n, </em><a href="/or/242/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="242 Or. 435" data-case-ids="2104230" data-case-paths="/or/242/0435-01">242 Or. 435</a>, <a href="/or/242/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="242 Or. 435" data-case-ids="2104230" data-case-paths="/or/242/0435-01">410 P.2d 233</a> (1967); <em>Hervey </em>v. <em>AMF Beaird, Inc., </em><a href="/ark/250/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="250 Ark. 147" data-case-ids="1636863" data-case-paths="/ark/250/0147-01">250 Ark. 147</a>, <a href="/ark/250/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="250 Ark. 147" data-case-ids="1636863" data-case-paths="/ark/250/0147-01">464 S.W.2d 557</a> (1971) (citing <em>Cal-Roof).</em>

Although this Court has never construed the word “solicitation” in the framework of § 381, we have had occasion to consider the term in other contexts. In <em>Business Tax Bureau of the School Dist. of Philadelphia v. American Cyanamid Co., </em><a href="/pa/426/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="426 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1908552" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0069-01">426 Pa. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20A.2d%20116" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="231 A.2d 116">231 A.2d 116</a> (1967), we discussed solicitation in the context of what constitutes “doing business” for purposes of a general business tax. <em>See also Shambe v. Delaware &amp; Hudson R.R., </em><a href="/pa/288/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="288 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1100767" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0240-01">288 Pa. 240</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20755" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="135 A.2d 755">135 A.2d 755</a> (1927). In those cases, we had to determine what activities would amount to something more than “solicitation” such that the taxpayer would be subject to the tax. We have said that acts of courtesy performed by business solicitors, in order to satisfy or accommodate customers, did not go beyond solicitation; nor was it relevant that the solicitors were provided facilities to carry on their solicitations. <em>See </em><a href="/pa/426/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="426 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1908552" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0069-01">426 Pa. at 76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20A.2d%20116" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="231 A.2d 116">231 A.2d at 119</a>, <em>citing Lutz v.

The import of these decisions is that “solicitation” does not stop at the moment a prospective customer (or wholesaler) is asked to consider purchasing the seller’s goods: other practices incident to the initial contact between buyer and seller, such as advice on making the product attractive to the ultimate consumer, also fall under the rubric “solicitation.”</p>

      <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>We therefore conclude that § 381 exempts appellant from Pennsylvania’s corporation income tax. Appellant’s only contacts with this state — visiting retail outlets, introducing new products, and advising retailers on making attractive displays of appellant’s products — are inextricably related to solicitation. Subsection (2) of § 381(a) envisioned precisely the kind of sales activities engaged in by appellant’s representatives: an effort to generate sales at the retail level so that appellant’s direct customers (Pennsylvania wholesalers) will order more of appellant’s products to be able to satisfy the retailers’ needs. We agree with the New York court in <em>Gillette </em>that making evanescent distinctions between “solicitation” and “solicitation plus” or “merchandising,” when the activities in question were all incident to soliciting business, would defeat the very purpose of § 381. Solicitation cannot mean that a foreign corporation may do no more than send salespeople into another state who leave brochures describing their employer’s products, hoping the prospective customer will then take the initiative to contact the employer for a possible sale. A company which sends ten “missionary representatives” into a state to “solicit orders” cannot hope to solicit those orders by having those ten persons call on every consumer to buy its product. All of the activities of appellant’s representatives were a kind of solicitation activity — as much so as the exchanging of friendly amenities between a solicitor and the potential customer.</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[275,1735,1145,579]]]'>We also think it insignificant that appellant furnishes its solicitors with automobiles. <em>See Coors Porcelain Co. v.

Congress could hardly have intended to exempt only walking solicitors. We do not think Congress intended factors such as how the solicitors get from customer to customer to be determinative of which interstate corporations enjoy § 381 immunity. The representatives’ means of transportation does not change the character of their promotional activities. In our view, appellant’s activities in Pennsylvania are confined to “solicitation” within the meaning of § 381.</p>
