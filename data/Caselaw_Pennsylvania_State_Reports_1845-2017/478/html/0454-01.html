George and Bessie Zamantakis placed an advertisement in a local newspaper offering to rent a four room apartment. Sylvester and Willis Thornton responded to the advertisement on that same day and were not permitted to rent the apartment. On February 16, 1972, the Thorntons, who are black, filed a complaint with the Commission charging that the Zamantakises, who are white, had refused to rent them the apartment because of the Thorn-tons’ race. Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the Commission found that the Zamantakises had denied the Thorntons the apartment because of their race, and on November 27, 1972, ordered, among other things, the Zamantakises to pay each Thornton $250.00 within 30 days in order to compensate them for mental anguish and humiliation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> An appeal from this order was taken to Commonwealth Court, which in an opinion written by the late and Honorable Harry A. Kramer and filed on August 14, 1973, held that the Commission had no authority to award damages for mental anguish and humiliation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> A petition for allowance of appeal to this <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>Court was then filed by the Commission.

We first note that in the Pennsylvania statute, there is no specific legislative language authorizing the Commission to award such damages. Next, we note that the statutorily provided proceeding is directed to be expeditious and informal, as are most administrative procedures. There are none of the formal trappings, evidentiary protections,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and strict procedures of a court of law. In addition, the members of the Commission necessarily need not be trained or learned in the law. As so often happens in an administrative proceeding, the Commission and its employes are the investigators, the prosecutors, the judges and jury. On balance, this results in an unduly heavy force on the side of the proponents of damages. Traditionally, damages, in this Commonwealth, have been a matter for courts of law, under an adversary system of justice and therefore unless the Legislature clearly authorizes the Commission to award damages, we cannot extend to it such authority by judicial fiat, nor can we broaden the scope of the Commission’s authority into a full scale lawsuit. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 960.”</blockquote>

If one were to adopt this argument, the Commission could fine and imprison persons for discrimination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>. Of course, no such power emanates out of the Act. Sixteen months after Commonwealth Court’s decision in this case, the Legislature amended the Human Relations Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> This amendment eliminated the Commission as the exclusive remedy for discrimination when the provisions of the Human Relations Act are invoked, and provided, under certain conditions, access to the Court of Common Pleas. The amendment gave to the courts authority to order, in addition to the same “affirmative action” as the Commission, “any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate”. “Legal or equitable relief” includes damages for humiliation and mental anguish. We must presume that the Legislature was aware of Commonwealth Court’s decision in this case, yet the Legislature still chose not to give the Commission the power to award these types of damages, but instead chose to have the Common Pleas Court award these damages.</p>

An order requiring a party violating the Law to pay a victim compensatory damages would provide redress for the victim for deprivation of his civil rights as well as deterring future illegal discrimination. The Legislature surely had these important goals in mind when it enacted the Human Relations Law, and a remedy of damages is entirely consistent with other remedies available to the PHRC. The Legislature’s command that the provisions of the Human Relations Law be construed liberally, see Human Relations Law, § 12(a), 43 P.S. § 962(a); <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm’n v.

The majority concedes that the PHRC has discretion to tailor its relief by choosing from the various remedies available. The agency acted under the view that compensatory damages were a proper form of relief. Had the PHRC known that today the Court would hold that it lacked power to impose this form of relief, it might have shaped its order to include other remedies or to stiffen penalties validly imposed. Thus, so that the PHRC may have an opportunity to correct its order and to award the proper relief which it alone may determine, subject only to review for abuse of discretion, the majority should not affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court but should instead remand to the PHRC so that it may impose appropriate remedies not inconsistent with today’s unwise opinion.</p>
