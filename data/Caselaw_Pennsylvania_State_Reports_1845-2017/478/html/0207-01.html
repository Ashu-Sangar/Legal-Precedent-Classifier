He asked Cox about her relationship with the victim, Jonathan Kent, and she replied that they were good friends. Cox asked Greenwood why he wanted to know and Greenwood replied that she would soon be dating him (Greenwood). When Cox and Greenwood re-entered the livingroom, Kent left the house through the front door. While on the porch, Kent was shot and killed by assailants using a shotgun and a .38 caliber pistol.

During his opening statement, the prosecutor indicated that appellant and his cohorts had “set a trap” to murder the victim.

While we do not express an opinion on the propriety of the trial court’s ruling, we believe the prosecutor’s opening statement was made in good faith, based on a reasonable belief that the evidence was admissible.

There, the witness testified as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and also expressed his opinion that all the defense witnesses were lying.

The remark was not directed to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Nor did the prosecutor blanketly attack the appellant’s credibility.
