According to the 1970 census, its population is 15,411. Compared to the general makeup of the Pittsburgh metropolitan region, it is a wealthy community. Two-thirds of the households would qualify for the top twenty per cent income range of the region. Over ninety per cent of its residents live in owner occupied housing, compared to about sixty-five per cent for the region. The percentage of blacks living in the community is less than one per cent. The percentage of the aged living in the community is much less than the percentage of the aged living in the region. Basically the community is made up of middle-aged home owners.

For purposes of this appeal, we have no choice but to conclude that the appellant is not attacking the constitutionality of Upper St. Clair’s zoning ordinance. This important point is not simply a matter of semantics. At no time since appellee filed its original application has appellant argued that Upper St. Clair’s zoning ordinance is unconstitutional. We therefore do not have before us, and neither did the Commonwealth Court, the issue as to whether appellant’s zoning ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Under these circumstances, we must presume its constitutionality. <em>Schuback v. Silver, </em>

The Department’s own planning advisor testified that no application to build multi-family dwellings was ever denied in Upper St. Clair Township. As to the township’s parks, the record shows that Upper St. Clair’s recreational facilities are open to any persons desiring to make use of them.

This argument basically calls for a quota system for each community. We utterly reject such a proposition. If the appellant can deny to the appellee a grant of funds because the appelleecommunity has substantial imbalances according to race, ethnic background, age or wealth, it could do so to any community with similar imbalances. For instance, a community made up exclusively of the aged would have a substantial imbalance. Likewise would a community that is predominately black, Catholic or youthful, or has less than its quota of Americans of Italian origin. Many, if not most, of the communities in the Commonwealth have substantial imbalances. Indeed, the appellant points out that the city of Pittsburgh has a substantial imbalance in the number of blacks and the number of persons below the poverty level. Under the appellant’s reasoning, funds could be denied to a community that was primarily black, or Oriental, Mexican-American, or Puerto Rican. All of these communities would, in the sense in which the word is used by the appellant, be considered “exclusive” communities. Yet we certainly would not in the case of every “exclusive” community conclude in the absence of any other evidence, that the <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>community can be denied government assistance because of the alleged existence of an unproven policy. A “policy” does not exist in a vacuum. It requires at least minimal action. Someone must formulate it; someone must implement it. If no one has done anything to <em>cause </em>the exclusiveness, it is not “policy.”</p>

For example, the funds at issue in this case were borrowed from the federal government. Could Pennsylvania have been denied this Federal assistance because of imbalances in Pennsylvania’s population without proof that the imbalances resulted from unconstitutional laws or constitutional laws unconstitutionally applied?</p>

A housing project, for instance, containing more than one building, in which blacks are exclusively in one building and whites in another, can reasonably lead to the conclusion, without further evidence, that those in charge of the housing project have contributed to the imbalances existing in the buildings. <em>See Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm’n v.

Imbalances existing within various schools in a community, without further evidence, may reasonably permit the conclusion that official action has been a cause in producing the imbalances. <em>See Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm’n v.

Unlike a controlled situation such as a particular housing project, where factors which might have caused the imbalance are limited, a geographical area’s population of blacks, aged, or poor is affected by innumerable factors over 'which government may have no control. Climate, geographic distances, economic opportunity, the existence or nonexistence of public transportation, and familial ties are just some of the factors contributing to the imbalances existing in many segments of our society. Because of these innumerable factors, many of which in a free society are beyond governmental control, the inference that official conduct is responsible for a particular area’s imbalance is not as readily drawn absent at least some evidence that it was official conduct that contributed to the imbalance.</p>

Appellant properly alerted itself to the possibility of unconstitutional or illegal conduct in Upper St. Clair based on these imbalances. Our responsibility in such a case is to look behind the imbalances to determine whether the exclusivity has come about because of unconstitutional laws or other official action. In this case, however, there is no claim that an unconstitutional ordinance has been in effect, or that any official conduct has applied the ordinances in a discriminatory manner. There has been no showing that official conduct in any way contributed to the imbalances. There is, therefore, simply no basis for penalizing Upper St. Clair for the mere existence of the situation. If appellant’s position were to prevail, a community could be penalized solely for its ethnic religious, color, wealth, or sexual makeup in spite of the fact that its zoning ordinance is constitutional and no evidence is presented that the community’s officials ever discriminated in implementing the ordinance.

Project 500 funds were to be made available to eligible municipalities, not to the Department of Community Affairs. Here, Upper St. Clair complied with all the Department’s regulations in the course of applying for funds, and the Department Staff approved its application. If the Secretary of the Department carrying out his statutory mandate to determine municipalities’ park needs and the advisability of granting State funds to meet those needs, decides to deny an application, it is upon him to articulate his reasons for the denial. It is the Department’s function to determine where the recreation and park needs of political subdivisions are greatest, in other words to determine “pressing community needs” in regard to recreation and parks. It would be incongruous to put the burden on an applicant for funds to demonstrate that its needs are more pressing than another political subdivision’s when this is precisely why the Department of Community Affairs was entrusted with administering and allocating these funds. The Department is better able to gain access to the particular facts necessary to make an intelligent decision regarding where the Commonwealth’s park and recreational needs are most compelling. In our view, objective fairness in the allocation of scarce state resources dictates that this state agency, with its superior manpower, expertise, and information-gathering ability, have the “burden” of articulating its reasons why one community is more in need of state funds than another.</p>

    <p id="b606-7" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[265,1569,1145,344]]]'>The record reveals no lack of open space or parkland in Upper St. Clair and the Township has since 1968 substantially expanded the 130 acres devoted to local parkland. The Department of Community Affairs participated in this expansion program, providing $325,000 in Project 500 funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> These facts alone fully support the Department’s determination made in its sound discretion.</p>

Rather, those funds may, within proper agency discretion, be used to advance <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>public policy. While a community, such as Upper St. Clair, may have a “right” to enact a zoning ordinance which, within the constitution, protects its character and self interest, it does not have a concomitant right to have the State pay for its parks. In allocating limited funds, a state agency in determining whether it is advisable to grant that community funding pursuant to its legislative authority, may properly consider such things as community development policies, general access to the proposed facility, the community’s needs for the facility and the community’s independent ability to finance the project.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[238,904,1145,512]]]'>Because the record clearly supports the determination of the Department of Community Affairs that allocating funds to Upper St. Clair was not advisable, the agency’s discretionary action must be upheld. To do otherwise discourages governmental officials from exercising their discretionary authority to serve the interests of all individuals in the Commonwealth and advance state and national public interests. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the action of the Department of Community Affairs.</p>
