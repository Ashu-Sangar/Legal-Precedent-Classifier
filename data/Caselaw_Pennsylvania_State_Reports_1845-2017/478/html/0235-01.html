The regulations issued by the Court Administrator and the President Judge required Traffic Court employees to cease political activities. Thirty-eight did so and had their names removed from the May, 1978, primary ballot. Despite the unanimous decision of <em>In re Prohibition of Political Activities, </em>• supra, and despite the clarity of the directives of respondents which erect an unbreachable barrier between political activities and the judicial system, the majority grants petitioner the right to continue his political ward activities during his court employment.

Because the Court there properly refused to permit even a bid for reelection in which partisan politics would play no role, the Court most assuredly should refuse the writ of prohibition here, instead of directing, as the majority does, that petitioner may run for ward committee of a political party.</p>

Petitioner admitted at oral argument that he had no constitutional or legal right to run for political office without resigning from the Traffic Court staff. He argued only that the March, 1978, directive of the President Judge of the Traffic Court unfairly surprised him because of its timing. Petitioner could not have been surprised by this directive unless he deliberately closed his eyes to events staring him in the face. The court administrator issued regulations forbidding court employees from engaging in political activity as early as March, 1976. <em>In re Prohibition of Political Activities, </em><a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">supra,</a> <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">473 Pa. at </a>558 n.2, <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">375 A.2d at </a>1258 n.2.

Requiring petitioner to remove his name from the ballot or resign from the Traffic Court as the regulations require would permit the office for which he is running to be filled by popular vote and avoid the unseemly situation in which, by misuse of the writ of prohibition, a court order directly affects a strictly political contest.</p>

But parties represent “politics” in the narrower and more commonly accepted sense of the word, viz., the selection and election of candidates for public office, as distinguished from the Aristotelian sense. Because this Court is convinced that such activities by court employees present a danger to “not only the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judicial system but also the appearance of these qualities,” <em>In re Prohibition of Political Activities, <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">473 Pa. at 560</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">375 A.2d at 1259</a>, the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania has required “a steadfast separation of partisan political activity from the judicial function [so that] the confidence of the public in courts and judges [can] be merited and maintained.” <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">Id.,</a> <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">473 Pa. at 560</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">375 A.2d at 1259-60</a>.
