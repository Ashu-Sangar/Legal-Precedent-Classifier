Appellee’s truck was allegedly 23,700 pounds overweight. In a hearing before a district judge, appellee was found guilty, and a fine of $4,700 was imposed. Appellee appealed and a trial de novo was held in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. In the nonjury trial, appellee was found guilty of being 1700 pounds overweight and a fine of $120.00 was imposed.</p>

The prosecution, however, filed an appeal in the Superior Court contending that the fine of $120.00 imposed was not the proper fine under the penalty section of the Motor Vehicle Code, 903(k). That section provides a schedule of graduated fines for motor vehicles that are overweight. The more overweight, the higher the fine. According to the prosecution, the trial court should have imposed a greater fine but did not do so because it erroneously held that a greater penalty for the violation of which appellee was found guilty would be unconstitutional.</p>

Appellee was <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>found guilty of operating a vehicle which was 1700 pounds overweight. Under 903(k), the legislatively mandated penalty for being 1700 pounds overweight is $120. The prosecution does not dispute that fact in this appeal and, as the colloquy previously noted indicates, the prosecution itself informed the trial court that the correct penalty was $120. Defense counsel agreed with the prosecutor. No issue was raised at the time the judgment of sentence was imposed that the legislative mandate was not being followed, and no claim is made before us that the $120 fine was not the proper fine based upon the verdict. There is no doubt that the judgment imposed followed the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[259,985,1146,612]]]'>In this appeal, nonetheless, for the first time, the prosecution contends that, under 903(k), a fine of $4,700 should have been imposed. The prosecution’s argument is based on <em>its assumption </em>that the verdict in this case found the appellee guilty of being 23,700 pounds overweight. That, however, was not the verdict. The prosecution argues that the evidence at trial showed that appellee was 23,700 pounds overweight. What the evidence showed, however, is irrelevant on appeal. We cannot go behind the verdict. In a criminal case at the appellate level, we cannot impose a new verdict or any verdict other than the verdict found by the trier of fact.</p>
    <p id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[259,1629,1146,252]]]'>The prosecution also seems to base <em>its assumption </em>as to the verdict entered on its interpretation of the trial court’s opinion filed on November 19, 1974, more than three and one-half months after the conclusion of the appellee’s trial which ended on August 2, 1974.</p>

Rule 302 of the Pa. Rules of Crim.P., states that:</p>

There are two different sections of the Motor Vehicle Code which are concerned with overweight violations: 903(a) and 903(c).</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[238,1178,654,42]]]'>Section 903(a) provides as follows:</p>

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.3",82,[255,300,1151,1107]]]'>
      <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>Section 903(c) also contains “overweight” prohibitions, but of a different kind. In order to understand Section 903(c), it is first necessary to point out that <em>residents </em>of Pennsylvania are required, when registering certain commercial motor vehicles, to register a “gross weight” for that vehicle. Nonresidents of Pennsylvania, even though driving commercial vehicles in Pennsylvania, are not required to register a “gross weight” for their commercial motor vehicles in Pennsylvania. Act of April 29, 1959, P.L. 58, § 410(e), 75 P.S. § 410(e). The maximum gross weight for which a resident registers a vehicle determines the amount of registration fee which must be paid to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for that vehicle. The gross weight registered may not exceed that which the vehicle is designed to handle nor may it exceed the 73,280 pounds gross weight limit of 903(a) even if the vehicle is designed to handle a greater weight. One may, however, register the motor vehicle for a gross weight <em>less </em>than the total gross weight for which the vehicle could be registered. By doing so the owner pays a smaller registration fee than would be paid if that motor vehicle were registered for its maximum permissible gross weight.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[253,1429,1147,792]]]'>Thus, if a resident of Pennsylvania has a motor vehicle which qualifies for a gross weight allowance of 73,280 pounds, and the vehicle is registered for that weight and the proper fee paid, that person would be permitted a gross weight on the highways of Pennsylvania of 73,280 pounds. On the other hand, if that vehicle, although qualifying to be registered for a gross weight of 73,280 pounds, is registered, at the option of the owner, at the lesser weight of 50,000 pounds, that vehicle would be in violation of the Motor Vehicle Code if it were on the highways carrying 73,280 pounds. The violation would not be of Section 903(a) because there is no violation under that section so long as the gross weight does not exceed 73,280 pounds. It would, however, be a violation of Section 903(c) because the 73,280 pounds would be in excess of the registered gross weight.</p>
    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[254,2247,1144,96]],["BL_83.1",83,[193,272,1148,517]]]'>It can thus be seen that Section 903(a) concerns itself primarily with what we will call for purposes of this opinion <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>a <em>highway safety overweight. </em>On the other hand, Section 903(c) concerns itself with a <em>registration fee overweight. </em>One could, of course, be in violation of both sections simultaneously. This would be the case if a resident of Pennsylvania were traveling on the highways of Pennsylvania with a gross weight in excess of 73,280 pounds. Since no registration is normally permitted above 73,280 pounds, a weight in excess of that figure could be in violation of Section 903(a), as well as Section 903(c), since that vehicle could not have been registered for any weight above 73,280 pounds.</p>

Appellee had, however, registered his vehicle in New Jersey, which, it appears from the record has registration provisions similar to Pennsylvania’s.

A Bensalem Township police officer stopped the vehicle, caused it to be <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>weighed, and learned that the gross weight was 73,700 pounds, 420 pounds above the maximum gross weight of 73,280 pounds which is permitted upon Pennsylvania highways without special permit. The officer discovered, as well, that the rig had been registered in the State of New Jersey for an allowable gross weight of 50,000 pounds. Notwithstanding the fact that it was of the size and nature which might have been registered in Pennsylvania at the permissible maximum of 73,280 pounds, the arresting officer charged the appellant with having violated Section 903(c) of the Code, 75 P.S. 903(c), and calculated the excess weight as 23,700 pounds, based upon which the justice of the peace levied a fine of $4,700.</p>

In the event the excess is above 6,500 pounds the fine is provided to be $600. plus $50.00 for each additional 500 pounds or part thereof in excess of such 6,500 pounds; and provided further, that where the gross weight exceeds 73,-280 pounds, the fine “shall be double the amount determined”; in accordance with the schedule. It is readily seen that the justice of the peace calculated the fine upon the ■basis of a 23,700 pound excess; i. e., the difference between the actual weight, 73,700 pounds, and the registered weight, 50.000 pounds. Obviously, had the vehicle been registered at 72.000 pounds as it was immediately after the offense, the overweight would have amounted to 1,700 pounds resulting in a fine of $120.00 rather than $4,700.

Had the vehicle been registered in Pennsylvania (using the closest registration figures) a fee of $380.00 would have been paid for a registration of 52,000 pounds and a fee of $535.00 for a registration of 73,280 pounds.

Upon reflection he believes that his calculations should have been based upon 73,280 pounds, the registration which the rig might have secured in this Commonwealth, and not upon 72,000, although the resulting fine in each case would have been the same.</p>

But are the enforcement efforts made for the laudable purposes which lie behind the statute? Perhaps so. But the perhaps equally, or greater, motivating force is to be found in the windfall fines — the trophies — which end up in the municipal treasuries. In fact some appeals, it is rumored, are “settled” by negotiations carried on between counsel for an owner convicted in summary proceedings of an overweight violation, and counsel for the municipality, by the municipality’s negotiating a lower “fine” in exchange for the withdrawal of a pending appeal. Such negotiations and court “settlements” are undoubtedly illegal but illustrate the basic interest of the municipalities in overweight arrests and convictions. Most candid solicitors for the municipalities involved will readily admit the nature of this monetary interest.

But the application of the overweight fine schedule in such a way that the owners of two identical truck-trailer combinations are subjected to different penalties, relating only to a registration fee, although each may be carrying the identical load and weight, is a violation of the Equal Protection Laws guaranteed to all citizens.

I cannot agree with the intimations in the opinion of the Court that the opinion of the trial court, merely because filed after this appeal was taken, is rendered suspect as a guide to what the trial judge intended and what was in fact accomplished at the time of rendering verdict and imposing sentence. Opinions of trial courts <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>are not required unless and until an appeal is taken and the trial judge is duly notified of that fact. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a). The reason for requiring an opinion of the trial court, of course, is because of the assistance it may be to the appellate court in understanding the reasoning of the court of original jurisdiction in taking the actions complained of on appeal.</p>

      <p id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[268,1025,1077,110]]]'>“Under the testimony presented to the Hearing Judge, there was no question that the appellant was guilty of the offense charged. Section 903(c) provides:</p>
      <p id="b101-8" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[267,1142,1079,222]]]'>‘No combination of which a commercial vehicle or truck tractor having a registered gross weight is a part shall, when operated upon a highway, have a gross weight exceeding the sum of (1) the registered gross weight of the commercial motor vehicle or truck tractor plus (2) the registered gross weights, if any, of the other vehicles in the combination. .</p>
      <p id="b101-9" data-blocks='[["BL_101.8",101,[267,1376,1078,110]]]'>The appellant did in fact carry weight exceeding the 50,000 pounds for which his rig had been registered, and exceeding the permissible maximum of 73,280 pounds.” Record at 51a -52a.</p>
      <p id="b101-10" data-blocks='[["BL_101.9",101,[231,1493,423,32]]]'>The trial judge concluded:</p>
      <p id="b101-11" data-blocks='[["BL_101.10",101,[266,1532,1080,265]]]'>“The attempt to levy a $4,700 penalty for such ail alleged infraction of Section 903(c) amounts to confiscation of the appellant’s property without due process of law and cannot be upheld. He [the trial judge] is of the opinion, as well, that the application of the overweight penalty provisions to the circumstances of this case reveals a clear violation and denial of the appellant’s equal protection rights.</p>
      <p id="b101-12" data-blocks='[["BL_101.11",101,[265,1805,1080,384]]]'>“Having this view, and having found the appellant guilty of an overweight offense, <em>he </em>[the trial judge] <em>applied the overweight penalty schedule using 72,000 pounds as a base on the perhaps erroneous assumption that such figure represented the apparent maximum weight registration allowed in the State of New Jersey He thus found the overweight to have been 1,700 pounds and the proper fine to be $120, </em>the $60 minimum being doubled as provided in Section 903, by reason of the weight having exceeded the maximum allowable in the Commonwealth.” Record at 56a.

      <p id="b101-13" data-blocks='[["BL_101.12",101,[230,2197,1112,110]]]'>The trial court went on to indicate that its overweight calculation should have been based on 73,280 pounds, not 72,000 pounds, although the resultant fine would be the same in either case.</p>
