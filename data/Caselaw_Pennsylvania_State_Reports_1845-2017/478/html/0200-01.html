    <p id="b242-11" data-blocks='[["BL_242.10",242,[279,1391,1147,410]]]'>The facts are as follows. At approximately 10:30 p.m., on July 27, 1974, Arthur Lewis was shot in front of his aunt’s home at 1335 Rodman Street in Philadelphia. The victim’s aunt, Lily Purnell, testified that she heard what sounded like two loud firecrackers. She went to the window of her home and saw Lewis lying on the ground. She noticed a young black man riding a bicycle at a fast rate of speed away from the scene of the shooting.</p>

When Officer Brosuski saw two black youths leaving the scene on bicycles, going very fast, he turned his car around and followed the pair. When the bicyclists split up, Officer Brosuski followed appellant and eventually caught up with him. When appellant was arrested, he was on his knees on the ground in a vacant lot. After appellant was taken away in a police wagon, Brosuski returned to the 1300 block of Rodman <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>Street and determined that a shooting had occurred. He then went to the location of appellant’s arrest and found a gun loosely buried in the dirt. The victim died two days later as a result of the gunshot wounds.</p>

Appellant then gave an inculpatory statement, telling police that he shot the victim to avenge the shooting of a friend.</p>

Here, however, appellant did not reiterate his confession, for his trial testimony substantially differed from both confessions. In the confessions, appellant told police the killing was motivated by revenge and he did the shooting. At trial, appellant’s testimony indicated that he went along out of fear of gang pressure and that he did not fire the gun.

We do not agree. In <em>Futch, </em>this court, in interpreting Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 (now 130) determined that any evidence obtained during a period of “unnecessary delay” <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>between arrest and arraignment was inadmissible at trial if such evidence was reasonably related to the unnecessary delay. The <em>Futch </em>court did not create an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained during periods of necessary delay. We believe that a reasonable delay attributable to waiting for the parents of a juvenile defendant under the <em>McCutchen </em>holding is “necessary delay” under the <em>Futch </em>rationale. We therefore reject the Commonwealth’s contention that <em>Futch </em>mandated noncompliance with <em>McCutchen.</em>

The Commonwealth states that appellant’s father was told of his son’s rights, but our review of the record reveals no such fact. As the original waiver was ineffectual with no rewarnings, appellant’s second confession must also be suppressed.</p>

J., and Larsen, J.), and the dissenting opinions cited therein, I remain opposed to this Court’s continued application of its <em>per se </em>rule excluding juvenile confessions. The punitive exclusion is peculiarly inappropriate in cases such as this, where the police conduct complained of <em>(i.e., </em>failure to obtain parental or other adult counseling for the juvenile prior to taking any statement) occurred before the announcement of that rule. I must once more register my disagreement with this renewed application of an ill-conceived and illogical rule. Hence this dissent.</p>
