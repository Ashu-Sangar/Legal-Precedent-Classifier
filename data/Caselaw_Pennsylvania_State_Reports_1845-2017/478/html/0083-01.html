McCauley died intestate on May 12, 1974, and letters of administration were granted to his widow, Charlotte McCauley, the present appellant. Among the assets in the decedent’s estate was a credit balance of $2,222.95 in an account which decedent had with the Philadelphia Police and Fire Credit Union, the appellee herein (Credit Union). Payment of this balance to the estate was requested but refused, whereupon a citation was issued to Credit Union to show cause why the proceeds should not be paid over to Charlotte McCauley as administratrix. The citation went unheeded, with neither an appearance nor an answer filed thereto, and, on July 14, 1975, the orphans’ court division ordered that payment be made to the estate. Three months later, on <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>October 15, 1975, appellee Credit Union filed a petition to strike the decree directing payment to the estate. The petition alleged that the decedent had executed a designation of beneficiary form which required Credit Union to pay the fund to decedent’s son, Michael McCauley. A rule to show cause was granted forthwith, but was not served upon appellant until January 30, 1976. Thereafter, an answer containing new matter was filed by the administratrix and a reply to the new matter by Credit Union. On April 1, 1976, apparently without a hearing, the trial court granted the petition to strike.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The present appeal followed,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and we now reverse.</p>

In the case at bar Credit Union, as a defense to the original petition of the administratrix that the amount owing by Credit Union be paid to her, now belatedly asserts the existence of evidence <em>dehors </em>the record, viz., a designation of beneficiary form executed by the decedent. It is not alleged that the judgment is void or for any reason invalid; it is alleged that there exists a defense on the merits. Having failed to raise this matter at the proper time, appellee should have sought permission to do so out of time, by means of a petition to open the judgment, in which the equities of the situation would be set forth.

The majority, in reversing the decree of the Orphans’ Court Division vacating judgment without prejudice so that all real parties in interest may be made a party to the proceedings, loses sight of the fact that orphans’ court proceedings are basically equitable in nature and are to be conducted accordingly. See Orphans’ Court Rule 3.1; Cf. <em>Smith v. Dale, </em><a href="/pa/405/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="405 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1303577" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0293-01">405 Pa. 293</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%2078" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="175 A.2d 78">175 A.2d 78</a> (1961) (action in assumpsit). The propriety of relief is therefore to be determined on the basis of equitable principles. The scope of our review in such instances is limited to the question of whether the action of the orphans’ court constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Smith v. Dale, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[209,1093,1150,984]]]'>Here, the orphans’ court, while noting that the carelessness and negligence of the Credit Union caused the present confusion, nevertheless determined that the interests of justice required that the son, the real party in interest, be before the Court prior to proceeding further. I cannot conclude that this was an abuse of discretion. The funds in the Credit Union account have not yet been distributed. The orphans’ court carefully provided that its action was without prejudice to appellant’s right to file an amended petition for citation to all real parties in interest to show cause why the funds held by the Credit Union should not be paid to her. Appellant may now proceed to prove her entitlement to the funds. The action of the orphans’ court, unlike the majority opinion, allows the determination of who is entitled to the funds decedent had deposited with the Credit Union to be made in a single proceeding. Thus, I dissent and would affirm the action of the Orphans’ Court Division.</p>
