XIII, § 1301, 43 P.S. § 1101.1301, by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (hereafter PLRB or Board).

The Board refused to consider the defenses raised by the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth had failed to appeal the arbitrator’s decision. On July 15, 1974, the Board issued a nisi order directing enforcement of the arbitrator’s award.

The Commonwealth Court’s decision presents the aggrieved party with a choice of two courses of action.

Such action, of course, forces the party in whose favor the arbitrator originally ruled to seek enforcement of the award through a Section 1301 enforcement action. The party aggrieved by the arbitrator’s decision should have one route of appeal: that provided by Pa.R.J.A. 2101. Any subsequent Section 1301 enforcement proceeding necessitated by an unfair labor practice charge under § 1201(a)(8) would be simplified and made more expeditious because the Board would need only determine whether there had been an arbitrator’s award with which a party had not complied. We therefore reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, and reinstate the order of the Board ordering enforcement of the arbitrator’s award.</p>

In doing so, the legislature also recognized the need for binding arbitration to ensure finality in the settlement of disputes arising out of collective bargaining agreements. 43 P.S. § 1101.903.

Binding arbitration renders the collective bargaining process more meaningful to both the employer and the employee. It strengthens the worker’s confidence in the equity of the agreement by assuring that disputes over its meaning will be resolved by a neutral third party; it encourages more careful decisionmaking on the part of the public employer who knows that decisions will be subject to the scrutiny of an impartial arbitrator whose decisions will be binding; and it creates pressures to settle disputes at lower management levels.</p>

However, resolution of all disputes by resort to economic force is costly to the parties, and more importantly, to the public. <em>The General Assembly therefore chose to make the widely used procedure of labor arbitration mandatory under the PERA. </em>This brings the special expertise of labor arbitrators to bear on the often difficult problems of administering the collective bargaining agreement while assuring parties that their agreement will be effective and guaranteeing both the parties and the public that such disputes will not disrupt peaceful labor relations or interrupt public services.” (Footnotes omitted.)

PERA implements this principle by making failure to comply with an arbitrator’s award an unfair labor practice under Section 1201(a)(8). Allowing the party aggrieved by the arbitrator’s decision to refuse to abide by that decision undercuts this strong policy favoring finality in the arbitration of labor disputes. It encourages the aggrieved party to ignore the normal appeal procedure, knowing that if a subsequent enforcement proceeding is brought it will provide a second opportunity to litigate the validity of the award, thus delaying the finality of the arbitration. If the party against whom the arbitrator rules is permitted to disregard that award, the arbitration process would lose effectiveness, with the result that the policies and objectives established by Section 101 of the Act would be frustrated.</p>

Section 903, however, does not specify what constitutes “binding” arbitration. We believe that the language of Section 903, when read in light of the policies and objectives underlying the enactment of PERA, dictates that <em>any </em>decision of an arbitrator made pursuant to Section 903 is “deemed binding” for purposes of enforcement under Section 1301 as soon as that decision becomes final in the sense that it is no longer appealable pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 2101.

Once the appeal procedure provided by Pa.R.J.A. 2101 has been completed (whether by appeal to the Commonwealth Court and petition for allowance of appeal to us or by allowing the time period for appeal to expire without taking any action), the award is final and “deemed binding” for purposes of Section 1301.</p>
