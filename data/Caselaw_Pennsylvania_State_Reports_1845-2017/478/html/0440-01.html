Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence is sufficient if, accepting as true all the evidence and all reasonable inferences upon which, if believed, the jury could have based its verdict, it is sufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant is guilty of murder of the first degree. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v.

The two left together at approximately 10:30 p. m. At 10:50 p. m., a nurse at Harrisburg Hospital observed appellant drive his car through a red light in front of the hospital and enter the front entrance of the hospital at a high rate of speed. <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>Appellant’s wife was in the front seat of the car, bleeding profusely from the mouth.

    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[219,488,1149,669]]]'>Upon arriving at the emergency room entrance, appellant encountered two Harrisburg policemen in their patrol car about to go off duty. Both testified that appellant went over to the patrol car and stated that it was appellant that shot his wife. One officer testified that appellant’s words were, “Oh my God, I shot my wife, help me,” the other testified that appellant stated, “Oh my God, I just shot my wife.” A third person, an off-duty police officer working as a hospital security guard, also testified that he heard appellant say “God, help me, I shot my wife. . . . ” One officer, not sure of what he had just heard, asked appellant to repeat what he had said. Appellant again stated it was he who shot his wife.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[218,1188,1147,360]]]'>Appellant was read his constitutional rights, at which point he stated it was not he but an unknown assailant who shot his wife. Appellant testified that either a black man, or a person with a black glove on his hand, walked up to appellant’s car while he waited at a traffic light, and through the open rear window on the passenger side, fired a single shot into the back of his wife’s head.</p>

Expert witnesses testified that the muzzle of the gun had been held directly against a scarf appellant’s wife was wearing. Tests were conducted at the location appellant claimed the shooting took place. The police used a gun of the same caliber of the weapon that killed Mrs. Sero (the actual murder weapon has never been found), to determine whether powder residue would have been placed on the seat back and headrest if the incident had occurred as described by appellant and the gun had actually been placed against Mrs. Sero’s scarf. No powder residue was found on the seat back or headrest after it was analyzed on the night of the crime, but large amounts were found after these test firings. The prosecution also produced two witnesses who lived near the site at which <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>appellant claims the incident occurred. Neither heard any loud noises near the time appellant claims the shooting occurred, yet both witnesses testified they clearly heard the gun shots fired when the police conducted the aforementioned test outside their homes approximately four weeks after the actual shooting.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[287,646,1149,890]]]'>The prosecution also presented evidence to establish the motive appellant might have had for killing his wife. The prosecution presented testimony that appellant was in serious financial difficulties. His business had nearly failed while under his management, he had substantial loans outstanding, and appellant’s home was scheduled to be sold at a sheriff’s sale for failure to make mortgage payments. Appellant received notice of the sheriff’s sale the same day his wife was shot. Although appellant’s own life insurance policy had been cancelled, appellant kept up a $10,000 double indemnity life insurance policy on his wife as well as $25,000 of mortgage insurance on her life. It was also established that appellant had been discussing insurance matters with his insurance agent five days prior to the shooting, and that appellant telephoned his insurance company, in an effort to facilitate the processing of his claim, within hours after his wife expired.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[288,1557,1147,460]]]'>Although the murder weapon was not discovered, appellant’s insurance agent testified that in 1973, he saw a revolver in appellant’s desk drawer at his place of business. The prosecution’s last witness, a medical secretary employed at Harrisburg Hospital, testified that she observed appellant with his wife in the hospital’s intensive care unit the day after the’ shooting, that he squeezed his wife’s hand a number of times and stated in a normal speaking voice: “Son-of-a-bitch deserves to die.”</p>
    <p id="b486-7" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[290,2047,1146,308]],["BL_487.1",487,[225,328,1143,96]]]'>Mrs. Sero died four days after the shooting, without ever regaining consciousness. Death was due to “massive damage to the brain and massive hemorrhage in the brain in the subarachnoidal space.” These facts satisfy us that the evidence, taken as a whole, is sufficient to sustain the jury’s conclusion that the killing was “willful, deliberate and pre<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>meditated” and thus constituted murder of the first degree. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(a), (d) (Supp.1977 -78).</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[220,446,1150,988]]]'>Appellant’s first assignment of error is that certain juror misconduct warrants the grant of a new trial. Three weeks after the jury returned its verdict in the instant case, a woman who served as a juror was deposed and gave a statement in which she related what she believed to be jury misconduct. The only issue raised concerning the juror’s deposition is the juror’s statement that another juror told her that this juror’s husband had spoken to appellant’s brother who allegedly told him appellant was not a religious person but began studying the Bible after his wife’s death. Appellant claims this was misconduct on the part of a juror’s spouse, that prejudicial information was improperly communicated to a juror, and that this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em><a href="/pa/456/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="456 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="584477" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0265-01">456 Pa. 265</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="318 A.2d 737">318 A.2d 737</a> (1974), mandates a new trial. The prosecution argues alternatively that the juror’s statement is an incompetent effort to impeach the jury’s verdict; that the statement is objectionable as triple hearsay; and that prejudice that might have resulted from the conversation was harmless.</p>

Accepting appellant’s argument that variables such as the position of the front seat and the angle from which the gun was fired may have affected the test results, this fact was brought out to the jury and fully exploited on cross-examination, and the extent to which the actual conditions may have deviated from the test conditions was a consideration for the jury in determining the weight to be accorded the evidence. We are satisfied from a review of the record that the conditions under which the experiments were conducted were substantially similar to the facts as stated by the appellant. The experiments were therefore probative of the truthfulness of appellant’s testimony, and we find no abuse of discretion in allowing into evidence the results of the experiments.</p>

Regardless, our case law makes it clear the trial judge did not err in refusing appellant’s requested charge in this regard.</p>
