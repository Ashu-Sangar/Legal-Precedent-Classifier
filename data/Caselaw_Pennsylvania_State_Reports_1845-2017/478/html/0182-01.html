Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment. Sentence was suspended on the robbery and conspiracy convictions.

On July 3, 1974, the partially decomposed bodies of Willie Billingsley and Ernest Barnes were discovered in Billingsley’s Philadelphia residence. Both victims died of gunshot wounds to the head. The <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>medical examiner found it impossible to accurately determine the times of death, but he estimated that both deaths occurred between 6:00 a. m. on Monday, July 1, 1974 and 6:00 p. m. on Tuesday, July 2, 1974.</p>

Police discovered that a game was held on July 1, 1974, two days before the bodies were discovered. Investigation further revealed that Billingsley, during the week prior to his death, had “hit a number” for well over one thousand dollars. Despite the foregoing facts, no money was found on either of the victims or in the house. Further, when Billingsley’s body was discovered, the pockets of his trousers were pulled out and a large glass bank was broken into two pieces.</p>
    <p id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[238,1131,1147,732]]]'>During their investigation, the police found that appellant had been employed by Billingsley to serve food and drinks at his weekly poker games. She was originally questioned concerning Billingsley’s background; however, she subsequently gave police an inculpatory statement. According to appellant, in late June of 1974, a co-defendant, Ervin Warren, had stolen approximately $1,500 worth of payroll checks. Warren gave the checks to appellant, who gave them to Billingsley. Warren later decided to cash the checks himself and told appellant to get the checks back. When appellant forgot to get the checks, Warren, appellant and co-defendant Charles Jackson went to Billingsley’s home to recover the checks. Appellant knew both the purpose of the trip and that both of her companions had guns.</p>

Warren and Jackson then accompanied Billingsley to the upper floor of the house. Appellant stated that five minutes later she heard two or three shots from upstairs, which startled her, causing the gun she was holding to accidentally discharge, killing Barnes. Appellant stated that she then fled the premises and returned home.</p>

I remain unconvinced that the adherence to a lesser included offense analysis or to a theory of a jury’s “mercy-dispensing power” compels an unconditional right in all murder trials to an involuntary manslaughter instruction upon request by the defense. Nor do I believe that an instruction for involuntary manslaughter should be allowed simply because there may be a reasonable basis in the evidence to support a finding of involuntary manslaughter. <em>See Commonwealth v. Ford, <a href="/pa/474/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="474 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1732090" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0480-01">supra,</a> </em>474 at 485, <a href="/pa/474/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="474 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1732090" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0480-01">378 A.2d at 1216</a> (POMEROY, J., announcing the decision of this Court); <em>Commonwealth v.

The critical issue at trial was whether there was a malicious killing (i. e., one committed in the course of the commission of the felony of robbery) or a nonmalicious unintentional killing (involuntary manslaughter). Thus, we are here presented with a situation where the factual dispute centers upon the presence or absence of the element of malice, the element which distinguishes the higher grade of homicide from the lesser grade.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a> This is precisely the type of situation where an instruction on the lesser offense, upon request, is warranted. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Where the factual posture effectively excludes a realistic possibility of an acquittal, as is the case here, to deprive the accused of her right to allow the jury to consider the lesser offense is tantamount to depriving her of a defense. Where instructions on the lesser offense are given, the verdict will necessarily reflect the jury’s resolution of the disputed factual issue at trial. The finding of the higher verdict would evidence the prosecutor’s success in establishing the disputed element. Likewise the return of a guilty verdict on the lesser offense would reflect his failure to establish that element which distinguishes the two offenses.</p>

The judge in this case had, prior to the suppression hearing, presided at the trial of appellant’s co-defendant. At that trial, testimony was presented that appellant had been seen standing over the victim’s body with a gun in her hand. Having one’s credibility judged by someone who has previously been exposed to such incriminating evidence violated due process. Such a due process violation is not vitiated by the fact that appellant allowed the alleged confession to be read to the suppression court. At the suppression hearing, appellant challenged the statement as being involuntary. As such, she indirectly challenged its truthfulness. She should not have been forced to do that before a judge who had previously heard evidence concerning that issue. I therefore dissent.</p>
