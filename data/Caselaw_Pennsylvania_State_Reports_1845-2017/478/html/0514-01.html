      <em>independent </em>institutions of higher education. The Commonwealth Court, on the other hand, noting that in section 2 of the IAGA, quoted above, “independent” stood merely in contraposition to “public,” concluded that the word did not refer to a separate charter but only to a lack of control by the Commonwealth and that, therefore, assistance could not be denied merely because of the lack of a separate charter. The court, however, held that appellants, hospitals operating nursing schools, are not institutions of higher education, since “[a] nursing program is merely peripheral to the hospital’s basic function for which it was chartered — that of a health care provider.” 24 Pa.Cmwlth. at 356, 356 A.2d at 839. Although appellants agree with the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of “independent,” they contend they <em>are </em>nursing schools which have instituted their appeals under the corporate names they <em>share </em>with their respective hospitals, and that the Commonwealth Court erred in regarding them as hospitals; they urge that the court’s conclusion they are not institutions of higher education is contrary to both the stipulations of counsel and the findings of the PHEAA and is inconsistent with the PHEAA’s approval of them as institutions of higher education whose students may be eligible for state scholarship assistance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>Plainly the purpose of the IAGA is to provide direct institutional assistance, not to all institutions of higher education located in Pennsylvania, but only to “eligible” institutions as defined in the statute. One of the definitional requirements is that the institution in question be chartered. It is well-settled that a chartered institution derives its legal existence and identity from its charter, and that its fundamental nature is to be ascertained from the nature of its charter. See, e. g., <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em><a href="/us/17/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="17 U.S. 518" data-case-ids="4697" data-case-paths="/us/17/0518-01">17 U.S. 518</a>, <a href="/us/17/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="17 U.S. 518" data-case-ids="4697" data-case-paths="/us/17/0518-01">4 Wheat. 518</a>, <a href="/us/17/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="17 U.S. 518" data-case-ids="4697" data-case-paths="/us/17/0518-01">4 L.Ed. 629</a> (1819). It is thus reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended the PHEAA to consider the nature of the institutional charter in determining whether the institution actually receiving this direct institutional assistance is indeed an institution of higher education. Since the primary aim of the IAGA is to assist not students but educational institutions which meet the statutory requirements for eligibility, even though, the amount of assistance paid to each eligible institution is based upon the number of Pennsylvania State scholarship students attending, it is immaterial that for scholarship purposes the PHEAA has approved the nursing schools in question as institutions of higher education. Students may and do receive State scholarships while attending institutions of their choice plainly ineligible for IAGA assistance, including institutions outside the Commonwealth; the primary purpose of such scholarships is to aid students, not institutions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Los Angeles County, <a href="/cal-2d/25/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="25 Cal. 2d 254" data-case-ids="2231225" data-case-paths="/cal-2d/25/0254-01">25 </a></em><a href="/cal-2d/25/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="25 Cal. 2d 254" data-case-ids="2231225" data-case-paths="/cal-2d/25/0254-01">Cal.2d 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20P.2d%20341" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="153 P.2d 341">153 P.2d 341</a> (1944). At issue in that case was whether a hospital which operated a nursing school qualified for a property-tax exemption granted by the California Constitution to “any educational institution of collegiate grade.” The Constitution did not define “educational institution of collegiate grade,” but in the state tax code the legislature defined it <em>inter alia </em>as “an institution incorporated as a college or seminary of learning under the laws of this State.” The hospital argued that this legislative limitation was unconstitutional, but the Court, rejecting this contention, stated:</p>

The record reveals that this legislation was originally drafted for legislative consideration by counsel for intervening appellee, the PACU, and reviewed by PHEAA’s executive director. Subsequently, the legislative staff asked the executive director to prepare a preliminary list of institutions which might be eligible for assistance together with estimates as to the amount of assistance each institution might receive. The preliminary list contained only two and four-year colleges and contained no schools of nursing whatsoever. The legislative debates on the proposed measure in both houses of the General Assembly referred only to colleges and universities and not to schools of nursing. Further, uncontradicted testimony at the administrative hearing indicated that if nursing schools had been regarded as independent institutions of higher education, the state and national percentages of students attending such institutions would have been different from the 42% and 24% figures contained in the “Legislative Findings” in section 2(a) of the IAGA, 24 P.S. § 5182(a), supra.

Pursuant to this responsibility, the agency sent questionnaires to various schools of nursing which had expressed an interest in participating in the program, including those operated by appellants.

In my view, the distinction between appellants and the comparable institutions found eligible for IAGA assistance is reasonable and rests upon a ground of difference which has a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. As indicated above, the object of the IAGA is to provide <em>direct </em>institutional assistance to independent institutions of higher education located and chartered in Pennsylvania. It is thus reasonable for the PHEAA, empowered by the legislature to determine which institutions are eligible to share in the limited funds appropriated for IAGA assistance,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> to look to the nature of the institutional charter to determine whether the institution which would actually receive and control the funds is itself an institution of higher education. Although the nursing schools operated by appellants unquestionably perform a valuable educational function in the Commonwealth, the pertinent distinction is not between eligible and ineligible nursing schools but between eligible and ineligible institutions, and I conclude that the distinction between appellants and those institutions found eligible for IAGA assistance reasonably and substantially fulfills the statutory purpose of providing direct assistance to independent institutions of higher education.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Although there plainly are substantial <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>similarities between appellants and some institutions found eligible for assistance, it is well-settled that a legislative classification need not be perfect and may result in some practical inequalities so long as some reasonable basis exists for the classification.

It defines “approved institution of higher learning” simply as “any institution of higher learning approved by the agency.” 24 P.S. § 5153(2). In contrast, section 3 of the IAGA strictly limits, by its definition of “eligible institution,” agency approval of institutions for IAGA assistance.

For example, the record makes it clear that in the case of the University of Pennsylvania, it is the parent institution, the university, which receives the assistance grant, not the nursing school. Similarly, if appellants were found eligible, the hospitals would receive the grants rather than their respective nursing schools. Appellants argue that this distinction is immaterial because section 6 of the IAGA, 24 P.S. § 5186, requires eligible institutions to keep their IAGA funds in a separate account and to utilize them only for expenses connected with educational cost. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to conclude that hospital nursing schools operating only under a hospital charter are operated mainly for the benefit of and incidental to the operation of the hospitals. In light of IAGA’s purpose of provid<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>ing direct assistance to independent institutions of higher education, it is not unreasonable to distinguish nursing schools not separately chartered which are subservient to parent institutions whose primary purpose is other rhan education. In my view, the statutory accounting requirement thus does not eliminate the danger of “institutional entanglements” noted by the Commonwealth Court as a reasonable basis for the distinction. 24 Pa.Cmwlth. at 359, 356 A.2d at 841.</p>
