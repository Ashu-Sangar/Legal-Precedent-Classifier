This similarity was discovered by the police officers on February 17, 1976, the day before the warrants were issued. Testimony given at the suppression hearing establishes that state troopers, suspicious of appellant’s possible connection with the victim and possible involvement in the homicide, decided to locate appellant’s two vehicles and compare the tires with the photographs of the imprints found at the murder site. Aware that appellant’s daughter often drove one of the vehicles to her high school and usually parked in the parking lot, the officers drove to the parking lot and there observed the vehicle registered to Mrs. Mangini.

Therefore, the composite picture, and its resemblance to appellant, could not supply probable cause for the view of the tires made on the 17th. Without the composite pictures, appellant contends there was no probable cause for the “search” of the 17th because the other reasons listed in the search warrants were either speculative, conclusory or were applicable to numerous other people in the general area of the homicide.

The facts leading to the petition for this writ are as follows: There were three suppression hearings held in this case. At the first on April 2, 1976, one of the investigating officers, Harry Jabo, testified that he believed the viewing of the car registered to Mrs. Mangini in the parking lot of her daughter’s school took place on February 16, 1976. At the suppression hearing held on May 3, 1976, it was established that the actual date of this viewing was on February 17, 1976. Officer Jabo testified that the reason for his previously giving February 16th as the viewing date was that he had testified at the first hearing from memory and that after consulting with the other investigators and their notes, the viewing had, in fact, taken place on the 17th. Three other investigating officers also testified at the May 3rd hearing that the viewing took place on the 17th.

The records subpoenaed did not contain any reference to the viewing of the Mangini vehicle at their daughter’s school. This fact, claims appellant, suggests that Officer Jabo deliberately misled the court at the second hearing in stating at that time that he had concluded the proper viewing date was the 17th of February based on his conference with the other investigators and their notes.</p>

    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[191,1321,1147,896]]]'>It is also generally accepted that the granting of a petition for such extraordinary relief is not proper unless the extrinsic facts were not only not discovered at the time of trial, but also not discoverable by the petitioner at such time by the exercise of due diligence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/351/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="351 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="462727" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0325-01">351 Pa. at 327</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20688" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="41 A.2d 688">41 A.2d at 691</a>; <em>Commonwealth v. Matthews, </em><a href="/pa/356/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="356 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="470703" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0100-01">356 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20609" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="51 A.2d 609">51 A.2d 609</a> (1947); 10A P.L.E. Criminal Law § 852. Appellant maintains that he exercised all due diligence in this matter. Yet he did not make any attempt to secure the investigative notes referred to at the hearing on May 3, 1976 until the filing of the motion for subpoena duces tecum on December 6, 1976. This is hardly due diligence. Appellant was aware on May 3rd of the possibility that certain notes or reports might prove illuminating. Yet he made no effort to procure them for some seven months — some five months following the conclusion of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[192,2258,1145,96]],["BL_204.1",204,[263,308,1150,689]]]'>As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Harris, supra, </em>“when a party seeks to avail himself of [the writ of error <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>coram nobis], he must show that it was by no fault or negligence of his that the error in fact assigned was not made to appear at the former trial.” <a href="/pa/351/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="351 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="462727" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0325-01">351 Pa. at 329</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20688" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="41 A.2d 688">41 A.2d at 691</a>. Here, appellant has utterly failed to meet his requirement. The motion to subpoena the police records could have been filed at any time after May 3, 1976, when appellant became aware that the records might be useful. He asserts no reason for the seven month delay prior to the filing of the motion. Hence, the denial of the petition for the writ of error coram nobis was proper. Finally, we note that official records are not necessarily the same as investigative notes. Therefore, it would be fallacious to conclude that there was necessarily an inconsistency.</p>
