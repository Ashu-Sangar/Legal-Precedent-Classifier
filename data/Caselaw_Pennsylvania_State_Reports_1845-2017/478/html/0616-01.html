    <p class="author" id="b657-12" data-blocks='[["BL_657.11",657,[255,1527,290,33]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b657-13" data-blocks='[["BL_657.12",657,[210,1592,1146,357]]]'>Appellant, after waiving a jury trial, was tried in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, and was found guilty of murder in the third degree and possession of an instrument of crime. Post-verdict motions were heard and denied and appellant was sentenced. In appealing the trial court’s judgment of murder in the third degree, appellant seeks a new trial.</p>

Appellant’s first contention is without merit and appellant’s <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>second contention has been waived because the issue was not raised at trial.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[312,435,611,43]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
