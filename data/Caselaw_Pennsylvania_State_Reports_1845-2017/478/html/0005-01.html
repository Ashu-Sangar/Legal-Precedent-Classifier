Ehrlich, who has not been a party in any of the appeals, joined appellee-husband as an additional defendant, alleging that Mr. Policino was either solely or jointly liable to his wife. On March 13, 1973, a jury found that appellee-husband was solely liable to his wife for $10,000. Mr. Policino filed <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>neither a motion for a new trial nor for judgment n. o. v.

In December of 1973, Mr. Policino instituted proceedings in Montgomery County to strike the judgment as not in accordance with the Pennsylvania inter-spousal immunity law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This statute, however, does not bar an original defendant from joining a husband as an additional defendant; rather, it precludes a wife’s recovery from her spouse. <em>Daly v.

No post-verdict motions were filed, nor was a direct appeal taken from the judgment entered in Montgomery County in April, 1973. We believe that Mr. Policino’s inaction in failing to file any post-verdict motions or to appeal the judgment entered on the verdict precludes any collateral attack of such judgment in either Erie or Montgomery Counties.
