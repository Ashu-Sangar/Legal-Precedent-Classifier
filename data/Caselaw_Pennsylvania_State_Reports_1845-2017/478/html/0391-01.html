Post-verdict motions were denied and he was sentenced to a prison term of two-to-six years. This direct appeal followed. On November 24, 1976, this court remanded the case to the court below for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/pa/469/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="469 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1722100" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0357-01">469 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="469 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1722100" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0357-01">365 A.2d 1244</a> (1976).

On October 13, the pair had an argument and appellant slapped his wife in the face, causing a bruise in the area of her left jaw. On October 15, she moved into the home of her daughter and on October 21, was taken to a hospital, where a Dr. Kresge observed bruises on her jaw and chest. At the time, she was complaining of dizziness, headaches and general weakness. A neurological examina<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>tion proved normal, and Dr. Kresge attributed her problems to high blood pressure, a disease from which she had been suffering for over ten years. Dr. Kresge discharged Daisy Smith to her daughter’s care.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[270,534,1146,784]]]'>On October 24, Daisy Smith was admitted to the hospital in a semi-conscious state. She died on October 27, 1973. An autopsy was performed the next day, and the cause of death was determined to be a subdural hematoma, a blood clot on the brain. Dr. Gochoco, a pathologist, testified that the injury was traumatic in origin. He further testified that considerable force was necessary to cause an injury of that nature. Dr. Gochoco found a bruise in the left temple area and testified that the bruise may have been consistent with the clot. Under cross examination, Dr. Gochoco testified that in his opinion, .the injury causing the clot had to have happened on October 14 or thereafter. The Commonwealth then called Dr. Malina, a neurosurgeon, who, after reviewing the victim’s hospital records, testified that the clot could have been caused by an injury as early as October 1, 1973.</p>
