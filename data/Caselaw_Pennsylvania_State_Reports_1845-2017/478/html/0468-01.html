The witness was asked what he expected to discover from questioning appellant. Appellant objected to the question and the trial court sustained his objection, thereby granting all the relief requested by appellant. Appellant failed to move for a mistrial; therefore, he cannot now complain that the court erred in failing to grant a mistrial when no such motion was made. <em>Commonwealth v.
