He was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder, and ten-to-twenty years each for burglary and robbery, all sentences to run consecutively. The prosecution entered a nolle prosequi on the conspiracy conviction. Appellant filed post-verdict motions which were denied on Sept. 6, 1973 and no direct appeal was taken. On November 3, 1975, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. After a hearing, appellant was permitted to file appeals nunc pro tunc from the judgments of sentence imposed. He <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>then appealed the judgment of sentence on the murder conviction to this court. He also appealed the judgments of sentence for burglary and robbery to the Superior Court, which certified those appeals to this court.</p>

    <p id="b133-8" data-blocks='[["BL_133.8",133,[200,739,1149,735]]]'>I disagree with the Court’s refusal to find the appellant’s confession involuntary due to protracted questioning. Appellant was taken into custody at 4:20 a. m. and the confession was not completed until over twenty-four hours later. The Court should examine fully the psychologically coercive circumstances surrounding the appellant’s confession. The United States Supreme Court has stated “[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will . . . <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, 469, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, 1625, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d 694</a>, 721 (1966). The Court today ignores the psychological manipulation of the appellant by the police; a confession elicited in such a way is surely riot voluntary, under the totality of the circumstances. I therefore dissent.</p>
