    <p id="b143-12" data-blocks='[["BL_143.11",143,[146,1500,1148,626]]]'>The facts are as follows. James Allen was beaten and shot on February 28, 1971 at 1:15 a. m.; he was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Joseph’s Hospital, Philadelphia. Among the victim’s personal effects was a Pennsylvania automobile owner’s registration card in the name of appellant. Wideman was contacted by police and voluntarily went to police headquarters, with his wife, at approximately 5:00 a. m. on February 28. The police found blood on appellant’s dark colored Buick Electra 225, a car similar to the one driven by the victim’s assailant. Appellant was warned of his constitutional rights and subsequently gave an oral and a written confession.</p>

On the question as to what evidence must be considered as obtained as a direct result of an unlawful invasion, and so excluded, the Court said, in a frequently quoted passage: ‘We need not hold that all evidence is “fruit of the poisonous tree” simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.

In reviewing this finding, we must consider only the Commonwealth’s evidence and the uncontradicted evidence of appellant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and determine if the court’s finding is supported by the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

If the weapon was not found, police would attempt to retrace a defendant’s steps by taking the most direct route between the scene of the crime and the defendant’s residence, searching sewers, vacant lots and empty houses along the way. The Commonwealth argues that the evidence showed that the gun in question would have been found in such a manner, thus dissipating the taint of the illegal confession. We do not agree.</p>

When given these facts, Detective Basmajian was asked which route the police originally would have searched using the standard procedure. Detective Basmajian testified that since appellant’s residence was at 2762 N. Ringgold Street he would have traveled east on Jefferson to 18th Street, turning north until he intersected with whatever street runs east and west near the 2700 block of North Ringgold.

In gang killings guns are either thrown up on roofs or inlets, those two places, and I think this plan that this detective testified to would have been a reasonable one, to say let’s take Gratz Street and take an area of five or six blocks all the way around, that would be reasonable. <em>If I was a detective that is what I would do. </em>A suspect does not necessarily run a direct route home.
