Appellant’s arrest was premised on his alleged participation in the homicide of Clinton Dunn, Jr., of Aiken County, South Carolina. See § 13 of the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1941, P.L. 288, § 1, et seq., 19 P.S. § 191.1, et seq. Appellant was preliminarily arraigned and a “thirty day” hearing, as required by § 15 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, <em>supra, </em>was scheduled for May 19, 1975. Appellant was ordered detained in the Philadelphia Detention Center. On April 30, appellant’s counsel filed a petition to transfer appellant to Pennypack House, a juvenile facility, in light of appellant’s age — seventeen.</p>

On May 13, the petition to transfer to Pennypack House was granted, but the petition to transfer to the Family Division was denied. On May 19, pursuant to § 15 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, appellant appeared in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia; however, no Governor’s Warrant had been received and, therefore, a thirty-day continuance was granted on June 18, 1975. Appellant again appeared in court and a second thirty-day continuance was granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On July 18,1975, appellant was “arrested” pursuant to a Governor’s Warrant from the State of South Carolina. On July 30, 1975, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On September 16, 1975, the petition for a writ of <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>habeas corpus was denied and appellant was ordered extradited to South Carolina. On September 17, 1975, appellant appealed the extradition to the Superior Court, and also filed a petition for supersedeas. On October 3, 1975, Superi- or Court granted appellant’s petition for supersedeas, pending disposition of his appeal. On November 22, 1976, the Superior Court affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, which ordered extradition. On March 29, 1977, this court granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[214,861,1148,463]]]'>Appellant argues that the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that the demand for extradition and supporting documents from the demanding state demonstrates the existence of probable cause to believe that the alleged fugitive committed the crime charged.
