Post-verdict motions were denied. A sentence of life imprisonment was imposed for murder, and a consecutive sentence of five to ten years was imposed for criminal conspiracy. The judgment of sentence for murder was appealed to this Court, and the judgment of sentence for criminal conspiracy was appealed to the Superi- or Court, which certified the appeal to this Court.

She discovered a large cooking knife and bloody paper towels on the kitchen countertop, and at the same time heard the victim calling faintly from the basement. Upon going down to the basement, the mother found the victim lying in a pool of blood w'ith numerous stab wounds to her right arm, chest and throat. In answer to her mother’s question as to w’hat caused her injuries, the victim clearly and repeatedly named the appellant and two of appellant’s regular companions. The mother’s co-worker came down the stairs and heard the same three people named as the assailants.</p>

The senior police officer found the victim in a severely wounded state and heard her say repeatedly that she was dying. When questioned, she replied, “They stabbed me.” She also stated there had been three assailants. The police officer then grabbed the nearest available thing to write on, a napkin. The victim gave him the same three names she had given her mother, and told the officer they were all Muslims who lived in Frank-ford and belonged to the Susquehanna Mosque. The officer wrote this information in abbreviated form on the napkin. After taking the victim to the hospital, the officer showed the names on the napkin to another policeman. Seeing appellant’s name, the other officer said he knew where appellant lived. When the police went to the address supplied by the officer, they were given another address by appellant’s parents. Arriving at that destination, they apprehended appellant as he ran to get into a car.</p>

The caller identified himself as “Louis” and asked for Linda DeBose, the victim. The witness further testified that she recognized the voice as that of Louis Riggins, whom she knew from having spoken to him before, both in person and by telephone. At the end of the telephone conversation, Linda DeBose, the victim, told Rose DeBose, “Louis will be over later on.” When the sister left the house at 9:30 p. m. she locked the door. The door had two locks and a peephole. She testified that they always kept the door locked and admitted no one unless identified. She returned to the house at 11:45 p. m., after the police had taken the victim to the hospital. There was no sign of forcible entry. Rose DeBose further testified that three nights before the stabbing she observed Linda in their home along with appellant and one of the other named assailants. The other individual and Linda were engaged in an angry argument.</p>

      <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>The first contention relates to the dying declarations made by the victim. Appellant concedes that these declarations were clearly admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. He argues, however, that the dying declarations were the only testimony identifying him as the perpetrator of the act and that these declarations constitute insufficient evidence as a matter of law unless corroborated by other evidence linking him directly to the crimes. The requirement of corroboration for dying declarations is not in accordance with the law of this jurisdiction. The credibility, interpretation and weight to be given a dying declaration under the attendant facts and circumstances of the case, are matters exclusively for the jury. <em>Commonwealth v.

The solemnity of an occasion in which the declarant is conscious of the imminence of death justifies giving the dying declaration the same weight as sworn testimony. The reliability accorded a sworn statement springs from the declarant’s appreciation of the significance of the oath. In the case of the dying declaration the awareness of impending death provides the assurance of the truthfulness of the utterance. <em>Accord, </em>McCormick on Evidence § 286 (2nd ed. 1972).</p>

Appellant does not argue that there was a serious dispute at trial as to the fact that these accusations were leveled against appellant by the victim. Indeed, independent of the napkin, Mrs. DeBose, the victim’s mother, Mr. Young and Officer Fiedler all testified as to hearing the victim state that her injuries were caused by appellant. The real controversy centered upon the truthfulness of these accusations. The physical presence of the napkin could in no way lend credence to the verity of the victim’s charges. Thus, since any emphasis that may have resulted from the trial court’s ruling related to an issue not seriously disputed, we cannot say that the court’s action amounted to an abuse of discretion requiring a reversal of the judgments of sentence.</p>

Appellant contends that this testimony was hearsay and improperly admitted. It is argued that the only purpose for the admis<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>sion of the evidence was to establish the truth of the remark that appellant would be at the home of the deceased later that evening. If, in fact, this was the purpose of the challenged evidence, then appellant would be correct in his assertion that this evidence would represent a classic example of hearsay evidence. However, we are satisfied that this evidence was admissible to show the state of mind of the victim, evidencing her intent to remain at the house and her willingness to admit him. This testimony was particularly crucial in view of the evidence that the house was kept secured and that persons would not be admitted unless known to the occupants. Further, the evidence established an absence of forcible entrance which would tend to prove that the victim knew and freely admitted the intruder or intruders who caused her death. In short,.this testimony provided a basis for permitting the jury to conclude appellant had the opportunity to commit the crime in question.</p>
