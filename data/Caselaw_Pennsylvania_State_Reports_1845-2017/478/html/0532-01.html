Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 13.02 (1958)). Nothing in the record demonstrates that Giffen performed anything more than a perfunctory act when he signed and issued the citation against American Bankers. American Bankers has not demonstrated that the Department of Insurance is organized in such a way that Giffen held authority, as in <em>Dussia, </em>to prosecute. Nor does any statute or regulation relating to the operation of the Department support such a conclusion. To the contrary, by statute, only the Commissioner of Insurance has that authority. Act of June 11, 1947, P.L. 551, §§ 13(d), 16, 40 P.S. §§ 1233(d), 1236(a) (1971). Thus, the majority’s reliance upon <em>Dussia v.

Appellee’s contention fails for the reasons set forth in Part I of this opinion. Appellee alleges, without support in the record, that a commingling of functions occurred creating an appearance of impropriety prohibited by due process. As in <em>Feeser, </em>appellee has not demonstrated that the Department’s prosecuting attorney engaged in any improper conduct with Giffen. Consequently, where such evidence is absent, Giffen’s previous supervisory responsibilities cannot establish a violation of due process. See <em>Withrow v.

It casts doubt over the ability of administrative agencies to perform the duties with which they have been entrusted by the Legislature. It ignores the presumption of <em>Withrow v.

Finally, it nullifies what in every respect appears to be a valid agency disposition. I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Department of Insurance.</p>

The language to that effect, however, was dictum. Moreover, the opinion does not indicate how closely connected the adjudicator had been to the investigation, the extent of his duties while in the department, the interval that passed between his membership in the department and his participation on the Civil Service Commission or any other fact which may have impelled the court’s conclusion. <em>Gardner, </em>which based its dictum on the concept that due process prohibits the mere “appearance of bias," also appears contrary to <em>Withrow v.
