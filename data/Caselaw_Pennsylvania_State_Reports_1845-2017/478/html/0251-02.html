In appellant’s second trial there was no declaration of a mistrial over appellant’s objection; rather, appellant himself several times moved for a mistrial, and the motions were denied. It was later determined by the lower court en banc that a new trial was necessary because appellant’s constitutional right to a fair trial, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

The injection of his personal opinion as to her reliability as a witness was an intrusion into the jury’s province of determining the credibility of the witnesses. Furthermore, the prejudicial nature of this intrusion was compounded by the weakness of the foundation on which Mr. Stevens’s opinion was based.

That one exception occurred during a highly suggestive situation in which she stated that appellant, who was seated between his two attorneys at the defendant’s table in court, was the one who shot Sinnamon. We have condemned unnecessarily suggestive procedures like this as unreliable, and have refused to allow the jury to hear evidence of such identifications unless the prosecution first shows that the witness’s identification is reliably based on observations made at the scene of the crime, and therefore has a basis independent from the suggestive confrontation. <em>Comm. v. </em>Fowler, <a href="/pa/466/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="241" data-cite="466 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1715002" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0198-01">466 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="242" data-cite="466 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1715002" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0198-01">352 A.2d 17</a> (1976).

Thus, the prosecutor’s action conformed with the applicable discovery rules promulgated by this Court. While mechanical reliance on a rule may prove to be unjustified in a particular case if competing constitutional requirements are paramount, we do not believe that the Commonwealth’s reliance on Ruie 310 was totally unreasonable in these circumstances.

It was closed and so they waited. Minutes later, a customer, Marjorie Anthony, arrived and knocked at the door. The deceased answered the door and, at her request, sold her a quantity of sausage. As she turned to leave, defendant, who was standing nearby, pulled out the pistol, shoved the deceased into the store and fired. The woman screamed and ran to a nearby house. At the sound of the screams, defendant fled from the scene and proceeded to a bar located at Fifty-Second Street and Lancaster Avenue. Entering the bar he inquired whether anyone would want to purchase the pistol and found a willing buyer in Charles Carter. Five days later, the pistol was seized by police when Carter was stopped for a motor vehicle violation. He was taken into custody for the Sinnamon murder but, wh~n police investigated and confirmed his account of the transaction, he was released.

The appellant also complains that “by his words and conduct, [the trial judge] entered the case as an advocate for the prosecution,” (Brief at p. 2) that certain inflammatory remarks by the prosecutor in his closing address require reversal, and that a statement made by the defendant should have been suppressed as involuntary or as the product of unnecessary delay in arraignment. Our review of the record satisfies us that these claims are without merit.</p>

Appellant contends that this asserted error has so added to the taint of prior errors as to result in a denial of “fundamental'fairness and due process of law”, Brief at 6, and that this Court, “in exercise of its supervisory authority over the administration of the criminal justice system,” .Brief at 13, should dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Since we find that there was no error in the third trial, we necessarily reject this contention. In addition, we note that the due process interest to which appellant points is itself informed by the interests involved in the Double Jeopardy Clause, see <em>Lee v.
