The three girls disappeared the evening of July 19, 1973. On October 6, 1974, their bodies were discovered in a wooded area near Shamokin.

They took them to a spot near the site where the bodies were found. When they had been there for a time, an argument broke out, which led to violence. The girls were killed at Yost’s suggestion. Yost himself strangled Sharon Long. The bodies were taken to the spot where they were found, which was in a wooded ravine, and left there.

The trial judge admitted a single black and white photograph of a skeleton at the grave site. It was not bloody, nor was it obvious from the photograph that any violence had occurred. Anyone who did not examine it carefully might not be aware at all that it depicted human <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>remains. The skeleton does not appear so prominently as to be readily identifiable without a close look. A human skull is discernible, however, if a close examination is made. The photograph should not be viewed as particularly inflammatory. By providing an example of how the bodies were situated at the grave site, it illustrated what happened to the victims, thereby aiding in understanding the alleged crime.

Appellant argues that it was a proper question because it had a bearing on Patti’s credibility. The purpose was to show that Patti was not mentally stable at the time that Yost allegedly admitted to him that he killed the victims. If Patti’s mental condition at that time had been impaired so as to affect his ability to remember what he saw or heard, evidence as to his condition would be relevant. <em>Commonwealth v.

After the objection to the disallowed question was sustained, appellant was permitted to question Patti on his use of drugs at the particular time of the alleged admission. Patti said that at the time he was taking Proloxin, a tranquilizer prescribed for a nervous condition, and was not taking heroin, cocaine, or Tolwyn, a synthetic form of morphine. Having been allowed to ask such questions, appellant was not denied any right that he had to attempt to impeach on the basis of drug use. The disallowed question would have brought out any drug problem that Patti might have had at an irrelevant time and was, therefore, properly excluded.</p>

The matter was discussed thoroughly with Yost, who agreed that the motion should be made. Counsel abandoned the idea after the denial of a motion by Roland Scandle for a change of venue in his trial.

I should think that these characteristics of the exhibit are answer enough to any assertion, such as that made by Mr. Justice Manderino in dissent, that photographs of human remains must be deemed inflammatory <em>per se. </em>The majority, however, places reliance on its appraisal that “[t]he photograph should not be viewed as particularly inflammatory.” <em>Ante </em>at 337. In making this statement the majority seems to overlook the fact that the <em>Petrakovich </em>test consists of two steps, <em>viz., </em>determining whether a photograph proffered as an exhibit is inflammatory or not, and, if it is, proceeding to determine whether it has such evidentiary value that its “need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jury.” <em>Petrakovich, </em>supra, 459 Pa. at 521, 329 A.2d at 852, quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Instead, the majority seems to be saying that a photograph’s evidentiary value is to be balanced in each case against various subtle gradations of inflammatory potential.

Once again the majority finds no error in admitting such photographs. Although I have already expressed the view that recent decisions of this Court make it difficult to construct a case where a new trial is granted because of the admission of inflammatory photographs, <em>Commonwealth v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">472 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">371 A .2d 468</a>, 497 501 (1977) (Manderino &amp; Roberts, JJ., concurring and dissenting), I must express my dismay and disagreement with the reasoning employed by the majority in this case.</p>

The majority is forced to conclude that the photograph is inflammatory, although it does so reluctantly, stating that the photograph is not “particularly inflammatory.” Even under the test a majority of this Court adopted in <em>Commonwealth v. Petrakovich, </em><a href="/pa/459/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="459 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="481013" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0511-01">459 Pa. 511</a>, 521, <a href="/pa/459/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="459 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="481013" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0511-01">329 A.2d 844</a>, 849 (1974), a standard with which I continue to disagree, the pictures are therefore inadmissible unless <em>“of such essential evidentiary value that their need </em>
      <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>
      <em>clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jury.” </em>(Emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[256,410,1147,1004]]]'>By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that this photograph had “essential evidentiary value.” The majority holds this photograph admissible because it “[provided] an example of how the bodies were situated at the gravesite, [and] illustrated what happened to the victims, thereby aiding in understanding the alleged crime.” The flimsiness of this purported relevance is self-apparent. A skeleton cannot possibly illustrate “what happened to the victims.” Death was by strangulation, and I am at a loss to understand how a skeleton can illustrate strangulation. I am also at an utter loss to comprehend the relevance of “how the bodies were situated.” There is absolutely no issue in this case even remotely related to the situation of the victims’ bodies. Not only was this photograph lacking in “essential evidentiary value,” this photograph had no relevance whatsoever. Under any test ever articulated by this Court for reviewing a trial court’s discretion in admitting photographs of corpses, to admit this photograph was an abuse of that discretion. I dissent.</p>
