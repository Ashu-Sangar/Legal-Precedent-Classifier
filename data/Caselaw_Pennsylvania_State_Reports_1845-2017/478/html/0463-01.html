    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[231,647,1146,191]]]'>In this case, like <em>St. Joe, </em>there is no express grant of authority to award damages, but, unlike <em>St. Joe, </em>that authority is <em>necessarily implied </em>in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[230,866,1146,250]]]'>In 1974, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission Act was amended and a new subsection (c) was added to section 962 of the Act. This new subsection, in my opinion, <em>necessarily implies </em>that the Commission has the authority to award damages. The new subsection (c) reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AgX" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[272,1128,1106,1229]]]'>“(c) In cases involving a claim of discrimination, <em>if a complainant invokes the procedures set forth in this act, that individual’s right of action in the courts of the Commonwealth shall not be foreclosed. If </em>within one (1) year after the filing of a complaint with the Commission, <em>the Commission dismisses the complaint or has not entered into a conciliation agreement to </em>which the complainant is a party, the Commission must so notify the complainant. On receipt of such a notice the complainant shall be able to bring an action in the courts of common pleas of the Commonwealth based on the right to freedom from discrimination granted by this act. If the court finds that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice charged in the complaint, the court shall enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful discriminatory practice and order affirmative action which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employes, granting of back pay, <em>or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. </em>Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than three years prior to the filing of a complaint charging violations of this act.” (Emphasis added.) As amended 1974, Dec. 19, P.L. 966, No. 318, § 6, imd. effective.</blockquote>

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>It can be seen from the above subsection that a person who does not receive relief from the Commission is entitled to bring an action in the courts of common pleas of the Commonwealth and the court is entitled to award any legal or equitable relief it deems appropriate.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[213,615,1148,1120]]]'>There is nothing in the Act to indicate a legislative intent that the courts would be able to give a remedy which the Commission could not give in the first instance. If a person is entitled to an award of damages in the court, the Commission should be able to make a similar award. If this were not so, the legislative intent that the agency with expertise in the area of discrimination be the initial forum for the consideration of discrimination complaints would be considerably thwarted. A person claiming discrimination might not diligently cooperate in the procedures before the Human Relations Commission if that person could obtain more relief before the courts than before the Commission. Therefore, when one considers a court of common pleas’ express authority to award damages as a remedy for unlawful discrimination, as well as the clear legislative intent that parties who suffer from discrimination seek and obtain recourse from the Human Relations Commission, I think it necessarily implied in the PHRA that the Commission, empowered to “take such affirmative action . . . [to] effectuate the purposes of [the Human Relations Act],” 43 P.S. § 959, be allowed to award damages in an appropriate case.</p>
