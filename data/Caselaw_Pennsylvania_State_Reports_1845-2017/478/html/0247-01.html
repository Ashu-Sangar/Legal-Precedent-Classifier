The petition appeared to be in order except that in the body of the introduction to the petition, appellant erroneously stated that the petition <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>was for the “189th” congressional district rather than for the “1st” congressional district.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[223,462,1147,461]]]'>On March 10, 1978, appellant received a letter from the Commissioner of Elections stating that said petition was rejected because the petition, by erroneously stating that it was for the “189th” congressional district rather than the “1st” congressional district, contained a “material error”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The letter advised appellant he could file a mandamus action in Commonwealth Court. Accompanying the letter was the petition which appellant had earlier submitted to the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[223,945,1147,354]]]'>Appellant attempted to secure judicial relief from a Philadelphia Municipal Court judge wherein the judge drew two lines through the numerals “189th” as they appeared on the petition and inserted in print the word “First”. Appellant attempted to file the corrected petition with the Secretary of the Commonwealth; however, the petition was again rejected.</p>
    <p id="b289-7" data-blocks='[["BL_289.6",289,[222,1322,1148,464]]]'>Appellant then filed a complaint in mandamus in Commonwealth Court, seeking an order from said court directing the Secretary of the Commonwealth to accept his nomination petition as if timely filed and to place his name on the ballot in the 1978 primary election as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for representative to the United States Congress from the first congressional district. Commonwealth Court dismissed appellant’s complaint. Appellant now appeals that dismissal.</p>

Since appellant’s error was not “material”, the Secretary of the Commonwealth should have accepted appellant’s nomination petition.</p>
