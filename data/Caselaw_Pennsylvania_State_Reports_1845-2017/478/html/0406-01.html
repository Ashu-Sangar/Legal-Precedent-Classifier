The facts surrounding this case are: Ruth and George Gustin, who resided near the Garcias in Way-mart, Pennsylvania, were awakened in their home by a loud noise between 4:00 and 5:00 a. m. on August 10, 1973. They saw a light burning a short distance away but investigated no further, thinking nothing was wrong. At approximately 7:30 that morning, Ruth Gustin and Ruth Wenk, a neighbor, left for work. They found that a car had gone off the road and down a hill near the Gustin home. They looked and found what appeared to be the remains of a human skeleton behind the driver’s seat. They called the police, who investigated, along with the Wayne County Coroner, and had the car examined and various tests performed on the remains and bone fragments found therein. It was determined that the ear belonged to Senen Garcia and that the body was Garcia’s. The investigation further revealed that the car had been doused with gasoline and set on fire, burning the body, but Garcia was dead before the fire.</p>

Rolison was convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Senen Garcia’s death. Brooks and Lamberton pleaded guilty to participating in the murder and testified against appellant at her trial. Their testimony was that the four had planned the murder for some time, motivated by appellant’s desire to end her marriage, and that their plan was carried out the evening of August 9, 1973 and the morning of tne 10th in the following manner: appellant and Brooks, at the Garcia home, put sleeping pills in some beer that the decedent was to drink. The decedent subse<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>quently went to his bedroom and went to sleep. Lamberton and Rolison then went to the house. Rolison struck the decedent in the head several times with a spike. Satisfied that he was dead, Lamberton and Rolison took his body and put it behind the wheel of his car on top of the hill above the spot where it was discovered. They doused the car with gasoline, set it on fire, and pushed it off, hoping that the incident would appear to be accidental.</p>

On December 4, 1973, after the appointment of counsel, bail was requested and fixed, and appellant was released. She contends that this seventy-day delay hindered the preparation of her defense; however, she makes no specific allegations of prejudice that resulted from the delay. Having articulated no specific prejudice, we find'appellant’s contention meritless.</p>

We do not agree. The trial court, accepting appellant’s claim of entitlement to appointed counsel, appointed Marshall E. Anders on December 4, 1973. In response to Anders’ requests for additional help, the court appointed Hamilton C. Davis on March 5, 1974, and Mark B. Fox on April 26, 1974. The trial commenced on August 5, 1974, allowing eight months for preparation. Problems from late appointment of counsel are normally a result of appointment a short time before trial. Any resulting prejudice from a late appointment is curable by granting additional time. <em>U. S. ex rel Spears v.

The record in the instant case shows a similarly vigorous defense. Defense counsel were diligent in presenting objections and cross-examining witnesses during the Commonwealth’s case, and they also presented a comprehensive case of their own, calling fourteen witnesses, including appellant, and examining them extensively. They made numerous motions on behalf of their client, seeking to put in whatever evidence would help her on the record in the instant case. We are of the opinion that appellant’s claim of prejudice because of an allegedly late appointment of counsel is meritless.</p>

The trial judge, James Rutherford, appointed his son, Albert G. Rutherford, to represent appellant at the hearing. Appellant claims that her right to competent counsel was denied because attorney Rutherford was only appointed for the preliminary hearing. She claims that his appointment could only have been for the hearing because Judge Rutherford could not have presided at a trial at which his son was counsel. She asserts that a defendant cannot be represented by different counsel at the preliminary hearing and at trial. However, she does not cite, and we cannot find, any law to support that assertion. She makes no specific allegation of prejudice. To grant relief in this case, we would have to find that a change in counsel between the preliminary hearing and trial prevents competent representation from being provided. We do not so find. Counsel’s representation is presumed to be competent and the defendant has the burden to show otherwise. <em>Com. ex rel. Washington v.

The remark concerned the defense theory of the case. Appellant testified that on the night of her husband’s death he received a telephone call and then left their house without saying where he was going. She further testified that she heard nothing until the next day, when she was informed that a body believed, but not yet confirmed to be his, had been found. She stated that she had no knowledge of what had happened. The district attorney went over evidence that he said supported the Commonwealth’s version of the facts and refuted the appellant’s. He made the remark that brought on the defense objection while referring to the testimony of a witness, Albert Curtis, who said that during the evening of August 9, 1973, he saw appellant riding in a truck with Rolison and another person that he could not identify. The <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>district attorney said that it did not seem plausible that Brooks and Lamberton could have made up their story if appellant was seen as the witness testified he saw her. His words were: “This great plan these two kids have conjured up, they even arranged for him to see it. I think it is preposterous.” Appellant claims that the remark was intemperate so as to prejudice the jury when coupled with the court’s statement that “That is not objectionable.” We find no reversible error. A remark made by a prosecuting attorney does not necessarily require a new trial when it is intemperate, the trial court having discretion to determine whether such remarks are prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em><a href="/pa/432/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="432 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1919714" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0386-01">432 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20289" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="248 A.2d 289">248 A.2d 289</a> (1968).</p>

Take one <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>capsule at bedtime for sleep.” The vial was not admitted into evidence.</p>

Disbelief of the daughter’s testimony would have been particularly reasonable because the theory that the two men simply killed the victim while he was in a natural sleep would also have accounted for the murder. The vial of pills with appellant’s name on it was the only physical evidence indicating that appellant had access to the sleeping pills she allegedly placed in the victim’s beer. .</p>
