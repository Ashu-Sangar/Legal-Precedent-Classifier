St. Andrews claimed it had a leasing policy requiring tenants to have weekly earnings equaling a month’s rent and to provide supervision for young children on the premises. (R. 92a, 94a, 123a -124a). Evidence before the PHRC, however, supports the PHRC’s conclusion that this “policy” was nothing more than a vehicle for discrimination. (R. 55a -56a).</p>

The PHRC also heard testimony that persons in a financial condition similar to that of the Cobbs were not excluded as tenants on this basis. (R. 140a; see also R. 49a, 131a).</p>

(R. 93a -94a). Martha Cobb had a six year old child who would have lived in the apartment building. (R. 16a). St. Andrews did not inform the Cobbs of either its policy against admitting <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>tenants with unattended children or its exception to this policy.
