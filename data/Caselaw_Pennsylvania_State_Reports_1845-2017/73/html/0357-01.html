Bowen, déceased. The issue was framed November 10th 1871; William A. Goranflo, the executor named in the will, was plaintiff, and Thomas Bowen, who was husband of the decedent, was defendant. William Goranflo was brother of the decedent. The will was dated April 19th 1871, and gave all her property “ unto my child or children absolutely and for ever,” to be paid to the child or children at the age of twenty-one years, “but if they should die before they arrive at twenty-one years leaving no issue, then I direct that all my property shall go and be divided to and among my brother and sister,” &amp;c.</p>

He was both a devisee and the executor. It was admitted upon the argument, that if he had been the ex<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>ecutor only, he would have been competent under the exception to the proviso of the Act of 15th April 1869, Pamph. L. 30; but inasmuch as he was a devisee also, it was argued that he was incompetent. We are not able to see the force of the reasoning nor to adopt the conclusion. The language of the exception to the Act is to make parties competent “in issues and inquiries <em>devisavit vel non </em>and others, respecting the right of such deceased owner, between parties claiming such right by devolution on the death of such owner.”</p>
    <p id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[147,773,1165,514]]]'>This is an issue <em>devisavit vel non. </em>It is between parties claiming a right by devolution on the death of the former owner. The subject-matter is respecting the right so acquired. Thus the form of the suit, the parties thereto, and the subject-matter bring it within the exception. We see nothing in it to exclude a party who is either devisee or executor only. A union of two conditions of competency, each unquestioned by itself, will not create incompetency as its joint product. It follows that both parties claiming an estate, under the same decedent, which has devolved on them by descent or succession, are competent witnesses in the trial of an issue to settle their respective rights thereto: Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, 16 P. F. Smith 297.</p>
