Both <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>buildings rest for their support on this wall. The plaintiff’s builder accepted this party-wall and paid for it. He has used it to insert his own joists in. The foundation wall was right, but owing to want of skill, it has encroached several inches in different parts. Had this bill been filed immediately when the plaintiff knew or 'ought to have known the encroachment, and the defendant had gone on pending the bill, there would be both reason and authority for saying that he could be decreed to pull it down: Clark <em>v. </em>Martin, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20289" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Wright 289">13 Wright 289</a>. But here the wall was nearly finished before the bill was filed. No doubt a mandatory injunction may be granted on final hearing. But it certainly is not a matter of right. I may refer to Senior <em>v. </em>Pawson, L. R. 3 Eq. 330, where Y. Ch. Sir W. Page Wood considered it a circumstance entitled to great weight £ that damage to a much larger amount would be done by granting the mandatory injunction,’ and he adds: £ I do not think I ought to make a decree which would enable an extortionate price to be obtained for the injury sustained by the plaintiff. Seeing the time which has elapsed before any complaint was made, seeing also that the reasonable mode of doing justice between the parties is by a money compensation, I think that in fairness and in principle the power of the court should be so exercised as to give relief by damages instead of by injunction.’ In England this relief in damages is given by the Court of Chancery ‘ in addition to or in substitution for’ the specific relief to which the plaintiff may be entitled by virtue of the statute: 21 &amp; 22 Yict. e. 27, commonly called Sir H. Cairns’s Act. The intention of that act £ was to give the court power to grant complete relief whenever it had a well-founded jurisdiction to entertain the case, and not to compel a plaintiff to ask partial relief in one court and then turn him over to another in order to obtain supplemental relief:’ Headley v. Emery, L. R. 1 Eq. 54. I have not the statute at hand to examine, but if it goes no further than is here represented, it seems to me that it does not extend the recognised power of the court: Denton <em>v. </em>Stewart, cited 1 Ves. p. 329; Greenway <em>v. </em>Adams, 12 Ves. 395; Phillips <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/johns-ch/1/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Johns. Ch. 131" data-case-ids="1975581" data-case-paths="/johns-ch/1/0131-01">1 Johns. Ch. 131</a>; Woodcock <em>v. </em>Bennett, 1 Cowen 711. Although these are cases on bills for the specific performance of contracts of sale, I see no reason why the same principle should not apply to other cases, and that whenever a court of equity originally has jurisdiction of the cause of complaint, and for any reason it becomes impracticable to give the relief specifically cited, it may not substitute compensation in damages. I have felt much inclined to refer this case back to the master to ascertain the damages. To decree that the wall should be removed, would be to enable the plaintiff to demand an extortionate sum. The plaintiff’s builder, who, as to this matter, must be regarded as his agent duly authorized, having accepted, paid for, and used the wall, it seems to me he has no equity to ask a decree that it should be pulled <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>down. I have hesitated as to whether after the wall had been finished or nearly so, the case is not one in which the party should be remitted to his legal remedies. A reference would delay the final decision. On the whole, then, I have come to the conclusion to dismiss the bill.”</p>

The defendant erected in 1870 a building, <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>intended for a museum and theatre, covering the whole of his lot, the north wall of which was an eighteen-inch brick party-wall, which by law should be six and a half inches on the plaintiff’s lot. Mr. Shedaker gave to the defendant, or his agent, the true line between the two properties, in his capacity as Surveyor and Regulator of the Third District, and the stone foundation of the party-wall was correctly laid. The brick wall was carried up, beginning at stone foundation, as would appear by Mr. Shedaker’s measurement of the 30th and 31st of August, 1870, three-eighths of an inch over on the plaintiff’s lot beyond the limit allowed by law. In extending the wall back on the stone cellar wall, in different parts it overlapped three-quarters of an inch and seven-eighths of an inch, and in the middle of building the wall overhung the lot No. 110 top of first story 2f- inches, at top of second story 3J inches, and four feet above the floor on the third floor 4J inches.

It was for a certain price; Rush contracting to pay for all party-walls. Defendant’s cellar wall was up before the contract was signed, and the excavation for the building on No. 110 was commenced on the 23d of June 1870. Defendant’s wall was carried up ahead of the plaintiff, and Mr. Rush saw the wall was coming over, and notified Mr. John Bingham, who had charge of the work at the time, that the wall was coming over, and that he had better shore it. He did so, but put the shore in the wrong place. Mr. Rush put in the joists in the party-wall, and paid for the party-wall, according to his contract. The plaintiff having heard of its overhanging, employed Mr. Shedaker to make the measurement already stated, and immediately took measures to have this error corrected, which ended in filing this bill in equity on September 22d 1870. The wall is up and both buildings are under roof. The usual five days’ injunction was issued and dissolved on the 29th of September.
