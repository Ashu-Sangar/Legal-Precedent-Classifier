At maturity this note not being paid was protested for non-payment, of which the endorsers had notice. About seventeen days afterwards said Burkhalter brought to the plaintiffs his promissory note, dated 8th July 1870, payable sixty days after date, for a similar amount, to the order of the defendants, and purporting to be endorsed by them, and which was given to the said plaintiffs as a renewal of the note of 8th April 1870.
