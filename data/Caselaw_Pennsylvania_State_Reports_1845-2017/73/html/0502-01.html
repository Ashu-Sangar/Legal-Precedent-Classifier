On an examination of the. recognisances taken by the prothonotary of the court below, I find that they are not in the precise form prescribed by the Act of Assembly; but as the plaintiffs in error propose to correct the mistake by entering into new recognisances before me in the form prescribed by law, I will allow the same to be done.</p>

The proceedings in the court below were founded on mortgages, and were commenced by writs of scire facias. The proceedings are <em>in rem </em>and not <em>in personam. </em>Moreover, in the mortgages there is an express agreement between the parties that there shall be no personal liability on the part of the' mortgagors, and that “ the lien and collection of the purchase-money shall be ‘limited and restricted to the property covered by and included in the mortgages.” The property therein mentioned must be responsive to the judgments. I am therefore of opinion that the recog<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>nisances need not be in sums double the amount of the money judgments, but only in sums sufficient to pay the costs which may accrue, or be adjudged as accruing in these cases; and for this responsibility I deem the sum of $200 amply sufficient. I have therefore permitted recognisances in the form prescribed by law (sect.'7, Act of June 16th 1836, Pamph. L. 762), to be entered intp, with sureties who have <em>justified </em>before me in each case in the sum above named.</p>
