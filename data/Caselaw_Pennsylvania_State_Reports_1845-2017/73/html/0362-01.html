The members must be regularly admitted, must not be infirm, must be citizens and between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years of age; and no person shall be <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>entitled to any benefits from this society until he shall have been one year a member. Each person, on being admitted a member of their society, shall pay such entrance-money and monthly dues and contributions as the society may by their by-laws from time to time declare. A member is not in full standing if in arrears for fines, contributions or monthly dues; and not entitled to benefits in sickness if in arrears for dues, contributions, or fines, for three .successive stated meetings, and may be expelled for arrears of dues or fines. The amount to be paid in case of death of a member or his wife is fixed. There are other provisions showing that the benevolence is strictly a matter of contract, and may be enforced in a court of justice. The object of this society shall be the relief of its respective members when sick, or disabled by bodily infirmities to pursue their ordinary avocations. Its benevolence begins and ends at home. In Babb <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Rawle%20155" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Rawle 155">5 Rawle 155</a>, it was held that an association for the purposes of mutual benevolence among its members only, is not an association for charitable uses. This was a lodge of Odd Fellows. In Blenon’s Estate, Brightly’s Reports 338, the beneficial societies who were claimants under the will of the testator, as “institutions of charity and benevolence,” were so considered by the auditors, which decision was reversed by the Orphans’ Court, who decreed “that no friendly or beneficial society is entitled to any share in the bequest of the testator,” which decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court. These decisions are the settled law of this court.</p>
