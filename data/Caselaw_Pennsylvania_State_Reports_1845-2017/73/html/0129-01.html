To this decision of the court the plaintiff took no exception at the time; but sued out this writ of error. Afterwards, without the request of either party, the court filed an opinion. Several facts are therein averred that do not otherwise appear.

The report shows that the water was drawn down; the remains of the old dam were examined ; and the iron bolt was driven or adopted by the two arbitrators only. The third arbitrator was not present. He was not consulted in regard to them. He had no knowledge that they were done. The two only consulted together. They alone considered and deliberated. They alone passed upon the question of damages down to the date of the award. They alone decided the case, seven months after they had held any conversation with the other arbitrator. The facts do not present such a joint consideration and deliberation as the law requires. The learned judge erred in entering judgment upon the award.</p>
