Heist (defendant) testified that Hart (plaintiff) told witness that there was a man at plaintiff’s bank who held a note against defendants and wanted it discounted. “ I asked what note. He said a note for this machinery and patent right. I told him I thought it very strange that a man was here with that note, because he (P. Hevner) had promised me not to negotiate that note; he would lock it up in his fire-proof and there it should remain until due. Mr. Hart then said that of course it ought to have been put in the note, that it was not negotiable. I told him of course it would have been better, but Hevner made such fair promises that I thought everything would be right and that he would not negotiate the note. Mr. Hart said he thought he would come up and see about it whether it was all right. He then said the note could be gotten at a good discount. I then told him if it could be got right so as to let me out I would buy it myself, but I did not think I could buy it so as to let me out. He then asked me if he should buy it for me. I asked if he would furnish the money. He said if he Avould' furnish the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>money he would buy it for himself. I told him again I did not think I could buy it so as to let me out, but asked to go and see Tom, my brother, and see what he would have to say in regard to the matter. Hart and I then started towards Tom’s office, and met Tom; told Tom that Hart was here with a note that this man from Philadelphia had come up to have discounted; he told Hart he thought it very strange that that man was here trying to negotiate that note, because he had made such fair promises not to negotiate it, but lock it up in his fire-proof until it was due. Mr. •Hart then said that ‘ not negotiable ’ should have been put in the note. Tom said it would have been better. Then Hart said, ‘ But of course if I buy the note it can be collected.’ I spoke up, ‘But you have notice of it now.’ I think he asked if the machinery did not work; we told him we could not tell much about it yet, but did not think it was all right; knew it was not all right. Ido not recollect all here, but Hart got warmed up a little. Tom and I then stepped back and talked the matter over what we had better do. Tom then walked up to Mr. Hart and said, ‘Mr. Hart, I now give you notice not to buy that note.’ Hart said, ‘If you do not want me to buy the note I won’t buy it;’ before he said that he also said he did not want to buy a lawsuit, and then said, ‘If you do not want me to buy it I won’t buy it,’ then started down the street; think it was in the latter part of December 1870, shortly after the machinery was put up.”</p>

Hevner said when the notes became due he would help defendants to renew them; w’ould give defendants all the time they wanted. Hevner said he would put the notes in the fire-proof and not negotiate them. The machine was worth nothing, but as second-hand machinery ; none of Hevner’s representations were true.

It is not pretended that distinct notice of the fraud was given to him, or even that the Heists gave him notice generally, that they had been defrauded. Unaccompanied with any allegation, that there was a representation or warranty at the time of the contract, that the machine was to produce certain results, the mere statement that it did not work right, was no defence to the note. Nor was the fact that Hevner had agreed not to negotiate the note, and to renew it until it could be paid out of the profits, any more available, even as between the parties. Such a parol agreement, though made at the time, is inadmissible in evidence to vary the effect of the written contract in the case of negotiable paper: Hill <em>v. </em>Gaw, 4 Barr 493 ; Mason <em>v. </em>Graff, 11 Casey 448. Hart understood this, for he told Heist that if such was the agreement, the note should have been made non-negotiable on its face, and Heist assented to it. The information communicated by the Heists to Hart, so far from notifying him of any defence, was calculated to mislead him to believe there really was none. A mere, general notice that there was some defence, and that the note would not be paid, might be enough to put a party on inquiry. Hart may have been bound to ask the maker what was his defence. When he does so, however, and is only told what is clearly no defence, there is nothing which ought to impeach his bona fides. The first assignment of error is not sustained.</p>

Conceding that the production of the assignment of the patent right for Pennsylvania by Harris &amp; Oliver to Hevner, for the consideration of $40,000, and the representation by Hevner, that he had paid that sum, when in fact, the true consideration was only four or five thousand dollars, and that the larger amount had been inserted by Hevner’s request to enable him to impose upon the purchasers of county rights, was a fraud, which, between the parties, <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>avoided the note, and conceding that the proof of this was sufficient to entitle the makers after notice, to require the holder to prove that he had given value, yet the evidence of Hart, which was entirely uncontradicted, was, that he had paid $1800 for it. The charge of the learned judge below, so far as regarded this point, that if the jury believed the evidence, they should find for the * plaintiff, was therefore entirely correct.</p>
