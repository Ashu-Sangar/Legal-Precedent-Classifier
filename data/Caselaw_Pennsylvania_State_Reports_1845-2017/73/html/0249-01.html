Another gentleman brought him a plan of the lot on Christian street, and he was so much pleased with it that he directed me to buy it at once. I did so ;■ and when the contract was signed and a part of the' consideration paid, he expressed great pleasure that it was concluded, as it relieved his mind from all anxiety. Some days after, he recurred again to this subject, as it had probably occurred to him that he had given me an absolute discretion as to the situation of the library by the terms of his will, and that I-might be induced to overrule his decision after he was gone. He called me to his bedside and asked me to give him a promise that I would <em>build the library on that lot, and nowhere else. </em>I gave him this promise as fully and solemnly as language could express it, and he then thanked me and said he could now die in peace. Now, do you think it would be at all consistent with truth and honesty for me voluntarily to violate a pledge given under circumstances which render it as sacred as an oath, and made to a dying man who had confided to me the management of his whole estate ?

He asked me to ascertain to a certainty their feelings on'this subject, but not being willing that his testamentary intentions should be generally known, he only authorized me to communicate them to two of the managers, viz., Mr. Henry Wharton and Colonel Alexander Biddle, whose opinions I was requested to ask. I desired Colonel Biddle to accompany me to Mr. Wharton’s office, and then stated to them that Dr. Rush had given almost his whole fortune, amounting to a •million of dollars, to build a library at Broad and Christian streets, and asked them if they thought the Library Company would object to that location.

      <em>“ </em>The docter died within five or six days thereafter. This promise, then, was demanded and given a very few days prior to his death. It was two years after the last codicil to his will had been executed. It was demanded of a brother-in-law to whom he was about to intrust more than a million of dollars — I say about to intrust, for there was yet time for him to revoke the will and all of its trusts. He was unwilling to pass all his vast estate into the hands of the defendant upon the implied assurance that the library building would be located upon the lot which he had purchased for its site. Hence he made the specific demand. What his action would have been, had the defendant’s answer not been in accord •with his judgment, is left to conjecture. He suffered his will to remain unchanged. He passed from this earth, there is every reason to believe, in an abiding faith that he had restrained the free <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>choice of the defendant, and that he had secured the erection of the library building upon the lot designated by himself.</p>

He knew that he had been named in the testator’s will as his trustee and executor. Sitting by the bedside of his dying friend and brother — recognising the doctor’s right to control his own property — wishing to relieve his mind from all doubt upon the subject that troubled him, the defendant then and there promised, as fully and as solemnly as language could express it, to put the building on that lot and nowhere else. Ho not all the attendant and surrounding circumstances impress the mind of every conscientious and reflecting person with the very strong moral obligation thereby imposed upon the defendant ? I can scarcely conceive one stronger. The greater the integrity, the higher the moral sense, the stronger would be' the obligation upon the conscience. That the defendant possesses both in a high degree is manifest in his letter of the 30th of December before referred to. When asked, in behalf of the claimants, to reconsider his intention of building on said lot, and locate the building elsewhere, his answer was such as did credit alike to his conscience and to his heart. After repeating the promise which he had made, and the circumstances under which it was made, he says: — ‘ Now, do you think it would be at all consistent with truth and honesty for me voluntarily to violate a pledge given under circumstances which render it as sacred as an oath, and made to a dying man who had confided to me the whole of his estate ? Would you, with your well-known delicacy and sensibility to all honorable engagements, feel yourself justified in doing so were the case your own, and should I not lose your respect and regard (which I value very highly) were I to hesitate for a moment as to what was my duty ? ’</p>

Conscience, resting under an obligation strong as an oath, bound him to the observance of his promise. With that deep recognition of moral obligation resting upon his conscience, he assumed the duties of the trust. He thinks he executed the power and discharged the trust under the written will alone, wholly uninfluenced by his promise.</p>

If, however, he be correct, there must have been a time when his conscience was absolved from this deep moral obligation — a time when he threw it off, and when the lawful one took exclusive possession of his judgment. I understand the answer to be that it was at the time he was obligated to take the usual oath in order to assume the duties of executor. This was on the 31st of May 1869. This latter oath, he says, created a legal as well as a moral obligation. Did it, however, wholly eradicate the moral obligation, <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>‘sacrecl as an oath,’ under which he had rested up to that time?

If the donor induced the donee to accept the trust under a pledge that he would execute it otherwise than was provided in the instrument, he committed, in equity, a fraud upon the power. If the donee accepted it under such pledge and so executed it, he committed a fraud upon the power. It is not necessarily a moral fraud.

He pondered the subject and then made his will. At first he restricted the site of the building to certain central limits ; but the rapid progress of the city during the eventful period of 1860 to 1867, altered his views of location. Fearful, if his charity were placed near the centre of the city, where property was rising rapidly, that the building might be swept away by the tide of speculation, he made a codicil, revoked the restriction, and enabled his executor to go beyond the limits stated in <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>his will. Still reflecting upon his scheme for about two years more, and anxious to locate his charity to suit his own thoughts, he had careful examinations made by his friend and executor, and finding no other site suitable, either in price or size, he finally chose a spacious square on the great central avenue of the city, a few squares south of the original limit, and bought it at a cost of $130,000, or about one-eighth of his entire estate. Upon this ground he directed his executor to build, and, to. secure his cooperation, obtained his promise to do so. This promise was given, the executor swears most positively, not only out of regard to the testator’s wishes, but because the lot and site were approved by his own judgment, founded on a previous examination of all the known eligible sites. Within a month after the death of Dr. Rush, Henry J. Williams, the executor, consulted eminent counsel as to the obligation of the contract of purchase upon the estate and upon his own duties in making the selection, and was advised by Judge Strong that the purchase was binding, that his power of selection was absolute, and was to be exercised upon his own judgment.</p>

Mr. Williams made the selection under the will, and communicated it to the Library Company on the 29th of June 1869, having previously stated it to individual members. Mr. Williams, the executor, a member himself of the Library Company, having no selfish or hostile interest, an old and skilful lawyer, well informed of his duties, a gentleman of intelligence and refinement, one whose integrity and purity of character are conceded by the plaintiffs to the fullest extent, is admitted to have acted in perfect good faith, and he, on his oath, attests that he acted upon his own judgment. It is alleged that the selection of the site at Broad and Christian streets, chosen and purchased by the testator, and adopted by the executor, must be set aside, not because of any intent to disappoint the trust, or of the slightest <em>mala fides, </em>but because the mind of the trustee was, by reason of a promise to the testator, under a constraint, of which he was unconscious when he made the selection, which made him incapable of exercising his judgment, notwithstanding he swears that he did act upon his own judgment, and because it accorded with his promise. The proposition, instead of being so plain and clearly established that a court of equity can act upon it to set aside the testator’s choice and oust his trustee, is simply incredible, and is destructive of the right of pi’ivate property. It denies the power of self-knowledge and the capability of self-examination, upon which the doctrine of accountability for the thoughts and purposes of the heart rests. It asserts a want of power to introspect our consciousness and motives of action under the responsibility of an oath, and our ability to distinguish between the obligation of a promise and the determination of the judgment in doing an act of importance pondered for weeks. The case is <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>brought directly to this point, for the positive, distinct and reiterated assertions of Mr. Williams, in his answer and his testimony, that he did act upon his own judgment, compel us to decide either that he does not know the operations of his own mind, or that he is forsworn. The latter alternative is conceded on all hands to be untrue. Can it be possible that a court, in such a case and on such ground, will depose the executor, cast the property purchased by the testator back upon the estate, wrest the power from his hands, and place it in the hands of others ? There is no such case to be found in the books here or elsewhere; and if any can be found abroad, it cannot be imported into this free state.

Williams’s assertion that he acted on his own judgment, for they are processes of thought, or steps which lead to his conclusion. Now, let us see what he says on oath as to the exercise of.his own judgment; and first in his answer in direct response to the bill: “ I selected the Droad and Christian street lot when I had assumed the executorship, after calm, careful and deliberate consideration, having thought of it in every shape, favorable and unfavorable, in which it had been presented, because it was in my judgment, the best I could obtain for the object and purposes of Dr. Rush’s will, and because it combined adequate dimensions with cheapness and position.” In regard to his promise to Dr. Rush — the alleged ground of disqualification — after stating his efforts to find a suitable lot, he says: <em>“ </em>It was after this that the promise stated in my letter of the 30th December 1870, was made to him. This was given with a knowledge of almost every circumstance which led subsequently to my decision, when, as his executor, it became my duty to determine the site of the library.” Again: “ I aver that at the time I made said promise I thought it the best lot for the purpose which could be obtained, and I aver that after careful reflection and subsequent examination I still entertain this opinion.” There is much more in the answer to the same effect.</p>

      <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>His testimony is as strong as his answer. When asked whether his judgment was not influenced by his promise, he replied : “ Not that I am conscious of at all. I believe if I had made no promise, and had not known the wishes of Dr. Rush, my judgment would have been the same.” Again he said: “ If my promise to Dr. Rush, and my oath as executor had been at all in conflict, I would have resigned my executorship at once, and left some other person to put up the building.”</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[247,733,1173,1465]]]'>Much more he said to the point, but this will suffice to show the strong and positive convictions of his mind. In these assertions he is also strongly corroborated by the testimony of many witnesses as to what took place just before Dr. Rush’s death, and the communication of the selection of the lot to Mr. Wharton, Mr. Riddle and others. He consulted counsel, as proved by Judge Strong’s letter of the 15th of June 1869, before the meeting of the Library Company, on the 29th of June, when his selection was formally made known. A committee of conference was appointed at this meeting. To Mr. Fraley, one of the committee, who suggested other lots, he replied that they had all been examined, and that the prices were so high they did not suit Dr. Rush, and that the lot at Broad and Christian streets had been selected because, in the judgment of both Dr. Rush and himself., it combined all the advantages which he wished to secure. He again consulted Judge Strong, who replied July 19th 1869, saying : “ As executor, you are guided by the written will. In the exercise of the discretion reposed in you by that instrument, you may regard Dr. Rush’s views and wishes orally expressed; but after all <em>your </em>judgment, however it may be made up, must be your guide in matters left to your discretion.” Again urged by Mr. Fraley to change the selection on the 6th of August 1869, he replied: “ <em>I deem </em>that situation (the Broad and Christian lot) most expedient under all the circumstances of the case, for I <em>consider </em>its distance from the centre of the city as far outweighed by its other advantages, and I have the consolation of knowing that this decision is in entire accordance with the wishes of the testator, who selected and purchased this lot for this very purpose in his lifetime.” The Library Company themselves knew he had exercised his own judgment in the matter. A meeting was called for the 19th of October 1869, to vote on the acceptance or rejection of the provisions of Dr. Rush’s will. 'Committees were raised <em>pro </em>and <em>con </em>to influence the opinions of the members when the meeting should take place, and circulars were issued.</p>

    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[139,684,1167,1551]]]'>It was after all these things had occurred, and nineteen months after the death of Dr. Rush, the letter of December 30th 1870, was written, the stronghold and fortress of the plaintiffs’ bill. The object and purpose of this letter are made obvious by the circumstances which have evoked it. Controversy had arisen, and the Library Company had made several efforts to induce Mr. Williams to revoke his selection, and finally, at a meeting of the company, on the 10th of December 1870, resolutions were passed, one of which expressed the “ earnest hope and <em>request </em>that Mr. Williams would <em>reconsider </em>his intention to build on the site chosen.” Dr. Willing, Judge Hare and Mr. Lea were appointed a committee to confer with Mr. Williams, and a correspondence ensued, in which Mr. Williams adhered to his selection. The letter of December 30th 1870 was then written, at the invitation of Dr. Willing, as a <em>formal </em>expression of Mr. Williams’s intentions. He restates his convictions, and expresses his surprise that ho should be again asked to change his intentions, and proceeds to defend himself against censure for refusing to change his mind. Then he pleads the sacred character of his promise. He cannot yield his judgment, but pressed hard to do so, he appeals to the well known sensibility of the gentlemen composing the committee, to all honorable engagements, if the case were their own. He repeats, also, what he has always said, that to change would be in opposition to <em>his own deliberate judgment; </em>and “ <em>I mean this </em>(he adds) <em>in its fullest sense.” </em>This letter, written at the close of the year 1870, long after the controversy had existed, in defence of his motives and his reputation, evoked by the direct action of the Library Company, instead of proving that Mr. Williams acted without judgment, and from unconscious restraint, proves the convictions of a mind thoroughly convinced, and a heart that was fixed upon a just purpose. Admit that he was also influenced by his promise to his friend. So he ought to be, wdien, as he swears, it was an approving judgment. This is a proper influence, and does not show a man void of discretion, and so bound by conscience that his judgment is lost in the obligation of a foolish pledge.</p>

    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[250,464,1170,1162]]]'>But that a court of equity can pronounce the verbal direction, and, still stronger, the <em>act </em>of this testator, in the very line of his own power, and a promise to conform to it, <em>ipso facto, </em>a fraud on the power, is contrary to reason and the plainest principles of equity. The reverse is true, for it is the province of equity to follow the mind of the testator. So clear is this principle, that a court of equity will sometimes convert the devisee, even of an absolute estate, into a trustee, in order to compel him to perform a solemn promise given to his testator to dispose of the property according to his verbal direction. In doing this the written will is struck down to reach the equity that lies in the verbal direction. Such was the case of Hoge <em>v. </em>Hoge, <a href="/watts/1/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts 163" data-case-ids="1838024" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0163-01">1 Watts 163</a>, where the testator devised an estate to his brother absolutely, under a verbal direction that it should be for the benefit of his illegitimate son. Chief Justice Gibson cites in his opinion a number of cases where the verbal direction was sustained against the text of the will— one, for instance, where a testator having devised his lands to a nephew, desired his heir-at-law not to disturb the nephew in possession of certain lands acquired after the execution of the will, and it was so decreed. Now if a court of equity, to prevent a fraud upon the testator’s actual intention, will disregard the written text, how much more consonant to equity is it to regard the solemn act of a testator who has involved his estate in the obligation of a contract in the line of a will, and to carry out its very intent; and how can it regard the promise of the executor to follow the wishes of the testator in this respect, as <em>ipso facto, </em>a fraud upon the testator’s power.</p>

How has the promise to the testator vitiated the selection ? What provision of the will does it offend ? How can we say the selection is not made with a broad and thoughtful foresight ? On the contrary, it conforms both to the will and the purpose of the testator. In following the testator’s own act of purchase, nothing but the clearest evidence of incapacity in the testator , to select, or of folly in the selection, and of blind and unreasoning obedience in the executor, can set it aside. I am willing to concede the authority of all the cases cited for the plaintiff, including the Duke of Portland’s case. They may be summed up in a single view — that a chancellor will so control a trustee that he shall not disappoint the true intent and purpose of the donor, as gathered from the instrument containing'the power. To execute it otherwise is a fraud on the power. Hence, it is said, <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>“ lie must execute it <em>bond fide for the-end </em>designed.” It may be a corollary, also, that an innocent motive will not save the exercise of the power, if it violate the true purpose of the trust. Broader than this there can be no conception of chancery, power in Pennsylvania, where the citizen is secured by the constitution in his rights of property. When a testator, to fulfil his own purpose, confers an absolute discretion as to his property, it is <em>his </em>right to have the boon executed by his own trustees; and no court can, without clear and adequate cause, displace the trustee without violating the right of property.</p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[151,827,1168,1208]]]'>This is well expressed in the letter of advice of 15th June 1869, from Judge Strong, under which Mr. Williams acted. “ A court of equity does not interfere with a discretion reposed, except in cases of <em>’clear </em>abuse, when the court <em>can </em>conclude that the donee of a power is <em>acting in fraud of it. </em>But when, as in your case, the trustee acts in accordance with his own best judgment, and in so doing, follows the positive directions of his testator, it would be altogether <em>unprecedented for a court to interfere and substitute </em>its discretion for that invoked by the will.” In this statement he is most distinctly supported by two recent cases decided by this court: Pulpress <em>v. </em>African Church, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20204" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="12 Wright 204">12 Wright 204</a>, and Naglee’s Estate, 2 P. F. Smith 154. To these may be added a few citations from elementary writers. In the recent work of Mr. Perry on Trusts, the modern decisions are brought up. On page 455, section 508, he says, when the discretion to be exercised is a matter of personal judgment, “the trustees alone can exercise these powers, and courts cannot generally interfere to control mere personal judgments in personal matters.” For this, numerous cases are cited. Again on page 457, section 511, “If the trustees exercise their discretionary power in <em>good faith, </em>and without fraud or collusion, the court cannot review or control their discretion.” For this, twenty-four cases are cited. “ Nor will a bill be entertained to compel the execution of a mere discretionary power.” <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20204" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="12 Wright 204">Id.</a> Mr. Hill, in his work on Trustees, ed. 1846, p. 482, says, “ as a court of equity will not, in general, assume the exercise of a discretionary power vested in trustees, so it will not interfere to control the trustees acting bond fide in the exercise of their discretion.” He cites many cases for this statement.</p>
