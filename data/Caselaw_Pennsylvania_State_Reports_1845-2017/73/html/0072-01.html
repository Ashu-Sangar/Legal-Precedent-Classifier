Mr. Emmet first called between the 27th of December 1869, and first week in January 1870, to see me. He made inquiry concerning these six packages. I informed him they had been delivered to consignees, J. Furniss &amp; Co. He said, had you no word from Philadelphia to hold goods ? I said I had not.” * * *</p>

These goods were received by our firm, and delivered from line by our draymen. We received bills from this firm by due course of mail. There were conditions at same time as bills were received. We received notice from Riegel &amp; Co. There were no directions not to receive the goods; but after they were received, certain conditions were to be complied with. Goods were received about middle of December. Emmet’s first visit was after the holidays, and about the 1st of January I saw him ; visited store several times; came in in a friendly way. He did not tell us we ought not to have received goods, and found no fault with us for receiving them. We closed our house on the 26th of January, the day our failure took place.

[The contract depends entirely upon a verbal arrangement, of which you are the judges. The goods were not sent according to the usual and ordinary terms by which this company sends goods, but they were sent under a special contract.] The first question is, what the contract is ? The second, whether the plaintiff has complied with the terms of the contract. If the plaintiff complied, and the defendants did not, then the defendants are answerable. One of the parties to the arrangement was a member of the firm of Riegel &amp; Co., and I will read portions of his testimony. Then I will read a portion of the testimony of Mr. Welsh.” (Judge Readhere read Scott’s testimony), £££Isent for Mr. Welsh on 10th of December 1869.- I told him I had six packages to send — that they were not to be delivered until we instructed the Union Transportation Company to deliver them. Mr. Welsh told me not to put the name of the firm on the packages; he told me to mark F, care of S. E. Gray, agent, Indianapolis, Indiana. He said he would write to <em>‘ </em>the agent there.

He said he had goods to send to Indianapolis, to Eurniss <em>&amp; </em>Co., <em>who were not so good. </em>I told him he had <em>better </em>mark the goods F, and give no other consignee, and then the agent would not know to whom the goods were to be delivered.

It is returned to the shipper, and does not go on with the goods. Where there is a special contract, such as this was, it is a question whether that receipt formed any part of the contract at all. The evidence is that Mr. Scott subsequently asked Mr. Welsh whether any instructions were given in regard to the shipping receipt, so that what was done with the shipping receipt does not make any difference in regard to the contract that was made.] Then this item of direction is on the back of the receipt.

[If it was not put into the post-office, it was the negligence of the parties; and perhaps there should have been some testimony to show that that letter went into the post-office; because, when a party writes a letter and intended to send it, and it never arrives, it is proper to trace the letter into the post-office, if anyone knows anything about it.] We can only assume that the letter was written, and that it did not arrive.

The plaintiffs claimed this to be the contract under which they delivered, and the defendants received, the goods.</p>
