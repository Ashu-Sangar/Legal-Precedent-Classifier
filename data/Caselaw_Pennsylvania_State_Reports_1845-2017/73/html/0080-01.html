The defendant owned a lot fronting on the Bustleton and Somerton turnpike road; the plaintiff owned a lot directly back of it and adjoining it. Both lots had belonged to John Hatcher in <em>1856, </em>and were separated <em>from bis neighbor, </em>Wendle, by a fence, along which was a lane from the lot now the plaintiff’s to the turnpike; there was no fence on the side of the lane next Hatcher’s own land. Whilst Hatcher owned both lots he put a gate at the end of the lane on the turnpike. On the 26th of February 1858, the gate still being at the end of the lane, Hatcher conveyed the rear lot (plaintiff’s) to 0. C.

Yandegrift and Hatcher and the plaintiff and Hatcher had used the gate in common. About March 1870, plaintiff took the gate down and it so continued about ten months; the defendant then put it up. He also brought suit on the 2d of April 1869, before an alderman against the plaintiff here, “ in a plea of trespass in damage to real estate on the 8th of April, the return-day, Connery appeared before the alderman, Brooks not appearing, and claimed “ five dollars and twenty-five cents in trespass for damages done by defendant to plaintiff’s real estate in tearing down and breaking plaintiff’s gate;” judgment was rendered for Connery on the same day for $5.25: after the issuing of an execution, the amount of the judgment was paid by Brooks and received by Connery.</p>

It stands back from the road, and the only access to it is through the defendant’s land. Both parties claim under John Hatcher, who was the owner of a tract of land' near the Second Street turnpike. In the year 1858, J. Hatcher sold and conveyed the premises to Yandegrift, with the free use, right and privilege of a passage-way ten feet in width, through the land of the grantor, extending from the house to the turnpike. An execution was subsequently issued against Yandegrift, and his title came through divers mesne conveyances to the plaintiff. It appeared from the evidence given at the trial, that the way which had been laid out when Vandegrift went into possession in accordance with the provisions of the deed, was closed by. a gate at the point where it led into the turnpike. This was presumably done with his consent, and remained without objection until the title vested <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>in the plaintiff. The gate was then taken down by him and put up again by the defendant. The plaintiff then brought suit to recover for the alleged obstruction of the right of way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[277,533,1184,689]]]'>“ The question may be considered as arising solely on the deed, or on the deed in connection with the parol evidence. The words of a grant are to be taken as strongly against the grantor as their «natural import warrants. By the ‘free use, right and privilege of a passage-way,’ we can only understand a way unimpeded by any means whatever. If the plaintiff can erect one gate he may put up another, or close the access to the road by movable bars. It has been said that some precaution of the kind was requisite to prevent cattle from trespassing on the lot through which the way passed. If the gate was the only means of effecting this object it does not follow that it could be used. But <em>there </em>are <em>other </em>methods which might have been resorted to, as for instance, a fence separating the lane from the field. That this would be more expensive and less convenient than a gate, is no reason for detracting from the words of the grant. The question is not one of good neighborhood, but of legal right.</p>

When the ambiguity is latent, and results from the application of the instrument to the matter in hand, the contemporaneous acts and declarations of the parties may sometimes be taken into view in arriving at a conclusion. Such evidence, however, has never been thought admissible when the question is what was intended, and not to what the intention applies. This is peculiarly true when the words are clear, and admit grammatically of but one construction. That Yandegrift suffered the gate to be erected and allowed it to remain without objection would not have precluded him from requiring it to be taken down unless the adverse use had continued for twenty-one years, and the plaintiff cannot be in a worse position than the persons under whom he claims. It was at the most an admission, which, if made in terms, would not have controlled the construction of the deed: Hamilton <em>v. </em>Neel, <a href="/watts/7/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 517" data-case-ids="1846850" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0517-01">7 Watts 517</a>, 520; The Boston Hat Co. <em>v. </em>Messinger, <a href="/mass/19/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Pick. 223" data-case-ids="2049700" data-case-paths="/mass/19/0239-01">2 Pick. 223</a>; The Bank <em>v. </em>McFarland, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Hill%20432" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Hill 432">5 Hill 432</a>, 436.</p>

Undoubtedly, as a general rule, the words of a grant are to be understood in their ordinary and natural sense, and if there is any doubt as to their meaning, they are to be taken most strongly against the grantor. But they are to receive a reasonable construction, and one that will accord with the intention of the parties; and, in order to ascertain their intention, the court must look at the circumstances under which the grant was <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>made: Cox <em>v. </em>Freedley, 9 Casey 124. At the time of the grant in this case, February 26th 1858, there was a gate across the passageway at its intersection with the turnpike, and it continued there, with the exception of the short interval it was out of repair, until the institution of this action in September 1869. What then was the intention of the parties, and what did they mean by “ the free use, right and privileges of a passageway ten feet in width?” Did they mean that it should be an open passageway into the turnpike without any gate at its intersection? If so, why was not the gate removed as soon as the grant was made ? Why was it allowed to remain ? The fact that the gate was there at the date of the grant, and that it was allowed to remain, cannot change the plain meaning of the words of the grant, but it may help us to ascertain the intention of the parties, if there be any doubt as to their meaning. <em>Contemporánea expositio est optima et fortissima in lege. </em>Undoubtedly, the plaintiff was entitled to the free use, right and privilege of passageway ten feet in width, with free ingress and egress at all times, for this is the language of the grant. But what is meant by the free use of a passageway ? Does it necessarily mean that there shall be no gate or door hung across it, or if there is, that it shall always be kept open ? Has not the owner of a passageway its free use if he hangs a gate across it at its intersection with the street? If I grant the free use, right and privilege of the hall of my house, with free ingress and egress at all times, must I take off the door leading into it, or keep it wide open in order that the grantee may have the free use of it ? Or can he not have its free use if he can enter it by opening the door whenever he chooses ? Without doubt I cannot unreasonably obstruct his use of it, but if the door amounts practically to little or no inconvenience, it seems to me that it is not necessarily a wrongful obstruction. Free is a relative term when applied to the use of a thing. It does not follow that I have not the free use of a room because I have to open a door in order to get into it; nor does it follow that I have not the free use of an alley because I have to open a gate to go in and out of it. A gate may be so placed as to be a practical and unreasonable obstruction to the free use of a passageway; and it may be so constructed and placed as not to amount to any practical obstruction to its use. Whether the gate in this case amounted to a wrongful obstructipn was, therefore, a question of fact for the jury. If it was not a practical hindrance, and, under the circumstances, an unreasonable obstruction to the plaintiff’s use of the passageway, then it was not a wrongful or illegal obstruction for which an action will lie.</p>
