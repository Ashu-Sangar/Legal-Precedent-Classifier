It is objected on the part of the defendant that •the amount cannot be ascertained from the paper itself, and therefore no judgment can be entered upon it. But the writing provides the mode of ascertaining the amount of purchase-money; and that is by a survey of the number of acres, the price per acre being fixed in the contract. The defendant does not allege that the quantity has not been determined by a survey, nor does he allege that the judgment has been entered for too large a sum. The writing authorizes a judgment to be entered for the amount of the purchase-money, and points out the manner of ascertaining the amount due. If the amount due has been ascertained by a correct survey and judgment has been entered for no more than is due, we think the judgment is regular and fully authorized by the writing of the parties.</p>

This act does not confer upon the prothonotary all the power of an attorney at law to confess a judgment, but only authorizes him without the agency of an attorney to enter a judgment in the way specified in the act, to wit, for the <em>amount </em>which from the <em>face </em>of the instrument may appear to be due. This would probably embrace a case where the sum due can be ascertained by calculation from the face of the writing, upon the maxim, <em>id cerium est quod cerium reddi potest. </em>But in this case the sum or amount due, could by no possible calculation be made to appear from the face of the instrument. It was an agreement for the sale of a tract of land by loosely-stated boundaries and no quantity stated. The price was to be at the rate of ten dollars an acre, and the number of acres was to be ascertained by a survey. Until the number should be thus determined, a matter wholly outside of the face of the paper, the amount of the purchase-money could not be known. The prothonotary had no guide, therefore, in entering the judgment. In fixing the sum he must rely upon evidence outside of the writing, and this would not be according to the letter or spirit of the act, which intended that a judgment should he entered only on the acknowledgment of the party himself contained in the writing. It is evident the law did not intend to make the prothonotary an arbitrator or umpire to determine uncertain things, and to conclude the party by his act; for by entering the judgment the party is brought into court and the judgment is final and Concludes him, unless set aside or reversed. The filing of a survey and the affidavit of the plaintiff, as permitted by the court on hearing the rule to set the judgment aside, did not mend the matter; for at the bottom lay the want of authority in the prothonotary to bring the defendant into court on this writing. His act must be strictly according to the law, and is not like the general authority of an attorney at law, who may appear and confess judgment and arrange the details of the judgment.</p>
