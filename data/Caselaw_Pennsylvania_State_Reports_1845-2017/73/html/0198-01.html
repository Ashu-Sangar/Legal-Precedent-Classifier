The moment he opened his case, he showed that he was engaged in a business directly contrary to a clear and express Act of Congress. That for so doing, he was liable to a fine and imprisonment. The intent with which he did it, cannot be inquired into in this action. His right to commissions as shown rested upon his illegal acts. His right to recover in law, must depend upon his legal right to perform the services. The facts to which he testified, showed he had no such right.</p>

The case of Maybin <em>v. </em>Coulon, supra, was based upon a violation of the revenue laws of the United States, and the unbroken current of authorities in this state, is to hold a contract void which is grounded upon a clear violation of a statute, although it may not be expressly so declared by its terms.</p>
