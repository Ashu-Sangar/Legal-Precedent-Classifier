The counsel for the plaintiff, in their argument to the court, request us to charge you that there is no evidence in the case showing that Thomas Whitmore, the vendor of the plaintiff, had any knowledge at the time of his purchase from Timmons of the contract of the latter for the sale of the land to Burns, and of the transfer of that contract to, and consequent claim by, the defendant here, to the land, and that, therefore, Whitmore is to be regarded in law as an innocent purchaser without notice; and further, that having thus acquired a good title to the land in question, which he subsequently conveyed to the plaintiff, the latter is entitled to recover.</p>

Moreover, the verdict and judgment therein being a verdict and judgment in ejectment upon an equitable title, was conclusive between the parties, and a bar to any subsequent ejectment, so far as they were concerned, for the same land. And the fact that there is no evidence in the present case, that Thomas Whitmore' was originally a purchaser with notice, is not at all material now.</p>

If, therefore, it has been clearly and satisfactorily shown that the equitable title was then directly in issue and decided upon, we repeat, it was conclusive between the parties. The plaintiff here, a subsequent vendee of Whitmore, cannot now try over again the very equity involved in, and settled by that case.] * *</p>

The difficulty he encountered in this action was the fact that Connelly, the plaintiff in that action, and as assignee of Barnard Burns, the vendee of Terrence Timmons, held an equitable title only, upon which he recovered, the parol evidence showing that it was the only title he set up. No evidence was given to show that Whitmore, the defendant in that action, and grantor of Bolin, the plaintiff in this, set up any defence, other than non-payment of the purchase-money. In this state of the case the recovery of Connelly in the ejectment <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>of I860 was final, according to the doctrine of Seitzinger <em>v. </em>Ridgway, <a href="/watts/9/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Watts 496" data-case-ids="1850034" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0496-01">9 Watts 496</a> and Peterman <em>v. </em>Hulings, 7 Casey 432. Had Whitmore in that trial set up the deed from Terrence Timmons to himself as a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and without notice of the sale of Timmons to Barnard Burns, and that he had duly recorded his deed, a different question might have arisen in the trial of this case. But as no such issue was presented and tried in the former ejectment, we must presume now, that Whit-more failed to set up the defence because he knew then it would not avail him, and therefore defended against the plaintiff’s equity alone. Bolin, the present plaintiff, standing in privity with Whit-more, and having notice of the pendency of the former ejectment when he bought, stands now in no better situation than Whitmore. The verdict and judgment in the former ejectment were therefore final, and now estop the plaintiff from a new trial.</p>
