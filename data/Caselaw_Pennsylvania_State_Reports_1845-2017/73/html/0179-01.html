F. Smith 110, and cases there cited. The sheriff sold and conveyed the lots to the parties in this case without reference to the existence of the alley on the lot purchased by the defendant; but the evidence shows that the alley was open and apparent at the time of the sale, and that there was a gate leading into it from the lot purchased by the plaintiff, clearly indicating that it was used in common by the tenants of both lots. It also appears from the evidence that the alley was laid out and opened by McCabe, the former owner of the lots, and that it was used in common by the occupants thereof for a period of more than ten years prior to the sheriff’s sale¡ The court below was, therefore, clearly right in declining to charge that the sheriffs <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>sale and deed vested the soil of the alleged alley in the defendant, clear of the easement claimed by the plaintiff; and in charging that the only question in the case is, What was the condition of these two properties at the time of the sheriff’s sale ?
