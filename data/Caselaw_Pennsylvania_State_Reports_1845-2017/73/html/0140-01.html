It has been proved by the defendant himself, that he never was married to the plaintiff’s testatrix, but that they lived and cohabited for many years as man and wife. While this constituted a marriage as to all the world in matters pertaining to business transactions, yet it has not that effect as between themselves. To the public, so living and cohabiting raises a conclusive presumption of marriage, for it may know nothing to the contrary, but a party to the presumptive marriage who fully knows that no marriage exists and who has lived in violation of law in this respect, does not stand on that footing, and he cannot claim the incidents of marriage when no marriage existed. To allow this, would be to permit him to take advantage <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>of his own wrong, a thing the law always refuses to do. The defendant made no mistake when he testified that he and the testatrix were never married. Cohabitation did not as to either, amount to lawful marriage. They mutually agreed to live together, he said, and agreed to keep it a secret that they were not married. This was not a marriage as to them. If they had gone through a marriage ceremony in the presence of competent witnesses, I believe it would have been sufficient in law for all the purposes of a legal marriage and sufficient to have entitled the defendant to the possession of the property in question, as tenant by the curtesy, but they did not do this. The defendant ought not to expect immunity from the responsibilities of married life and possess its benefits also. For instance, under the facts disclosed he could not have been made to suffer the penalties of bigamy if he had married another woman during his supposed wife’s life, nor be punished for adultery if he had committed that crime, for in these cases actual, not presumptive marriage must be proved. To this extent, we would loosen some of the most important bonds of matrimony, if we were to hold the defendant entitled to the incidents of actual marriage, although there was none without its responsibilities. The jury can have no difficulty in finding from the testimony the state of facts here referred to. We hear them from the defendant on the stand, and from the testimony of the sisters of the testatrix. Both concur that they were never married and were to keep the fact secret. If this be so the defendant cannot hold the property in question as tenant by the curtesy. About this we see no ground to doubt. We have legislation very particularly regulating marriage in this state, and people complying with it will be in no danger of difficulties like the present; if they do not, they must abide the consequences. * * *</p>

      <em>“ </em>To defendant’s first point I cannot assent. It is true as a general rule. But if there was no actual marriage between defendant and the testatrix, no such relation as husband and wife existed as to them, and defendant would not be entitled to hold the property in question as tenant by the curtesy. This is more fully explained in answer to plaintiff’s point, which is adopted as a further answer to this point.” * * *</p>

They recognised and addressed each other as husband and as wife. She called him her hus<a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>band, he called her his wife. During all that time she bore his name. The three several deeds given in evidence by the plaintiff below, bearing date in 1856 and 1857, show' that the land was conveyed to her as the wife of John H. Diehard. Upon the 27th of March 1858, she duly executed, in the presence of three witnesses, a last will and testament, in which she describes herself as “wife of John H. Diehard.” She therein gives all the residue and remainder of her estate “ unto my said husband, John H. Diehard, his heirs,” &amp;c.</p>

Thus, for nearly forty years, all those evidences of reputation, declarations, and conduct, which usually accompany the marriage relation, are clearly shown to have existed. The evidence which the learned judge held sufficient to overcome this long-continued and consistent life of the parties, was their separate declarations upon one occasion not long prior to her death, and his testimony upon the trial, that they had never been married. The declarations are proven by a sister of Mrs. Diehard, w’ho testifies that was the first knowledge she had of it; and he testifies that the marriage ceremony was never performed. He swears, however, “ by mutual consent we lived as man and wife;” and again, “ I am no relation to her, only she was my wife.” Again he said, “I promised to marry her. Nobody knows that we were not married.” It seems to us that the whole testimony is reconcilable, by assuming him to mean that no formal marriage ceremony had been performed by any third person uniting them in marriage; but that they had agreed to a marriage. That they recognised it as a marriage contract, and had always recognised and fulfilled it as such. His declaration made upon one occasion, when angry at his wife, to her sister, that they were not married, after more than thirty-five years of apparent wedded life, was certainly very weak evidence to rebut the presumption of marriage. Nor did his testimony upon the trial, necessarily go any further than to negative the one form of entering into a marriage contract. It did not prechide the jury from finding that a valid marriage contract had otherwise been entered into between the parties. The evidence was amply sufficient to have submitted this as a question of fact to the jury. Whether the agreement of marriage preceded or followed the first sexual intercourse, whether it was five or ten y'ears thereafter, if clearly made and proved, it established a valid marriage. The learned judge therefore erred in virtually taking the case from <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>the jury, and in saying this was not a marriage a.s to them. lie should have affirmed the first point submitted by the defendant below, and to the extent we have indicated qualified the first point submitted by the plaintiff.</p>
