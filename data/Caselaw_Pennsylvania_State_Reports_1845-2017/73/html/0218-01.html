He averred that the decision of the court was so emphatic that the plaintiff and himself abandoned all claim to the lands and the prosecution of the suit; that after nearly two years, of his own motion, he proposed to the plaintiff in that suit, that with his permission he (Dickey) would take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, but there was no such agreement as to the terms upon which bail was to be entered and expenses paid, as mentioned in this bill; that after the appeal he made efforts to compromise with the trustees; they declined to compromise, and no compro<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>mise was ever made; after consultation with his counsel he came to the conclusion that success in the appeal was hopeless, and as he had, of his own motion, suggested the appeal, he in like manner abandoned it; that several months afterwards he proposed to the trustees to buy the lands; they had failed to sell the lands; had incurred a large debt to save them from sale for taxes, and in j defending the suit; Dickey thought by individual attention and developing the lands he might make a good speculation, and therefore approached the trustees as an independent purchaser; he never proposed to compromise the suit; neither the suit, nor the claim of his wife or of the plaintiffs was an element in the purchase ; he denied that the compromise and purchase were mainly on account of Warder’s children, or that they were to derive the benefit and profits from the lands when they should be sold. He and the trustees had selected two competent persons to examine the lands and fix their value; they reported $15,000 as a fair value, and he agreed to pay that sum for them, but not by way of compromise of the suit; the trustees did not sell for a sum below their value, or at a price lower than they would have sold to any other person. He completed the purchase in May 1860; <em>“ </em>paid in cash about $5000, and gave a mortgage for $10,000 without any personal bond, so little faith had he in the real value of the land; that his intention was, and so he declared to the trustees in his negotiations for the purchase, and repeatedly to the plaintiffs, or some of them, to embark in the purchase for the benefit of his wife and the plaintiffs, children of Warder Cresson — and at one time he proposed giving them a formal agreement to that effect; but when he found they were utterly unable to assist him, pecuniarily or otherwise, in the management of the lands, he was unwilling to place himself under any legal or equitable obligation to them, and declined to do so, and so repeatedly told them; but still he assured them that he would do as he had proposed to do, viz.: <em>give </em>them a share in the net proceeds, <em>not as a matter of right, </em>but only as a matter of family affection; and that for these promises and declared purposes there never was the slightest consideration; they were purely voluntary offers of his own.” He agreed to give Carscaddon, whom he appointed to take care of the lands, one-third of them when sold, but Carscaddon was in no sense the agent of the plaintiff. The lands were a heavy burden to him ; he had to advance and borrow large sums of money to meet demands on him from them; and the plaintiffs did not contribute or offer to contribute anything to aid him; within four or five years of the purchase he offered to several persons to share the speculation with him upon payment of a proportionate part of the outlay, and to one to sell the whole title on these terms; his offers were declined. The completion of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad to the lands, the <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>close of the war, and the change in the whole circumstances of the country, afterwards gave increased value to the lands. A large part of the forfeited $10,000 was applied to improvement of the lands; large gains were not made from timber, &amp;c., on them, but loss was sustained, éxcept so far as the proceeds were applied to their improvement. He sold to Pardee in the fall of 1866 for $100,000, but did not realize the purchase-money until November 1867, and “ then in fulfilment of his promise he offered to give the plaintiffs what he esteemed to be a full proportion of the net proceeds, which they declined to accept.” He offered to permit them to examine the accounts of his agent; he rendered them no formal account; but he denied that he rendered them no account.'</p>

The time is passing beyond which it will not be possible to appeal, and as some of the trustees have no confidence in the ability to carry out the will in reference to them in a way to do much good — and this I think is a true and just opinion — I have assumed to pay the necessary charges, and given a fee to Mr. Campbell, and he engages to take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. It may not amount to anything, but in that base you will not have any costs; but if it does, it will be proper to tax you and the rest of the family with their share. The arrangement your Aunt Sarah and I agreed to with the attorney was to unite the claim of her as the legal heir, with all the children of brother Warder as residuary legatee (he being cut off by the will), and as a just arrangement to make it without a trial of ownership afterward. This was done, as I suppose you know, in the previous trial, and I suppose it is best in this. If they sell the lands for the taxes, as it is to be apprehended will be the result, I will hold myself liable to you if you authorize me to buy them for the heirs (and I can raise the money), to the same division of them as if awarded by suit, Mr. Coppinger will send you in.a few days a power of attorney from Mr. Campbell, authorizing him to appeal for you, which please sign before a <em>Utiited States Commissioner </em>and return <em>as soon as </em>possible.’ * * *</p>

Whether or not he originally intended this proposition as made by him ‘ as an independent purchaser,’ that is, as made by himself alone for himself alone; it is very clear from the evidence that the trustees did not consider him as such or deal with him as such, nor did he as such carry on the negotiations with them. He and they could not agree as to terms, and two appraisers were selected to designate a price for which it would he advisable for the trustees to sell, <em>not </em>to Dr. Dickey, but ‘ to <em>parties representing the legal heirs of the said Elliott Cresson,’ </em>and these appraisers on April 6th I860, reported ‘that a fair valuation of the said lands, <em>under all the cireumstances, </em>would be the sum of $15,000. * * * It may be fairly and reasonably inferred that the difficulties in which the trustees were involved, and that the purchasers were to be, not strangers, but representatives of the testator’s family, who were claiming a title to the property, were at least among the circumstances that thus controlled their opinion. <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>and, if so, induced them to fix a lower price upon the lands than they would otherwise have done.

It certainly was not understood by the plaintiffs or the trustees, nor was there anything then said or done by Dr. Dickey which would give them to understand that the interest of the plaintiffs in the purchase was to be a mere matter of favor and not a matter of right. That the plaintiffs did not so understand it, is manifest from the correspondence between them and Dr. Dickey, and that the trustees did not so understand it, is clear from the whole dealings between them and Dr. Dickey. It is clear that the sale was made to him as the representative of the family, and that excepting as such representative it would not have been made to him at all at that time or on such favorable terms, and that entering into the consideration for it and of it were, among other things, the settlement of the controversy between the trustees and the family and a beneficiary purpose in favor of the family, and especially of the plaintiffs, who were deemed peculiarly unfortunate. If, then, the letter of May 18th 1860, shall not be read as an informal declaration or confession of a trust, assumed and imposed at the time'and supported by abundant consideration, it seems to the master that Dr. Dickey must be held accountable on other grounds; that is, as a trustee by construction of law. One class of this sort of trusts, and it may be proved by parol, is where the acquisition of the legal estate is tainted with bad faith. The rule of the authorities is that if a person gets property which otherwise he would not have got at all, or gets it at a better bargain than he would otherwise have got it, by representing that he will hold it or use it or is purchasing it for another, equity will turn him into a trustee, ‘ to get at him,’ and <em>a jfortiori </em>if a confidential relation exists between the parties, or the party by the influence of whose name the title has been acquired had a previous interest in it or claim to it. * * * Now, it seems to the master that this rule may be properly applied to the present case, if Dr. Dickey, dealing as the representative of the family with the trustees and making the purchase under the circumstances here disclosed, only intended that whether or not the plaintiffs should have any interest in the property or its proceeds, should be optional with himself, and if they should have any interest at all, it should be only such interest as he might choose as a matter of grace to bestow upon them.” * * *</p>

It is not shown or even pretended that Mr. Pardee was induced to make the purchase by the real or represented superiority of the Dickey tracts, and there is nothing in the proofs, from which it can be conclusively inferred, <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>that he would have bought these tracts alone, or the Cresson tracts alone, or paid more for the former and less for the latter, than at the rate he agreed to pay and did pay for the whole. He paid $100,000 for the whole, comprising seventy-six tracts of an ascertained number of acres each, apparently without regard to the comparative value of any particular acres or tracts. In this condition of things, where no distinction is made as to the respective values of the component parts of a body of land purchased as a whole, there is no rule of law or equity with which the master is acquainted, which would authorize or justify a distinction as to the purchase-money, and settled law of the relation between Dr. Dickey and the plaintiffs will not permit him to derive any especial individual advantage from the bargain in this case. The whole tract sold to Mr. Pardee • contained 31,563 acres and 32 perches, of which the four tracts owned by Dr. Dickey contained 1676 acres, and the 72 tracts of the Cresson land contained 29,887 acres and 32 perches, and in the proportion of the Cresson land to the whole land, he has been charged with the purchase-money.”</p>

Mr. Carskaddon introduced Messrs. Davids and Speering, as competent parties for the purpose,' who were willing to undertake the business, but not, as it would seem, on the sole credit of McLean, a stranger to them, and Carskaddon engaged to be responsible for him. They were on the land for weeks making examinations, and McLean paid them by a draft, endorsed by Carskaddon, on a Mr. Page of Boston, for or with whom McLean was acting in the purchase. This draft was discounted at the bank in Lock Haven, but before it was paid, Page died, and the bank placed it in the hands of their attorney for collection. It has not been paid, nor does it appear that any steps have been taken to exact payment from Carskaddon, but it is contended, nevertheless, that as Carskaddon, and therefore Dr. Dickey, is liable for the amount thereof, the credit should be allowed. Why? It is not shown beyond doubt that Carsdaddon’s liability was not assumed rather for the accommodation of McLean, to enable him to sell to advantage to others, than to assist him to. complete his own purchase and thus benefit the trust. And conceding the principle, that a trustee is as fully entitled to credit for money for which he is liable as for money actually paid in furtherance of the trust, it is evident that such liability must be, not a primary, but an ulti<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>mate liability. The ultimate liability for this debt rests upon McLean or Page’s estate, or, it may be, on both; and it has not been shown that they are, or either of them is, insolvent, and that therefore the defendants must ultimately be obliged to pay. And again, the master has not been able to satisfy himself that a trust estate should, in any event, respond for a liability of this sort, and „he has accordingly disallowed the credit.</p>

A few indisputable, and indeed, undisputed facts, have led a majority of the court to the conclusion that Dr. Dickey did then occupy a confidential relation to the plaintiff; that he had that “ community of interest,” which, in the language of Chief Justice Lewis(1 Casey 272), “produces community of duty.”</p>

John E. Cresson, then a citizen of New Jersey, on October 16th 1856, filed a bill in equity in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against the executors and trustees, the heirs at law, and the rest of the residuary legatees, charging that the devise to the trustees was invalid, and that by reason thereof, the said lands constituted a part of the residuary estate. The defendant and his wife answered, that they were advised that the devise was invalid, as alleged, but charged that the . testator died intestate as to said lands. According to the report of the master, it seems to have been informally agreed between the parties contesting the validity of the devise, that, if it should be decided to be void, whatever might be their respective rights, Sarah E. Dickey, as the only surviving sister of the testator, should have one-half, and the children of Warder Cresson. should have the other half of the lands. On the 9th of October 1857, the said bill, after argument, was dismissed, the court deciding in favor of the validity of the trust. As far as it appears, the community of interest created by the previous agreement between the .plaintiffs then ended. Warder Cresson was then alive. His . children, the plaintiffs, were not tenants in common, as heirs at law, with the defendant. Mrs. Dickey, however, as heir at law, was a tenant in common with her brother Warder, of whatever title there might be in them to these lands'. It is unnecessary to consider what the effect in equity of a purchase by Dr. Dickey would have been at that time as to Warder Cresson, who, by the express terms of the codicil, was excluded from any benefit in the estate: “ In no event shall any portion of my estate be diverted from the object designated for the benefit of said Warder Cresson.” We may concede that after the decree of the court, Dr. Dickey and his wife were strangers to the plaintiffs, and had no community of interest which could lay the foundation for a relation of confidence. Had Dr. Dickey rested there, he might have purchased the lands for the benefit of his wife exclusively, and having paid <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>his own or her money, no declaration, not supported by a consideration, or under seal, which imports a consideration, whether such declaration had been verbal, or evidenced by writing, would have constituted him a trustee for the plaintiffs. If he had intended, and so communicated to the plaintiffs that he would divide the net proceeds of the sales and lands, after the payment of expenses, if they contributed nothing in time, labor or money, which would constitute a sufficient consideration, it would have been a nude pact not enforceable in equity. What occurred afterwards, however, placed him in a different position. The defendant was not content to accept the decree of' the Circuit Court of the United States against the title which had been set -up in the bill in equity. He assumed to act on behalf of John E. Cresson — the plaintiff in the Circuit Court — and retained counsel to prosecute an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. He communicated what he had done to John E. Cresson, by letter dated August 10th 1859. “ I have assumed to pay the necessary charges, and given a fee to Mr. Campbell, and he engages to take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. It may not amount to anything, but in that case you will not have any costs; but if it does, it will be proper to tax you and the rest of the family with their share. The arrangement your Aunt Sarah (Mrs. Dickey) and I agreed to with the attorney, was to unite the claim of her as the legal heir, with all the children of brother Warder as residuary legatees (he being cut off by the will,) and as a just arrangement, to make it without a trial of ownership afterwards. This was done, as I suppose you know, in the previous trial, and I suppose it is best in this.” What had thus been done was ratified by John E. Cresson, acting for himself and the other plaintiffs, by a letter to Dr. Dickey, dated September 1st 1869, in which he said: “I trust that we may be successful in the undertaking; as it would be very unpleasant to us all to have a trial with Aunt Sarah for the ownership of the lands, it is with pleasure we accede to the plan you propose.” Surely here was an agreement founded upon sufficient consideration; the defendant, Dr. Dickey, agreeing to conduct and be at the costs of the appeal in the event of failure, and the plaintiffs agreeing, in consideration thereof, to abandon their claim as residuary legatees, and come in equally with Mrs. Dickey as heirs at law in case of eventual success. Dr. Dickey avers that he afterwards abandoned this appeal, but it is clear that after this agreement he had no right to do so without the consent of the other parties. He had constituted his wife a tenant in common in equity with them of the title, such as it was. Mrs. Dickey, with his consent, might release her own share or interest to the trustees, but Dr. Dickey was, nevertheless, bound to go on with that appeal until he was released by the other parties from the obligation he had assumed with them, and for which they had <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>given value in their release of their rights as residuary legatees. It is entirely immaterial, so far as any question before us is concerned, whether the title they thus set up in opposition to the trustees of the will, was good or bad, was perfect or worthless; whether, if the trust was bad, the heirs at law would have the lands, or the residuary legatees. The relation of Mrs. Dickey, and as standing in her shoes, of Dr. Dickey, to the other parties, cannot be affected by that consideration. That Dr. Dickey, then considered that he stood in this relation to the plaintiffs, is manifest, we think, from the terms of his formal proposal in writing made to the trustees for the purchase. He says that he is willing, “on behalf of the heirs at law of Mr. Cresson,” to pay the amount at which they were appraised by Messrs. P. M. Price and Stone, and he subscribes his name “for Sarah E. Cresson, his wife, and residuary legatees mentioned in the will of Elliott Cresson.” If then Mrs. Dickey was in equity a tenant in common with the plaintiffs, any purchase made by her, or by her husband in her behalf, of the outstanding title in the trustees, must enure to the benefit of her co-tenants at their election. In Smiley <em>v. </em>Dixon, 1 Penna. R. 441, Huston, J., refers to the case of Legget <em>v. </em>Bechtol, which is not reported, in which it was decided by this court that two tenants in common, who had heard of an adverse title, and agreed to join in defence against it, were bound to deal fairly with each other, and that one of them, who purchased the adverse title, must hold it for the other, upon that other paying his proportion of the purchase-money. So in Weaver <em>v. </em>Wible, 1 Casey 270, it was held that a conveyance to one of several tenants in common, or a deed to one of two devisees of the same land, shall enure to the benefit of all who come in under the same title, and are holding jointly or in common. To the same effect is Lloyd <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 Casey 419, and Keller <em>v. </em>Auble, 8 P. F. Smith 410. In answer to a letter of John E. Cresson, of May 4th 1860, who, it seems, had heard of the purchase, and wrote to inquire about it, Dr. Dickey, under date of May Í8th 1860, replied as follows: “ The title I took without having your brother associated in it, because the person furnishing the money to purchase, and running the risk, must necessarily have the property in his right as <em>security; and </em>again, your brother cannot give you such security in a contract to the proper execution of his part as one having other property can do, so that the danger is only to myself. I expect to sign a paper to be left with your mother, as representing her children, so soon as I get the deeds recorded, binding myself and heirs, to give your brothers and sisters the one-half of all the net proceeds from the property, and your Aunt Sarah, for our children, the other half, after paying purchase-money, interest and expenses of every kind, which must first come out of all sales of lands and timber.” It will be observed that he <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>made no condition that the plaintiffs should advance' any part of the purchase-money, but distinctly proposed to depend for his reimbursement upon the sales of lands and timber. He stated also in this same letter that he made this purchase of the trustees by way of compromise of the pending appeal by the advice of the counsel whom he had retained for the heirs. “Your lawyer, Mr. Campbell, as well as my own, told me to make any compromise I could with the trustees, as there was everything to fear, if we Went to the Supreme Court, that it would result as the former did, against us.” Whether, therefore, Dr. Dickey be regarded as acting for his wife as tenant in common, and having himself a curtesy estate in her share, or as attorney in fact of the other parties, in prosecuting their appeal, in either view he occupied a confidential relation, and any purchase made by him must be held in equity to enure to them and according to their respective shares. We are therefore of opinion that Dr. Dickey was a trustee, and the decree below that he should account as such was right.</p>

We think Dr. Dickey should be credited with the fair market value of his own lands, which were included in the sale. It is altogether immaterial how Mr. Pardee, the purchaser, regarded it, and whether he viewed the lands in person. This is not the ordinary case of a person executing an express trust, where it may be said that it was the plain duty of the trustee to keep his own lands separate from those of his cestui que trust. Dr. Dickey was not a lawyer, and not acquainted with the doctrines of courts of equity upon the subject of constructive trusts. He was advised by his counsel that he was not a trustee, and the division of opinion upon this bench may at least show that it was not a clear case. He held himself bound <em>in foro consoientice </em>only. It would be a hard measure of equity to visit him with the loss of his own lands or their value, because, supposing himself not legally accountable to any one, he made a lumping sale of his own land with the lands of the cestui que trust. There is no difficulty in separating and distinguishing them, and so far from the Clinton county lands having been injured by this confusion, if we may judge by the testimony of the witnesses as to the actual value of the Clinton county lands, compared with what they were sold for by Dr. Dickey, they were very much benefited. Nor is there any difficulty in determining the value of these lands. The only witness who speaks of it from actual knowledge is Mr. Carskaddon, and he was an entirely competent expert. He says: “ These lands are very favorable specimens, worth from $10 to $15, or $20 an acre.” We lay aside what Dr. Dickey says, as evidently mere conjecture. Taking then $14 as an average for 1676 acres, deducting $3.16 per acre, the amount at which he is already credited^ <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>and crediting Mm with the same proportion on the forfeit of Ward McLean, it will be found, without calculating the precise arithmetical result, that if Dr. Dickey be credited with these sums, the amount due the plaintiffs is somewhat less than that brought out on the first statement of Dr. Dickey, dated December 24th 1866, and offered to be paid by him, namely: $16,274.10. We think the decree below ought to be so modified as to find this amount to be due and payable to the plaintiffs, with such an order as to the costs as will be just and equitable.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[354,769,986,432]]]'>And now it is ordered and decreed that the defendant, John M. Dickey, pay to each of the plaintiffs, John E. Cresson, Clement Cresson, Ezra T. Cresson, Annabella McAllister, Emma Porter and Emma J. Cresson, as executors of Jacob Cresson, deceased, the sum of ¡§2712.35 cents, with interest from November 14th 1866; that each party pay Ms own costs in the court below ; that the appeal of the plaintiffs be dismissed at the costs of the appellants, and that the costs of the appeal of John M. Dickey be paid by the appellees.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[179,1242,1157,87]]]'>Williams and Mbrcur, JJ., concurred in the modification of the decree, but would go further and dismiss the bill.</p>
