He said, let it be sold as low as it could. If she could not make this arrangement I was to bid off all the property, and she should have the homestead. I would have bid $1250 for the property. I saw Mrs. Housler the day before the sale, or day of the sale, and she told me not to bid. I did not bid. I forbid the sale at Simpson’s request, he saying if I showed my deed the sale would go low. About the time I heard Mr. Boynton was going to buy it I had a talk with him, and I told him that by an arrangement with the widow, and Simpson, she was to have the little homestead.

The defendant, who is the widow of Housler, made defence to a portion of land called “ The Homestead,” containing about eighteen acres. Prior to, and at the time of, the sheriff’s sale, the defendant and her minor children were in the actual possession of the whole property. She had entered into a contract to purchase it from Aden Housler, who held a deed for it subject to the payment of the judgments.

Upon the day next preceding the sale Simpson, who was the plaintiff in the execution, was informed of this arrangement between Aden Housler and the defendant. He then said to them if they would not interfere or bid at the sale, and have it bid off as low as possible, that she should have the homestead; she should not get any bidders, and he would get some one to bid it off; that would be better than for her to bid it off. The defendant and Aden agreed to this proposition. Relying upon it they did not interfere nor bid at the <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>sale; nor did she get any other person to bid for her.

In Morey <em>v. </em>Herrick, 6 Harris 128, Justice Bell said, “ It is equally well settled that if one be induced to confide in the promise of another, that he will hold in trust, or that he will so purchase for one or both, and is thus led to do what otherwise he would have forborne, or to forbear what he contemplated to do, in the acquisition of an estate, whereby the promissor becomes the holder of the legal title; an attempted denial of the confidence is such a fraud as will operate to convert the purchaser into a trustee <em>ex maleficio.” </em>Where one holding an article of agreement for one hundred and sixteen acres of land, upon which he had paid five dollars only, and was liable to be turned off, surrendered his title under a parol contract that ten acres thereof should be conveyed to him so soon as the person for whose benefit he gave up his title acquired a deed for the legal title, it was held to create a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>in his favor as to the ten acres: Plumer &amp; Crary <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%2046" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wright 46">2 Wright 46</a>.

The case of Beegle <em>v. </em>Wentz was one in which a debtor was induced to relinquish his claim to the $300 exemption, and consented that the whole of his land be sold, under an agreement that the plaintiff was to take a sheriff’s deed for the same and make to the debtor a deed for the part agreed upon. It was held that if the debtor was induced to surrender his right on the false assurance that the part should be left to him, the plaintiff refusing, was a trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>This was since the Act of April 22d 1856, and was held to be such a trust or confidence as was not affected by that act. The same principle is affirmed in Seichrist’s Appeal, 16 P. F. Smith 237.</p>

That was an agreement between two persons, neither of whom had any possession of or interest in the land.
