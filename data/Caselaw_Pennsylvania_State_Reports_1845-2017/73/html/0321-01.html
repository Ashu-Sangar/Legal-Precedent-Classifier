We find the same rule in 1 Phillips &amp; Arnold’s Evidence, pp. 306-7, and in 1 Pitt Taylor on Evidence, 4th edition, 1864, pp. 445 447. Dr. Wharton, in his valuable Treatise on Criminal Law in the United States, vol. 1, p. 667, says: “ The testimony of a deceased witness given at a former trial or examination, may be proved at a subsequent trial by persons who heard him testify. Even the notes of counsel of the testimony of such witness on a former trial between the same parties, touching the same subject-matter, are evidence when proved to be correct in substance, although the counsel does not recollect the testimony independently of his notes. The better opinion seems to be that it is sufficient to prove the substance of what the deceased witness said, provided the material particulars are stated, though it has been sometimes held, that unless the precise words could be given, the testimony would be rejected.”</p>

It in truth excludes the thing it proposes to admit, and at the same time opens a door for knaves to enter, where honest men cannot approach.” “ Other learned judges have maintaned, that a rule so rigid was unwise, and I confess, I prefer the reasoning of Gibson, J., in the ease of Cornell <em>v. </em>Green, 10 S. &amp; R. 16, to that of the learned judge in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Richards, and with him agrees also the learned author of the Treatise on the Law of Evidence.” 1 Greenl. § 165.</p>

At the preliminary examination, a witness, since deceased, testified in relation to the offence, which was robbing the mail. The accused was present and his counsel cross-examined the witness. Witnesses were permitted on a trial before a jury, under an indictment found for the same offence, to prove what the deceased witness testified to at the preliminary examination.

Kraemer and his wife were both advanced in years and there was no doubt that robbery of gold and silver which was known to be in the house led to their murder, but we do not see any facts that would bring these dying declarations of Mrs. Kraemer within those two authorities, supposing them to be good law.</p>
