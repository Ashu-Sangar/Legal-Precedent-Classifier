It extends only to private roads existing by prescription or lapse of time, and not to private roads resting upon express grant, drawing a clear line between the two kinds of title. The latter title is founded upon contract, the former upon mere lapse of time, by an uninterrupted use of it for more than twenty-one years, by analogy to the Statute of Limitations. This is the true title to such an easement, and not the fiction of a grant which has sometimes been resorted to as a reason for such a right, gained only by prescription or by adverse user for a long period of time. We must therefore be governed by the former decision in the case before us. It is not intended in any way to affect vested rights, or to trench in any manner upon property protected by the Statute of Limitations.</p>
