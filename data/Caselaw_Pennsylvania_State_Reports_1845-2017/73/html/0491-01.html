Is it not plain to the comprehension and understanding of men of ordinary capacity and intelligence? Was it not intended to make it the duty of the purchaser to keep the railroad and canal open as a highway, in good repair and operating condition, for the use and enjoyment of all parties whatsoever ‘ desiring to use and enjoy the same ?’ Can there be the least shadow of doubt as to the meaning of the legislature in declaring that said railroad and canal shall be and remain for ever ‘ a public highway,’ and that the same shall be kept up in good repair and operating condition, for the use and enjoyment of all parties desiring to use and enjoy the same ? Does it need an Act of Assembly to teach us what these words -mean, and what the legislature intended by their use ? One would hardly think so; and yet, for some reason or other, the legislature of 1864 seems to have thought that there might have been some doubt as to their <em>true intent </em>and meaning; and in order to remove the doubt, to make their true intent and meaning plain, they passed an act entitled, ‘An Act relating to certain canals,’ approved May 3d 1864.” The judge here quoted the act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-6" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[285,1285,1165,1164]],["BL_495.1",495,[133,363,1174,1850]]]'>“ Now, what is the meaning of this explanatory act, this ‘ Act relating to certain canals ?’ Does it mean to declare that it was not ‘ the true intent and meaning of the fifth section of the Act of 1857,’ that the purchaser shall be bound to keep up in good repair and operating condition, the line of said railroad and canal, for the use and enjoyment of all parties desiring to use and enjoy the same, or that it should not be and remain a public highway, as provided in the original act ? It does not in terms so declare. Does it mean, as contended, that the purchaser is only bound to keep the canal in the same condition as the company received it at the time of its sale and transfer by the state ? If at that time the canal was, in point of fact, in the condition in which it has been described by the defendant’s counsel, that is to say, ‘ in a bad, dilapidated condition — dilapidated to the last degree,’ does it mean that the purchaser was only bound to keep it in that condition ? [If the canal was wholly out of repair in some portions, and totally unfit for navigation, did the legislature of 1864 intend to declare that the whole duty of the purchaser, under the Act of 1857, would be performed and discharged by keeping the canal in the same dilapidated and ruinous condition, and that their whole and only duty was to prevent it from falling into further ruin and decay? Whatever may have been the purpose and intent of the framer of this explanatory act, I cannot think that it was the intent of the legislature in passing it, or that this is its meaning.} We cannot impute to the legislature any such absurdity as to suppose that they intended that if any portion of the canal was out of repair and unfit for use at the time of its sale and transfer to <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>the company, the purchaser, although "expressly required to keep it open as a highway for the use of all persons desiring to use it, might allow it to remain in that unfit and ruined condition for ever. What then is the meaning of this explanatory act ? Was it intended to lower the standard of duty imposed by the original act, or was it intended to define the duty with more precision and with greater certainty, without lowering the standard ? [It seems to me that if the legislature had intended to lower the standard, and to relieve the company from the duty imposed on it by the original act, they would have said so in plain and express terms, leaving no room for doubt as to their meaning. It would have been easy for ■ the legislature, if they had so intended, to declare that the purchaser shall not be bound to keep the canal or any part of it in a better condition than it was at the time of its sale and transfer by the state. But the legislature did not so declare.] Nor did they declare that the purchaser shall not be bound to keep the canal in good repair and operating condition. If, then, the legislature did not intend to relieve the company from the duty imposed by the original act, of keeping the canal in good repair and operating condition, they must have intended to define more specifically the duties imposed by that act. Whether they have succeeded in making the meaning of the provision more plain and palpable to our understanding and apprehension, or whether they “ have darkened counsel by words without knowledge,’ may perhaps admit of doubt; but as we have seen, the legislature of 1864 does say that the Commonwealth (by the fifth section of the Act of May 16th 1857), ‘ does require the purchasers of the main line to keep the canals referred to in said section in a condition of repair and fitness for use which shall, at all times during seasons of navigation, be equal to, and not inferior to, the condition of repair and fitness for use in which the same were at the time the Commonwealth delivered the same into the purchasers’ possession.’ This is a declaratory act, and taking it in connection with the original, the meaning of the whole would seem to be that it shall be the duty of the purchaser to keep up the canal in good repair and operating condition : that ‘ the condition of repair and fitness for use,’ shall, ‘ at all times during seasons of navigation, be equal to, and not inferior to, the condition of repair and fitness for use in which the same was at the time the Commonwealth delivered it into the purchasers’ possession.’ But ‘the said canal shall be and remain a public highway, and be kept open and in repair by the purchaser, for the use and enjoyment of all parties desiring to use and enjoy the same.’</p>

And this duty attached to the company and became binding on it as soon as it received possession of the canal. The duty was immediate as it respects the obligation, though it was not as it respects the time of its performance. If the mechanical structures of the canal, the dams, locks and gates were in the state of decay and ruin described by some of the witnesses, and if the pools and levels were obstructed with mud, gravel and debris, brought down by the flood, it is manifest that the canal could not be put in good repair immediately and at once. A work of such magnitude and difficulty, would require time for its completion; but it was the duty of the company to begin the work as soon as it was reasonably practicable, and prosecute it with diligence and vigor until it was finished. It was their right and duty to employ skilful and competent engineers to examine the canal, in order to ascertain its condition, and, if found to be out of repair and unfit for use, to report the nature and character of the repairs necessary in order to render the canal navigable and fit for use. The company would then be entitled to a reasonable time in which to make the necessary repairs, and it would be their right and duty so to perform the work as to cause as little interruption to the navigation as possible, consistent with reasonable and proper diligence in the prosecution of the work. If, then, the company commenced making the repairs as soon as it was reasonably practicable, if it prosecuted the work with diligence, and completed it within a reasonable time considering its magnitude, the difficulty of procuring the necessary workmen and materials, and the exigencies of the navigation, then the company wras not guilty of negligence, but performed the whole duty imposed upon it by the law, and is not responsible for the loss sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the bad condition of the canal. The gist of the plaintiff’s action is the alleged negligence of the company in not keeping the canal in good repair and operating condition; and if the company was guilty of no negligence, it is not to be visited with the plaintiff’s losses, though occasioned by the want of repair and bad condition of the canal. Nor is the company responsible for the consequences of unavoidable accidents to the canal, caused by sudden storms and floods (unless they might have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence in keeping the works in proper repair), if they were repaired as soon as it was reasonably practicable. But if the company did not commence the work of repair within a reasonable and proper time, considering all the circumstances of the case, or if they did not prosecute it with reasonable and proper skill and diligence, and if the plaintiff sustained loss and damage by reason of the defendant’s default and negligence in this respect, then he is entitled to recover such damages as he may have sustained.</p>

But if it was greatly out of repair along the whole length of its- line, it was not a work which could be performed in a day or in a Aveek or in a month, and the company had a right to a reasonable time within which to have it first inspected along its whole line by competent engineers, in order to form an estimate of what was necessary to be done; and before they did anything, it was very proper for them to send engineers along the line to examine the state of the canal, and to report its condition, and see exactly what was necessary to be done in order to put it into proper order. Now, did the company do that ? And after the engineers had had sufficient time to ascertain that, to a reasonable time within which to begin the work. Did they commence within a reasonable time afterwards to do the work, considering the difficulty of procuring materials, of procuring workmen, and the state of the season, and all that.
