The 1976 Plan calls for an intensive planning and refinement of the Plan’s components during the school year 1977-78, followed by implementation of the following programs beginning with the school year 1978-79: magnet schools; an open enrollment/voluntary transfer program; inter-system cooperation between the public and parochial schools; and the creation of skill centers and other new or expanded programs. Certain of these programs would involve participating students in integrated settings for some but not all of their school days. Participation in all of these programs would be left to the individual choice of the students and their parents. The 1976 Plan contained projections of the numbers of students that the School District anticipated might participate in the different Plan elements. Given the voluntary character of the Plan and its elements, the 1976 Plan could not identify with certainty the degree of desegregation that would result from its implementation; the District’s projections, however, reflect a potential desegregating impact on anywhere from 70,000 to 160,000 of the District’s 265,000 students over the course of the 1976 Plan’s implementation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> The Plan did not indicate what response the School District would have if the various program elements failed to secure a degree of desegregation which it deemed satisfactory.</p>

With respect to magnet schools, Dr. Foster testified that “the possibilities of considerable desegregation over a period of time certainly would be fair in this program.” He further testified that he believed the School District’s estimate of 40,000 potentially affected students was “pretty optimistic” because of the locations of the schools which had been tentatively suggested as magnet schools. With respect to open enrollment and voluntary transfers, Foster testified that programs of that type had traditionally drawn no more than 3% to 5% of a district’s pupils; that range, if accomplished, would coincide with the lower range of the School District’s own estimate of the potential for this phase of the program. Dr. Foster testified that the District’s proposed inter-system and shared-time programs would affect a small number of students and in his opinion did not involve genuine school desegregation but simply part-time desegregation. Finally, Dr. Foster testified that of- the balance of the proposed educational components, the “academics plus” program offered some effective solution to desegregation but that the remaining programs had not been sufficiently worked out to allow a reasonable projection of their desegregation effect.</p>

The Kurtzman Report envisioned a year devoted to the development of quality educational programs, physical changes which would accommodate desegregation, in-service training and staff planning, and community involvement; in subsequent years, the Report called for the creation of Educational Services Areas which would in the main embrace student populations of an acceptable racial balance and for the reorganization of the District’s schools on a basis of grades (i. e., kindergarten to 4th grade, fifth to eighth grade, and ninth to twelfth grade). The Report recommended no significant desegregation for schools in Educational Service Areas which embraced roughly 25% of the school population.

The Commission’s plan was an attempt to maximize desegregation consistent with the constraint of limiting transportation of any student to a bus trip which would not exceed 45 minutes a day, each way to and from school. The Commission’s plan utilized the District’s existing School Planning Areas as the basic component of its reorganization and called for the mandatory assignment of students on a random basis to schools within such Areas to achieve desegregated schools. In view of the transportation constraint which the Commission accepted, certain areas of the School District which accounted for roughly 15% of the school population would not be affected by the Commission’s plan. The Commission estimated that implementation of the proposed plan would entail the reassignment of approximately 40,000 elementary school students and the transportation of roughly 53,000 elementary and middle school students for distances in excess of IV2 miles. As noted by the Commonwealth Court, the Commission’s plan would actually have increased the number of schools that had a black student population in excess of 60%.</p>

First, the language of the statute gives rise to an inference that the court should confine its consideration to the record as developed during the proceedings before the agency. I do not accept the majority’s liberal interpretation which would permit the Commonwealth Court to take additional testimony. Second, there is nothing in the Act that suggests that the Commonwealth Court is at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. As has been stated, the legislature clearly intended that the Commission serve as an organ to ferret out and eradicate discriminatory practices. If we interpret section 10 as allowing the Commonwealth Court to have a scope of review beyond the substantial evidence test, we are therefore again relegating the Commission to an advisory capacity only and <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>vesting in the court the ultimate judgment in these matters.

When we consider that the discussions relating to the racial imbalance among the students within the District began in 1968, it becomes apparent that a decade has passed without a resolution of this urgent problem.

Indeed the way to attack discrimination in housing and employment may be to begin with a program of quality integrated education. The best way to demonstrate the ‘inherent worth of [one’s] neighbor’ is to place individuals in a situation where they are exposed to their neighbor. This is especially true if a child can become aware of his neighbors’ capabilities before his prejudices have had a chance to develop, but inter-racial cooperation may also have a beneficial effect on the thinking of adults. Thus, participation in such school activities as the P.T.A. may promote a better understanding which is the crucial first step toward the achievement of a truly integrated society.

The sincerity of the District is best gleaned from the plan offered by it in response to the Commonwealth Court’s order of October 1, 1974. This plan called for the creation of a Metropolitan School District embracing Philadelphia and school districts in adjacent counties. The political obstacles in such a proposal should have been apparent to even the most naive.</p>

      <blockquote id="ABl" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[275,1342,1087,499]]]'>“The argument that the Commission’s order will destroy the neighborhood school system completely distorts the historical rationale of neighborhood schools. Traditionally, the neighborhood school has been an exercise in democracy, ‘a single structure serving a heterogeneous community in which children of varied racial, cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds were taught together — -the proverbial melting pot.’ One educator has recalled: ‘Most men and women over 40 recall a childhood schooling in which the sons and daughters of millowners, shop proprietors, professional men, and day laborers attended side by side. School boundaries, reaching out into fields and hills to embrace the pupil population, transcended such socio-economic clusterings as existed.’</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="A3p" data-blocks='[["BL_575.8",575,[274,1852,1089,506]]]'>However, increasing population density in our nation’s urban areas have caused neighborhoods to shrink drastically until today convenience is the most common justification for school attendance zones. Thus, ‘because of rigid racial and socio-economic stratification, ethnic and class similarity has become the most salient present-day neighborhood characteristic, particularly in urban areas. The neighborhood school, which encompasses a homogeneous racial and socio-economic grouping, as is true today, is the very antithesis of the common school heritage.’ Rather than neighborhood schools, we have all too frequently developed a system of ghetto schools. Integration need not see the demise of neighborhood schooling, although unquestionably new patterns of districting will have to occur.”</blockquote>

The majority reaches its result on the jurisdiction question relying on the implicit premise that the enforcement proceeding under section 10 is an independent, separate and distinct proceeding. If, however, you view the entire proceeding as commencing with the administrative action below (conciliation, conference, complaint, hearing and order) the appeal of that order and the subsequent enforcement, the majority reasoning appears erroneous.</p>
