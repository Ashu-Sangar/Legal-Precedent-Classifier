Specifically, we are concerned with a certificate of deposit purchased with funds of the decedent, Florence T. Young, from the First National Bank of Mercer County (“the bank”) and issued by the bank in the joint names of (Mrs.) Florence T. Young and her daughter (Mrs.) Bernice Y. Kitch (“Bernice” or “Mrs. Kitch”). Mrs. Young has died, and the amount of the deposit was later paid by the bank to her daughter, Mrs. Kitch, as survivor of the two depositors. The decedent’s son, Myron M. Young (“Myron”), the appellee, who along with his sister, Bernice, is a residuary legatee under Mrs. Young’s will, contends that there was no completed gift to Mrs. Kitch of a present joint interest in the certificate of deposit and that therefore the certificate was an asset of his mother’s estate. The court below agreed, and awarded the certificate or its proceeds to the estate. We do not agree, and will reverse.</p>

Myron presented no testimony at the hearing, and offered no documentary evidence other than photocopies of the certificate and the signature card. Thus the fundamental question presented to the court was whether the intrinsic evidence of Mrs. Young’s donative intent supplied by the signature card and the provisions on the face of the certificate was so equivocal as to place on Mrs. Kitch, the putative donee, the burden of establishing <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>the requisite donative intent by independent evidence. See generally, <em>Furjanick Estate, <a href="/pa/375/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="375 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1244355" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0484-01">375 </a></em><a href="/pa/375/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="375 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1244355" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0484-01">Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%2085" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="100 A.2d 85">100 A.2d 85</a> (1953). The auditing judge answered this question in the affirmative. Mrs. Kitch’s attempts to meet this burden through the testimony of two of Mrs. Young’s neighbors were unavailing, their testimony being ruled inadmissible under the parol evidence rule. We need not pass on the correctness of this ruling, for we conclude that the burden was on Myron to demonstrate that Mrs. Young did not intend to make an immediate gift to her daughter when she purchased the certificate.</p>

We think this conclusion is inconsistent with the court’s ultimate finding, amply supported by the record,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> that the certificate and the signature card were parts of a single, integrated contract between the named depositors and the bank.</p>

The other is “such an actual or constructive delivery to the donee (a) as to divest the donor of all dominion and control, or (b) if a joint tenancy is created, as to invest in the donee so much dominion and control of the subject matter of the gift as is consonant with a joint ownership or interest therein.” <em>Martella Estate, </em><a href="/pa/390/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="390 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1275700" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0255-01">390 Pa. 255</a>, 258-9, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20372" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="135 A.2d 372">135 A.2d 372</a>, 373 (1957) (quoting from earlier cases). The question of delivery was not raised in Myron’s objections to the inventory, and the court made no finding of any sort on this issue. The only direct evidence on the issue was provided by Bernice, who testified over Myron’s objection that Mrs. Young gave Bernice the certificate to place in a safe deposit box rented by Bernice and her husband and that the certificate remained in the box until Mrs. Kitch presented it for payment over a year after Mrs. Young’s death. The auditing judge subsequently ruled this testimony inadmissible under the Dead Man’s Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Again, we need not pass on the correctness of this ruling,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> for we conclude that the burden was on Myron to come forward with prima facie evidence of lack of delivery. Particularly in view of the far-reaching changes <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>wrought in the law by the enactment of Chapter 63 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> we will not prolong this opinion with a discussion of the numerous and often conflicting decisions on this question. We will merely point out that Myron conceded that the certificate was not found in the safe deposit box which Mrs. Young maintained in joint names with Bernice and that there is no doubt that the certificate was in Bernice’s possession subsequent to her mother’s death. Under the circumstances, it was incumbent on Myron, as the party objecting to the omission of the certificate from the inventory, at least to demonstrate that the question of delivery presented a genuine issue of fact.
