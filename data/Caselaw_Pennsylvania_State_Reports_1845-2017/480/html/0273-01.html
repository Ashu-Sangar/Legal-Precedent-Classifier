The motion for certification was granted and the appeal was allowed by the Superior Court. The Superior Court reversed the trial court’s order and quashed the indictment on the ground that the substitution of six grand jurors, more than one year after the investigating grand jury had been sworn, and at a time when the number of grand jurors still sitting equalled seventeen (two more than needed for a quorum), was unauthorized, and therefore invalidated the Fourteenth Presentment and consequent indictment.</p>

The reconstituted 1974 Investigating Grand Jury then continued its investigation and proceedings. Thereafter, two more of the original jurors were excused without substitution.

Initially, it contends that the addition of the six new members to the investigating grand jury on January 15, 1974, was authorized by the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 427, § 41 (17 P.S. § 1152 and § 1233). Secondly, the prosecution argues that even if the addition of the six was not authorized by statute, the supervising judge had inherent discretionary power to add members to the grand jury, and therefore the presence of the additional six members was not unlawful. Furthermore, according to the prosecution, the substituted grand jurors should be afforded <em>de facto </em>legitimacy even if their substitution was unlawful.</p>

    <p id="b412-9" data-blocks='[["BL_412.8",412,[250,1448,1155,735]]]'>The Superior Court correctly concluded that the Act does not provide authority for the substitution. The statutory material cited is clearly inapplicable to a situation such as the one presented here. The statute authorizes the calling of additional persons when the number originally constituting the <em>panel </em>from which the jurors are to be selected dwindles, either because of challenges or other circumstances, to such a point that it becomes too small in number to supply sufficient jurors to make the required twenty-three. The Act authorizes the calling of “talesmen” when “necessary” to provide a sufficiently large panel from which to select the twenty-three members of the grand jury. As stated in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/91/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="488080" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0493-01">91 Pa. 493</a> at 500 (1879):</p>

    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[195,504,1160,1855]]]'>As further illustration of the error of the prosecution’s argument concerning this point, we note that the Act refers to selection of jurors for both petit and grand juries. If, as the prosecution argues, the Act authorizes the summoning of additional grand jurors after the original panel has been sworn, it would similarly authorize the addition of petit juries after the original twelve had been seated and had begun to hear evidence. Such a proposition is so at odds with our concept of trial by jury that its absurdity needs no further comment. The Superior Court correctly observed that the grand jury is so composed as to include “built-in alternates.” <em>Commonwealth v. Levinson, </em><a href="/pa-super/239/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="239 Pa.

With regard to <em>petit juries, </em>the common law rule was to the effect that a discharge of the entire jury was required whenever “. . .a defect in the jurors occurred due to the death of a juror, or [to] the illness or misconduct of a juror, or [to] other cause necessitating [a juror’s] discharge.” Annot. <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.L.R.%202d%201288" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="84 A.L.R. 2d 1288">84 A.L.R.2d 1288</a>, 1290 § 1 (1962). In <em>Pennell v.

American Can and Foundry Co., </em><a href="/pa/209/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="209 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="936144" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0161-01">209 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.%20272" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="58 A. 272">58 A. 272</a> (1904). Pa.R.Cr.P. 1108’s provision for utilization of alternate petit jurors in the event that a mid-trial replacement is necessary avoids the discharge result compelled by the common law rule. By providing that the indicting grand jury have no more than twenty-three, and no less than fifteen, jurors, with twelve constituting the minimum required to return an indictment, see Pa.R.Cr.P. 201 and 210, a provision for alternate <em>grand </em>jurors similar to Rule 1108’s provision for alternate <em>petit </em>jurors becomes unnecessary.

That case is completely inapposite to the issue here. No issue was presented in that case concerning whether citizens could be added and sworn as jurors in the middle of the jury’s deliberations. That case held that a judge was given the authority by Pa.R.Cr.P. 204 to convene a grand jury on his own motion. <em>In Re Investigation of January 1974 Phila. City Gr. Jury, </em>thus has no bearing on whether a judge has authority to add citizens to the jury’s complement after it has been convened, sworn, and has begun its deliberations. Thus, we find no merit in the prosecution’s contention that six were properly added as “jurors” after the original jury had been sworn and had begun its work.</p>

Under the <em>de facto </em>approach, the official acts of one acting under color of title to a public office are given the same effect as the acts of a <em>de jure </em>official and are therefore legally binding until such <em>de facto </em>officials are ousted from office. <em>State Dental Council &amp; Examining Board v. Pollack, </em><a href="/pa/457/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="457 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="477656" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0264-01">457 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="318 A.2d 910">318 A.2d 910</a> (1974). The <em>de facto </em>doctrine, however, is not applicable to the situation before us. When the official acts <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>of a public official are given effect even though it is later held that the official was not authorized to occupy the office, that official has acted <em>de facto, from the beginning of the proceeding </em>which is being challenged. <em>State Dental Council, supra. </em>The situation before us is not such a situation. It is analogous to one in which in the middle of a trial six jurors were excused for illness or hardship and six new persons began sitting as jurors in the middle of the trial. There is no authority to support the proposition that the <em>de facto </em>rule should be applied when such persons act as public officials only for a part of the relevant proceeding. The <em>de facto </em>rule might be applicable if six persons are originally sworn as a member of a grand jury or a trial jury when the jury begins its work but it later develops that such persons were not qualified because they were residents of the wrong county. The situation before us is entirely different. Even if we assume that the <em>de facto </em>rules applies to jurors the six persons involved in this case were <em>de facto </em>for only part of the relevant proceeding. If a <em>de facto </em>— but not <em>de jure </em>—judge were to sit for only the second half of a trial surely his verdict of guilt would not be accepted. Likewise, in this case, we refuse to extend the <em>de facto </em>principle to persons who might have become <em>de facto </em>in the middle of the relevant proceeding.</p>

The Superior Court concluded in the instant case that the presence of six unauthorized grand jurors, who had not seen or heard witnesses who testified during the early phases of the investigation had to be deemed “inherently prejudicial.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Since <em>all the evidence adduced before a grand jury </em>— cer<em>tainly when the accused does not appear </em>— is <em>aimed at proving guilt, </em>the absence of some jurors during some part of the hearings will ordinarily merely weaken the prosecution’s case. If what the absentees actually hear is enough to satisfy them, there would seem to be no reason why they should not vote. <em>Against this we can think of nothing except the possibility that some of the evidence adduced by the prosecution might conceivably turn out to be favorable to the accused; and that, if the absentees had heard it, they might have refused to vote a true bill. </em>No one can be entirely sure that this can never occur; but it appears to us so remote a chance that it should be left to those instances in which it can be made to appear that the evidence not heard was of that character, in spite of <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>the extreme difficulty of ever proving what was the evidence before a grand jury. Indeed, the possibility that not all who vote will hear all the evidence, is a reasonable inference from the fact that sixteen is a quorum. Were the law as the relator argues, it would practically mean that all jurors present at the beginning of any case, must remain to the end, for it will always be impossible to tell in advance whether twelve will eventually vote a true bill, and if they do, who those twelve will be. The result of such a doctrine would therefore be that in a long case, or in a case where there are intervals in the taking of evidence, the privilege of absence would not exist. That would certainly be an innovation, for the contrary practice has, so far as we are aware, been universal; and it would be an onerous and unnecessary innovation.”</blockquote>

First of all, <em>Thompson </em>was concerned with the question of whether prejudice was caused to a defendant by the presence of unauthorized jurors on an indicting grand jury. In the instant case, we are concerned with an investigating grand jury where the alleged guilt of a party is not the primary issue. An investigating grand jury is charged with conducting an investigation into certain areas of suspected criminal activity, and the evidence relative to any one individual under investigation may well contain much that is exculpatory as well as that which is inculpatory. Based on its view of <em>all </em>the evidence — not just that evidence presented by the prosecution — the investigating grand jury may recommend that criminal charges be initiated against any particular individual.</p>

Even if we were to apply the <em>Thompson </em>rationale, it would remain valid only when the collective memory of the grand jury remains intact despite the sporadic absences of various individual members. When a substantial percentage of the total mem<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>bership of the jury is absent from a significant portion of the presentation of evidence, it can no longer be said with confidence that the deliberations were not affected. In the instant case all six of the substituted grand jury members were sworn <em>after </em>defendant Levinson had initially testified before the January 1974 Grand Jury. They were exposed to Levinson’s prior testimony only when that testimony was read to them by one of the prosecuting attorneys. To make matters worse, only those portions of appellee’s prior testimony which the prosecuting attorney deemed “relevant” to the investigation were read to the reconstituted panel. Based on this reading of part of the testimony given by appellee and others prior to January 15, 1975, the six substituted jurors voted on the question of whether or not Levinson committed perjury, among other things, when he testified before the reconstituted grand jury on March 17, 1975. This procedure caused appellee substantial prejudice. The six grand jurors were added as a group in the middle of the investigation. They did not hear appellee’s initial testimony. Furthermore, they heard the evidence in an order and fashion different <em>from </em>the original members, and indeed, did not even hear the same evidence as the rest of the jury because they were read only that testimony which the prosecuting attorney felt was “relevant” to the Fourteenth Presentment. Nevertheless, they were asked to decide whether in so testifying the defendant committed perjury.</p>

      <em>Meckley, McCann, </em>and <em>Philadelphia Grand Jury </em>clearly support the proposition that the supervising court must have authority to take steps reasonably necessary to permit an extended grand jury to complete its work. Criminal activity, particularly where it involves governmental corruption, is often too extensive, and procedural objections too involved, to be dealt with in a period through which all original grand jurors are able to sit. These significant considerations, of great public concern, as well as the fact that fifteen of the original twenty-three investigating grand jurors, a lawful quorum, remained members of the grand jury until its termination, far outweigh appellee’s vague and unsupported assertion of prejudice. Indeed, Judge Takiff’s addition of six new jurors, properly chosen, sworn, and charged, was a reasonable and appropriate measure that in no way increased the likelihood that the original grand jurors would recommend indictment or otherwise injure appellee.</p>

Appellee has challenged the probative value of neither the investigating grand jury’s Presentment nor the additional testimony heard by the indicting grand jury.

Rather, it is an ex <em>parte </em>investigation to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether criminal proceedings should be instituted against any person.” <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 343-44, <a href="/us/414/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="94 S. Ct. 613" data-case-ids="11715874" data-case-paths="/us/414/0338-01">94 S.Ct. at 618</a>. The majority disregards this vital substantive distinction and proceeds to create remedies for rights that have not been injured and to find prejudice where none exists. Ignored also is the admonition of the Supreme Court in <em>Calandra : </em>“When the grand jury is performing its investigatory function into a general problem area . society’s interest is best served by a thorough and extensive investigation.” 414 U.S. at 344, <a href="/us/414/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="94 S.

At this time in our societal and jurisprudential development, when the functions of investigating grand juries probing governmental corruption are so essential to the fair and equal administration of criminal justice, the majority’s intrusion into the grand jury room and its unsupported findings of prejudice serve no public interest and only frustrate the important work grand juries must perform.</p>
