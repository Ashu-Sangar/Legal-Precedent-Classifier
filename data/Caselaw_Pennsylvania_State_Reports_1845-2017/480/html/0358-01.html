Appellant filed its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax return in 1971 pursuant to the Tax Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, Art. I, § 101, as amended, 72 P.S. § 7201 (Supp.1978) indicating a tax liability of $77,745. Appellee, the Commonwealth, in determining appellant’s corporate net income tax, increased the tax to $111,818.34. The Board of Finance and Revenue ordered a resettlement with a taxation figure of $107,976.24. The Commonwealth Court affirmed this resettlement, and appellant exercised its right of appeal to this Court. <em>See </em>The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, § 203, 17 P.S. § 211.203 (Supp.1978).</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.7",492,[246,1236,1156,787]]]'>The controversy in this case is whether the Secretary of Revenue may utilize a method of determining business income taxable by Pennsylvania which excludes appellant’s sales in states in which the appellant is not jurisdictionally subject to corporate taxes. Excluding such sales results in a greater apportionment percentage and thus a greater net income tax liability. The Commonwealth Court found this method to be permissible under Article IV of the Tax Reform Code, 72 P.S. § 7401(3)2(a)(18), when the statutory method of apportioning the taxpayer’s income does not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in Pennsylvania. <em>Hellertown Manufacturing Co. v.

The parties agree that the property fraction equals 100% since all of the appellant’s tangible property is located in Pennsylvania. They further agree that the payroll fraction equals 100% because all of appellant’s employees are also located within the Commonwealth. The dispute concerns the sales fraction.</p>

This rule eliminated from the denominator of the sales fraction. Heller-town’s receipts from sales made in states in which Heller-town was not jurisdictionally subject to corporate taxes. The subtraction of these sales in states which did not have the requisite jurisdiction to impose a tax on net income from the sales fraction denominator mathematically adjusted the sales fraction to approximately 96%. This resulted in a computation by appellee of Hellertown's taxes of $107,976.24 as compared to appellant’s claim of tax liability of $77,-745.00.</p>

The legislature provided that the Secretary of Revenue could vary the method of calculating the sales fraction when the statutory formula did not yield a taxable income “fairly” representative of “the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this State . .” Therefore, appellee may employ the “throw out” rule to recompute the sales fraction only if the 67% apportionment figure sought to be used by appellant is not “fairly” representative of appellant’s “business activity” in Pennsylvania.</p>

Since 100% of appellant’s property and employees are located in Pennsylvania, it is the sales portion which constitutes the out-of-state “business activity.” The theory behind appellant’s argument is that the remainder of its “business activity” occurs in those states in which it sells nearly all of its products. While it is true that appellant has structured itself so that most of its sales occur in states other than Pennsylvania, the reality of the situation is that Hellertown does not pay corporate taxes in any other state (with the exception of Ohio where it paid the minimum franchise tax of $50.00 per year). These other states in which appellant made the bulk of its sales, and to which it now seeks to apportion nearly one-third of its business income, cannot tax appellant unless some local incident (“business activity”) occurred within the state. The United States Supreme Court has held that there must be at least minimal connections between a state and the potential taxpayer selling goods in the state in order to establish a jurisdictional nexus justifying the imposition of a tax. <em>See National Bellas Hess, </em>
