This program was concerned exclusively with homicide cases, and there is no evidence suggesting that the court allowed the parties to bypass cases such as appellant’s in order to resolve easier cases first. See <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/457/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="457 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="477641" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0502-01">457 Pa. 502</a>, 509, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2015" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="327 A.2d 15">327 A,2d 15</a> (1974).

The record shows, however, that this delay was occasioned by the appointment of appellant’s new counsel to the bench and by several continuances requested by counsel subsequently appointed.</p>

Although the criminal justice system was in no hurry to try appellant, it took away his right to counsel of his own choice and then took eight additional months to try appellant. There is no adequate basis in the record for depriving appellant of private counsel of his choice.</p>
