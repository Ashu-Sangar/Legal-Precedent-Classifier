The Association filed with appellant Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practice charge, alleging appellee violated Sections 1201(a)(1) and 1201(a)(5) of the Public Employe Relations Act (Act 195)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by unilaterally terminating the employment of teacher-aides and replacing them with unpaid volunteers. Appellee answered and admitted terminating employment, but contended that its conduct was lawful because it was prompted by economic considerations. After a hearing, the Board found that volunteers <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>were substantially performing the duties of teacher-aides. In its final order, the Board agreed with the Association that appellee’s unilateral conduct constituted a refusal to bargain with the Association, in violation of Sections 1201(a)(1) and 1201(a)(5). The Court of Common Pleas of Butler County reversed the final order of the Board. The Board then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed. We granted the Board’s petition for allowance of appeal and now reverse the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the final order of the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

While the contract did not specifically guarantee work for any employee, it can only be read to embody a tacit understanding by both parties that the positions which the agreement recognized would, in fact, continue. Indeed, the contract language, while sparse, suggests that it was intended as an extension of the practice with respect to the paid teacher aides program which had obtained in the preceding year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> No support for the School District’s action can be found in the management rights provision which is silent on any anticipated changes in the use of paraprofessional personnel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> In such a situation, it is entirely reasonable to conclude <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>that the security of these positions falls within the language of Section 701 as a bargainable item.

In striking a balance between the values sought to be conserved by Sections 701 and 702, respectively, of the Act it is necessary, as the opinions in <em>State </em>College<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> made clear, to gauge the impact of an issue on the respective interests of employees and employer. In that case I ventured to express the “impact test” for striking a balance between those two sections in terms which differed somewhat from those used in the majority opinion. I suggested that “the factors to be balanced in determining the susceptibility of an item to collective bargaining are the probable effects of the granting or refusal of the item upon (a) the individual performance by the teachers of their duties as such, and upon (b) the <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>school board’s overall operation of an educational system within its district.” I further stated that “[i]f the effect of the granting or denial of a request [for bargaining] would be more direct, immediate and substantial upon the teachers’ individual performance of their duties than it would be upon the school board’s overall operation of an educational system, the item should be considered negotiable.” <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">461 Pa. at 515</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">337 A.2d at 272</a> (concurring opinion of Pomeroy, J.).

Whichever formulation be utilized in the case at bar, I am satisfied that the termination of the paid teacher aides, with a resultant savings to the School District of $25,000, or less than one percent of its overall budget, did not affect the “functions and programs”, <em>see </em>Sec. 702 of the Act, of this particular public employer so as to remove the item from the duty to bargain under Section 701; nor was the determination whether the program could or should be continued, with or without modification, of any major significance to the overall operation of the Mars Area School system in ways other than financial. The termination of the aide positions did, however, have an immediate, direct and drastically adverse effect on the employees involved. I agree, therefore, that the employer’s action in terminating the employment of the complainants unilaterally, without bargaining, was in violation of the Act.</p>

    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[237,951,1154,574]]]'>It is important to note that the School District’s utilization of a volunteer aide program predates the present controversy, having been begun in late 1967 or early 1968. At that time, volunteer aides were assigned to specific teachers. The aides performed tutorial and clerical work under the teachers’ supervision, but performed no supervisory functions themselves. During the 1971-72 school year, there were approximately seventy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> such aides working in the School District on a purely voluntary basis. The volunteers chose their own work schedules and were free to quit any time without notice.</p>
    <p id="b440-7" data-blocks='[["BL_440.7",440,[236,1559,1155,743]],["BL_441.1",441,[243,305,1152,88]]]'>The inception of the paid teacher aide program came about not long before the negotiation of the instant agreement. In 1971 a few persons who formerly worked as part-time cafeteria supervisors were hired as full-time employees and redesignated as teacher aides. Their numbers were increased, the scope of their duties enlarged and the length of the work day extended to seven and one-half hours. As previously stated, in the 1971-72 school year there were eleven paid teacher aides working in the School District. Their supervisory duties consisted of monitoring students on the playground, in the cafeteria, in study hall, in the hallways of the schools, in the libraries, in the busloading areas and during auditorium programs. In addition, the aides performed general clerical work for the professional <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>staff and assisted teachers with tutorial and housekeeping duties in the classrooms.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[241,421,1153,1061]]]'>Following termination of the eleven teacher aide positions there was no “engaging of volunteer aides” to do the work of the paid aides, as the Board erroneously found. Rather, the school district simply continued in effect its five year old policy of using volunteer aides. Thus the record shows that after the complainants were discharged, (1) the volunteer aides continued to do what they had done previously, some of which overlapped with what the paid teacher aides did; (2) some of the tasks performed by the paid teacher aides were taken over by the teachers in accordance with the practice in the School District before the paid teacher aides were hired; and (3) if the tasks of the paid teacher aides were not absorbed by volunteer aides or teachers already on the staff, they were not performed at all. In light of these undisputed facts, it is quite inaccurate to declare, as the Court does, that “volunteers substantially replaced teacher-aides,” Opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 303, or to suggest that the degree of utilization of volunteers that continued after the discharge of the paid aides was an interference, restraint or coercion of the paid aides in the exercise of their rights.</p>

But that refusal, all are agreed, is a violation of Sec. 1201(a)(5), “[rjefusing to bargain collectively in good faith”. Nothing in the PERA suggests or warrants the conclusion that this failure, without more, is to be deemed also a violation of the entirely separate first clause of § 1201(a), “interfering, restraining or coercing employes.” The Court’s sole basis for such a tour de force is three totally inapposite federal cases relative to the National Labor Relations Act, <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>which the Court transports into our interpretative case law pertaining to Pennsylvania’s PERA. But as the Court has said in <em>State College, supra, </em>our leading case dealing with the problems which inhere in Sections 701 and 702 of the Act, while federal decisions may provide some guidance in view of the linguistic similarities between parts of the NLRA and PERA, “it does not necessarily follow that federal precedent relating to private employment is particularly helpful in resolving difficulties in the public sector.” <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">461 Pa. at 499</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">337 A.2d at 264</a>. <em>See also, Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.

A finding of a violation of Section 1201(a)(1) necessarily requires a finding of interference with or restraint or coercion of employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by Section 401 of PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.401. That section is the “employe rights” provision of the statute, and provides as follows:</p>
