On October 10, 1975, appellant, while driving his own automobile, encountered an automobile driven by Robert Stephens, the victim, at a particularly narrow passage of Ebensburg Road in the city of Johnstown. As both cars arrived at the spot simultaneously, neither was able to pass. Following a verbal exchange, appellant backed his car into a side street and allowed Stephens to pass.</p>

Thus, if Pa.R.A.P. 1923 does not provide all the relief the constitution grants, an appellant asserting this constitutional right need neither invoke the Rule nor allege any failure to comply with it. Cf. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">373 U.S. 83</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">83 S.Ct. 1194</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">10 L.Ed.2d 215</a> (1963) (defendant has constitutional right to exculpatory material in possession of prosecution, regardless of restrictions created by rules of procedure). Appellant, however, has not asserted any violation of his constitutional right to a transcript of the proceedings. I therefore concur in the result.</p>

The majority, however, upholds the trial court’s refusal to allow the opinion in this case on the ground that the witness was “equivocal” when he testified to the facts upon which he <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>was prepared to give his opinion. There was nothing equivocal about the facts to which the witness testified. Equivocal means indeterminate, ambiguous, inconclusive, ambivalent, obscure and other things all indicating fuzziness.

    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[219,1015,1158,625]]]'>The majority opinion turns its back on well-settled law in probably all American jurisdictions that only a <em>minimal </em>foundation of underlying facts need be presented before a witness is allowed to give an opinion when the opinion concerns the corporal appearances of persons or things. Wigmore points out that a witness should not be prohibited from giving a “compendious description” when the corporal appearances of persons or things are at issue. He specifically refers to opinions concerning a person who looks ill, sad, old, or <em>intoxicated. </em>In speaking of courts that prohibit compendious descriptions of corporal appearances, including intoxication, Wigmore states:</p>

    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[277,537,1156,898]]]'>There are certain opinions which are almost factual in nature and involve the type of opinion which the layman automatically formulates accurately even though articulation of the underlying descriptive facts is difficult. In these areas the law has consistently permitted the compendious description. The witness in this case <em>was able </em>to give specific underlying descriptive facts. Even without such specificity, an opinion as to intoxication should be permitted. <em>Commonwealth v. Eyler, </em><a href="/pa/217/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="217 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="953705" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0512-01">217 Pa. 512</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20746" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="66 A. 746">66 A. 746</a> (1907); <em>Commonwealth v.

The validity of the intoxication opinion can, of course, be challenged through cross-examination concerning the underlying fact upon which the opinion is based. The trial court’s refusal in this case to allow the witness to give an intoxication opinion, and this Court’s affirmance of that refusal, demonstrate the absurdity of which Professor Wigmore speaks.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[276,1455,1154,790]]]'>I must also dissent from the majority’s conclusion that appellant is foreclosed from assigning as error the trial court’s noncompliance with Rule 1923 in its attempt to supply the missing portions of the transcript. The majority so holds because the Rule was in effect for six weeks at the time of the hearing and appellant did not specifically object on the ground that the trial court’s procedure violated the Rule. This is absurd. Appellant objected <em>generally </em>and moved for a mistrial. Our Rules of Appellate Procedure are directives to the <em>bench </em>as well as the bar. The trial court made absolutely no effort to determine whether its proposal for supplying the missing transcript complied with the Rule; it simply overruled appellant’s objection and proceeded with its proposed procedure. Yet the majority holds that appellant cannot now complain of the trial court’s noncompliance.</p>

The procedure clearly did not comport with the Rule and appellant was denied due process of law when his objection to the trial court’s procedure was overruled.</p>
