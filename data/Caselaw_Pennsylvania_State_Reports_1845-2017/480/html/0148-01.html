The PERA was enacted to accord public employes the right to organize and bargain with their employers, 43 P.S. § 1101.101.

It was not the purpose of § 1101.301(13)(ii) to exclude every employe even remotely “associated with” collective bargaining, from the janitorial employes who clean up after negotiation sessions to the employes who keep the negotiators supplied with coffee, drinking water and sharpened pencils. To the contrary, when we consider the purpose of the PERA, it becomes clear that the section is far more amenable to the <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>interpretation given it by the Board — limiting the exclusion to those employers who work in a close continual relationship with managerial employes who actually formulate, determine or effectuate the employer’s labor policy.</p>

If the NLRB definition was somehow in derogation of the PERA definition of confidential employe, there might be merit to the School District’s argument, for under those circumstances we would look askance at the Board’s reliance on federal experience. In excluding confidential employes from bargaining units, however, the considerations underlying the federal rule for the private sector and the PERA definition for the public sector are identical. In such a case, we have acknowledged the relevance of federal precedent as helpful in resolving questions under the PERA. <em>Costigan v. Philadelphia Finance Dept.

The Board found that the principals for whom the secretaries worked were not part of the school district’s bargaining team. Testimony adduced at the hearing revealed that the principals were, on infrequent occasions, consulted as to the effect a certain contract provision would have on them as principals. This tenuous association with the collective bargaining process is hardly the “formulation, determination, or effectuation of labor policy” envisaged by the Board’s definition of a confidential employe. We agree with the Board that the drafters of the PERA did not intend to deny the benefits of public employe <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>status to every employe however tangentially connected to collective bargaining negotiations. One secretary to a junior high school principal, whom the parties agree had a relationship to the principal typical of all four secretaries, testified that in ten years employment with the school district she typed materials relative to collective bargaining on only two occasions. Both were one or two page memoranda. We agree with the Board that to deny these secretaries the salutary effects of public employe status based on such a minimal connection with collective bargaining would distort the legislative intent to accord employes in the public sector the right to organize and have the benefit of union representation. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1101.101 (statement of policy).</p>

We do not agree. The Board properly concluded that the handling of grievances is not part of the “formulation, determination, or effectuation” of an employer’s labor policy. The only possible connection these secretaries might have had with the handling of grievances would be the typing of correspondence in regard to the grievance process. The NLRB experience is again helpful. It has consistently held that the typing of materials relating to grievances is not sufficient to render an employe confidential, on the rationale that working with a person who handles grievances is not working with someone who is responsible for the formulation or effectuation of management’s labor relations policy. <em>ITT Grinnell Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=212%20NLRB%20No.%20105" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="212 NLRB No. 105">212 NLRB No. 105</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20L.R.R.M.%20%28BNA%29%201404" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="87 L.R.R.M.

Words in a statute must be interpreted not in a vacuum but by resort to the considerations which gave rise to the statute’s enactment. In light of the policy underlying § 1101.301(13), it would make no sense to deny this payroll clerk public employe status on the ground she was a confidential employe if the only information to which she had access was readily available to the employe association. An employe not privy to anything confidential should not be deemed a “confidential employe” based on an interpretation of the statute divorced from the purpose or policy underpinning the statute.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[151,1055,1155,455]]]'>The NLRB, with years of experience in determining the status of employes who have access to personnel records, also requires that the information to which the employe has access be confidential. The NLRB has expressly rejected the argument that access to personnel files, unless it involves access to confidential information, excludes an employe from the bargaining unit. <em>Taft Broadcasting Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=226%20NLRB%20No.%2087" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="226 NLRB No. 87">226 NLRB No. 87</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20L.R.R.M.%20%28BNA%29%201089" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="94 L.R.R.M.

    <blockquote id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[191,1797,1110,250]]]'>“That the School District employs a payroll clerk who maintains an office in the Employer’s central personnel office who prepares the payroll and has access to information used by the public employer in the collective bargaining process.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>In spite of our agreement with the Board that an employe must have access to confidential information in order to qualify as a confidential employe, the findings by the Board are not adequate to decide whether the payroll clerk falls within the confidential employe exception. The Board found that “the bulk” of the information to which the payroll clerk had access was also available to the public. That finding is far too imprecise for us to determine the legal status of the payroll clerk. The record is likewise of little help in determining to what extent, if any, the payroll clerk had access to confidential information, for the issue of the public availability or nonavailability of the information to which the payroll clerk had access was neither directly addressed nor adequately explored at the Board hearing. Under these circumstances, the matter must be remanded to the Board for consideration, consistent with this opinion, of the status of the payroll clerk.</p>
