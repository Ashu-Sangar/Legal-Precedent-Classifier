The test to be applied in reviewing the conviction of first degree murder is whether, viewing all of the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the verdict winner, and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, there is sufficient evidence to enable the trier of fact to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

The console and armrest of the vehicle were stained with blood, but it was not possible to determine the blood type. Search of appellant’s residence produced two brown gloves stained with blood; again no blood typing was possible. The search of the residence also revealed a white glove <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>which was stained with group B blood.

In the present case, the conduct of the Philadelphia and Bucks County police was reasonable. Appellant was arrested and, shortly thereafter, the car which was used in the commission of the crime according to the eyewitness was located on a public street. Appellant’s alleged co-conspirator (the younger boy seen with appellant at the parking lot near the store) was still at large and his family and girlfriend lived in the vicinity in which the Volkswagen was found. Thus, the car could easily have been removed from the area and its evidence lost. And, no search of the car’s interior was made until a search warrant had been obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate upon a showing of probable cause.

Mr. La Hoda presented an application to suppress all of the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrants issued in the case, including the evidence located in the Volkswagen. At the suppression hearing, appellant expressed dissatisfaction with the public defender and indicated that he desired a continuance to give him an opportunity to retain private counsel. Mr. La Hoda also advised the court he knew that “Mr. Holzer has mistrusted me from the beginning and that he has had a preference of having other counsel”.

    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[177,355,1156,1190]]]'>The majority has determined that in spite of the lower court error in denying appellant’s request for a continuance in order to allow him an opportunity to retain private counsel of his own choice, appellant is not entitled to relief. The majority found that appellant’s attempt to exercise his constitutional right to counsel of his choice was timely and was not a dilatory tactic. Thus it was concluded that appellant’s right to select counsel of his choice had indeed been violated. In view of this holding, I cannot accept the majority’s subsequent conclusion that the denial of appellant’s right to counsel was harmless error. Implicitly the majority reasons that because the counsel who actually represented appellant performed competently, the denial of appellant’s right to counsel of his choice could not have contributed to the verdict and, therefore, was harmless error. <em>See Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, 409, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a>, 164 (1978). In my view, such reasoning rests upon a purely speculative comparison between actual counsel’s performance and the majority’s conjecture as to how an attorney chosen by appellant might have proceeded in handling appellant’s case. More importantly, such an application of the harmless error doctrine would render nugatory the right to counsel of one’s choice. I therefore dissent.</p>
