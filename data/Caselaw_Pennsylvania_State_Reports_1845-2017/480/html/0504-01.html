We conclude that they do possess such qualities. The photographs are eight by ten inch black and white glossy pictures. Each print shows a close-up view of the victim’s body at the scene of the murder, the victim’s mobile home. The victim is clothed in what appears to be undergarments, and his body and clothing are splattered with blood.

As the Commonwealth correctly notes, this Court in <em>Powell </em>reversed a judgment of sentence because the trial judge admitted into evidence a series of color slides of the murder victim’s body. The Commonwealth proceeds to argue that because the photographs in the instant case were in black and white, <em>Powell </em>is inapplicable. While it is true that color photographs have the tendency of highlighting the gory details depicted, <em>see Commonwealth v.

Nor has our independent review of the record disclosed any issue as to which the photographs would be essential. The Commonwealth proceeded upon the theory of felony murder, charging robbery as the underlying felony. At trial, the coroner, who examined the victim’s body at the crime scene, testified extensively as to the condition of the victim’s body and the nature of the wounds. Following the coroner’s testimony, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy testified as to similar matters and stated that death was caused by knife and bullet wounds. Thus, there was an abundance of expert testimony going to prove the element of death due to a criminal agency. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">476 Pa. 557</a>, 563-566, <a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">383 A.2d 503</a>, 506-08 (1978). There is no indication that the photographs were necessary to supplement the otherwise specific testimony of the coroner and the pathologist. This Court’s statement in <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, supra, </em>is equally applicable here:</p>
    <blockquote id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[262,1336,1111,577]]]'>Here, we have a clear felony murder case where the force used and the nature and extent of the injuries involved have no bearing on a finding of first degree felony murder. Moreover, assuming their relevance with respect to appellant’s intent to commit grievous bodily harm, nowhere is it illustrated to our satisfaction that the pathologist could not have adequately and effectively testified without the use of these photographs. Whatever aid these photographs may have been, their use was clearly outweighed by the emotional impact it would undoubtedly have on the jury. (Footnote omitted)</blockquote>

See <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the correct standard to be applied “involves weighing the necessarily inflammatory nature of this evidence against its ‘essential evidentiary value.’ ” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[243,1072,1154,707]]]'>Applying the <em>Powell </em>balancing test to the facts of this case, I conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion by admitting these photographs. The extent of the injuries is of no bearing on a finding of felony murder. Moreover, the coroner who examined the body at the scene of the crime and the pathologist who conducted the autopsy testified extensively as to the condition of the victim’s body and the nature of the wounds. Whatever evidentiary value the photographs may have would be merely cumulative to the medical testimony. That minimal value is clearly outweighed here by the inflammatory nature of the evidence and the prejudicial impact it would necessarily have on the jury.</p>

First, as I have previously stated, I believe that photographs depicting the lifeless body of the victim, of a crime are <em>per se </em>inflammatory and likely to so affect the jury that they should be admitted into evidence only if they are of essential evidentiary value. Clearly, the photographs at issue here were not essential and their admission was reversible error.</p>
