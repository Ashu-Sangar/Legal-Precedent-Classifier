Razumic and Mowry invested more than $5,000 of borrowed funds in inventory, equipment, and working capital. Arco financed their first supply of gasoline and the pair opened for business.</p>

Over the years, Razumic and Arco signed numerous writings, all of which resembled the first form. The parties also signed additional form writings prepared by Arco concerning such matters as purchase of fuel from Arco and check cashing privileges for Arco credit card customers. Razumic participated in many of Arco’s promotional campaigns, and one year was named one of the top ten Arco retailers in the Pittsburgh area. An Arco marketing representative characterized Razumic as an “excellent dealer.”</p>

That August, Razumic and Arco signed another “DEALER LEASE,” again prepared by Arco, containing many of the same printed provisions as the previous forms. The 1970 writing also contained a typed provision for a three year term of occupancy. The parties signed a separate form authorizing Razumic to use Arco’s property to the rear of the service station for parking rental vehicles which the Hertz Corporation authorized Razumic to rent to the public. The latter form contained a typed provision authorizing either party to terminate the Hertz parking lot agreement upon thirty days’ notice, “with or without cause.”</p>

On July 31, Arco likewise notified Razumic that the Hertz parking lot lease would not be renewed and gave him one month to vacate the premises. When Razumic refused to vacate the station property, Arco discontinued his supply of gasoline and filed a Landlord and Tenant Complaint with the District Justice for Monroeville. The District Justice entered judgment for Arco, directing Razumic to deliver the station premises to Arco and awarded Arco damages for Razumic’s detention of the premises beyond the expiration date set forth in the form “DEALER LEASE.” Razumic appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, filed a bond, and obtained a supersede-as.</p>

The instrument sets the “term” of the “lease” at three years, requires “lessee” to pay taxes and various utilities and “maintain and keep in good order the leased premises.” The printed form provides that “lessee’s” right of possession shall not extend “beyond the period of LESSOR’S right thereto.” The form also recites that “[t]his lease contains the entire agreement of the parties and its execution has not been induced by any representation, understanding, or agreement of any kind other than those herein expressed” and “cannot be amended except by written instrument duly executed by both parties.” Nothing in the writing sets forth the parties’ rights and obligations concerning renewal of the agreement. Arco contends the above provisions, coupled with the absence of an express provision governing renewal, demonstrate that the parties contemplated a landlord and tenant relationship, terminable by either party upon expiration of the term of occupancy.

An examination of all the provisions of the writing signed by Razumic and Arco reveals that the parties contemplated an agreement imposing obligations, and conferring rights, beyond those of a lessor-lessee agreement. The writing authorizes Razumic to operate an “Atlantic Richfield Service Station.” The instrument further provides:</p>

The writing fixes rent on the basis of total gallons of fuel sold per month, using “LESSOR’S then current FRANCHISE RENT SCHEDULE.” The writing requires Razumic to submit a “certified, itemized statement showing all information necessary for the proper calculation of the rental” and authorizes Arco to audit “at all reasonable times” Razumic’s books and records concerning sale of fuel. The writing prohibits “absentee operation” and “subletting” and does not allow Razumic to “make any additions, alterations, or improvement to the leased premises nor place, alter, remove, deface, or obliterate any signs, trademarks or color arrangements appearing thereon” without first obtaining Arco’s consent. The writing also contemplates Razumic’s retail sale of fuel <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>to Arco credit customers. Arco in return agreed to accept Razumic’s assignment of these accounts. Arco “reserves the right to enter the premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of ascertaining LESSEE’S compliance with the agreements [therein] contained and for making necessary repairs and replacements.”</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[266,632,1156,1131]]]'>Standardized “riders” accompanying the “DEALER LEASE” further spell out the nature of Razumic’s and Arco’s business relationship. One rider allows Arco to enter the premises “in its exclusive judgment, to establish a change in its trade name or other business identification and in the trademark of trade name designations of its products, including, but not limited to, painting of the service station improvements, equipment and facilities, or any part or portion thereof, and installation or replacement of signs and signboards.” Another rider sets forth Razumic’s agreement to “operate the Service Station in such a manner as to reflect favorably on ATLANTIC’S goodwill, trademarks and trade names and take no action that will tend to discredit ATLANTIC in any way,” operate the service station twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, maintain inventory sufficient to fulfill customer needs, arrange and display inventory, advertisements, and sales promotions in a “lawful, orderly and attractive manner,” illuminate the station in the evening and early morning hours and other times “as required for safety and to attract the motoring public,” and “maintain adequate and efficient attendants to properly serve LESSEE’S customers during all hours of operation.”</p>

All this uncontradicted evidence of performance demonstrates Arco’s control over the quality of products and services Razumic offered to the public.

The purpose of the offers, presumably, was to establish that Arco should be estopped from arbitrarily refusing to renew the agreement. The record is equally uninformative as to whether the term of three years was a reasonable period within which the franchisee could obtain a fair return on his investment and his efforts on <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>behalf of Arco with respect to the newly constructed station.

Furthermore, it should be observed that regardless of the wisdom of the Act of November 26, 1975, P.L. 454, §§ 1 <em>et seq., </em>73 P.S. §§ 202-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1978) which as noted by the majority now governs the cancellation and renewal of such franchise agreements, the Act has no applicability whatsoever to the instant case which arose prior to the Act’s effective date. Indeed, if any conclusion were to be drawn from the passage of this legislation it would be that the General Assembly was seeking to alter a previously legitimate practice.</p>
