The crime — the rape and other sexual molestation of an elderly woman — was itself shocking.

We disagree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> First, that question was framed in terms of “dealings or experiences.” Even assuming that the question was specific enough to discover prejudice, it would not be apt to reach persons who are perhaps most susceptible to stereotypic views, viz., persons who have had little or no dealing with black persons.

See <em>Commonwealth v.

To an extent we agree. Question (4) (“Do you feel that anyone so evidencing affection would be more likely to commit a crime than anyone else?”) was too suggestive of the ultimate facts to be established at trial and accordingly was properly refused. Likewise, question (3) contained material irrelevant to the issue of possible juror prejudice. Thus we believe that the first sentence of that question (“There may be some evidence in this case that early on the night when this murder was committed the defendant, who is black, evidenced affection for a white girl”) unnecessarily referred to specific facts and should have been stricken. Nevertheless, it does not follow that the legitimate need to explore specific and relevant prejudices, having been brought to the attention of the court, should have been stricken in toto simply because the question, as framed, contained superfluous matter. The purpose of voir dire is to secure a “competent, fair, impartial and unprejudicial jury.” <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em>469 Pa. at 426, 366 A.2d at 248. That responsibility must be shared by the trial court and respective counsel in the interests of vindicating the public interest in assuring a fair trial. The proper response to such a legitimate concern, even though the question itself might be <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>improperly constructed, is to fashion a permissible inquiry so that the possible prejudice or bias may be exposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

While most jurisdictions recognize the right to examine prospective jurors with respect to their qualifications, there remains considerable disagreement as to how the voir dire itself should be carried out. It has been argued that voir dire examination by counsel is a constitutional right. <em>See </em>Gutman, The Attorney-Conducted Voir Dire of Jurors: A Constitutional Right, 39 Brooklyn L.Rev. 290 (1972).

In fact, the prosecution’s own expert witnesses gave evidence tending to establish that appellant was <em>not </em>at either location. For example, a police detective testified that the vegetation on the path leading from the victim’s house to the location where the body was found was so thick that he had trouble going through it in daylight without tearing his uniform. Although the perpetrator of this crime had violently assaulted the decedent, and dragged her struggling body from her home over severe and dangerous terrain without the benefit of light, the prosecution’s own witnesses testified that when appellant was examined by police on July 9, the day the murder had been committed, he was found to be completely free of any cuts, bruises, bites, scratches or any visible signs that he might have participated in this crime. Furthermore, the clothing that appellant wore at the party on the evening of July 8, and which was found by the police in appellant’s bathroom, was thoroughly examined by the representatives of the crime lab and no damage to the garments was noted. In addition, trace evidence was found at the scene of the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>crime which strongly indicated that someone else had perpetrated the crime. Prosecution witnesses testified that two palm prints were found on the metal arms of a folding summer chair placed near the window which had been broken to permit the murderer to enter the Mattes’ house. These prints were not placed by an individual sitting in the chair, but by someone facing the chair, as if the chair was lifted and used to break the window. The prints were not those of appellant or the victim. A red fiber was removed from a figurine on the nightstand in Mrs. Mattes’ room. This fiber did not match any of the Mattes’ clothing, nor did it match the appellant’s clothing. The police crime lab also determined, after careful scientific analysis, that samples of mud taken from appellant’s shoes and boots did not match samples of mud taken from the murder scene, and that the material obtained from the drain of the tub where appellant’s clothes had been washed did not match any material or dirt obtained by the crime lab from the murder scene. Samples of mud taken from the steps and front porch of the Mattes’ home, however, were similar to that collected from the murder scene.</p>

(The prisoner who testified that he overheard the statement referred to above and in the majority opinion has since recanted that testimony and said that no such statement was ever made in his presence.)
