In the instant case, Azzarello’s right hand was pinched between two hard rubber rolls in a coating machine manufactured and sold by the defendant, Black Brothers, Inc. Azzarello brought this suit against Black Brothers Company, Inc., the manufacturer-appellant relying solely on <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>the theory of strict liability under Section 402A of the Restatement Second of Torts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The manufacturer, by joining appellee’s employer, Parts Processing, as an additional defendant, injected into appellee’s strict liability case the issue of whether the negligence of the employer was the sole or contributing cause of her injuries. Accordingly, the trial court below was faced with the difficult problem of devising instructions for the jury which required a clear exposition of the law of strict liability upon which appellee exclusively relied, and also explaining with clarity the interrelationship of the more traditional and familiar jury instructions sounding in fault and negligence, necessitated by manufacturer-appellant’s theory of the case. In so doing, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury using the phrase “unreasonably dangerous” taken verbatim from the formulation provided by Restatement Second of Torts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It cannot, of course, be asserted that a federal district court’s opinion as to the constitutional validity of a foreign statute is a binding precedent, but the case was sufficiently relevant to the proper resolution of the matter at issue that the lower court was commended in our per curiam affirmance for its attempt to insure the just and comprehensive resolution of the case. <em>In Estate of Riley, supra. </em>In the instant case, appellee’s counsel made timely request for a new trial based on the subsequent decision of this Court in <em>Berkebile, <a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">supra,</a> </em>which the court <em>en banc </em>granted to insure a just and comprehensive resolution of the case. This view does not undercut the rationale articulated by this Court in our decision in <em>Dilliplaine v.

An earlier objection to the “unreasonably dangerous” language would have been unavailing at the time of the trial because the instruction as given tracked the language of Section 402A of the Restatement.

The realities of our economic society as it exists today forces the conclusion that the risk of loss for injury resulting from defective products should be borne by the suppliers, principally because they are in a position to absorb the loss by distributing it as a cost of doing business. In an era of giant corporate structures, utilizing the national media to sell their wares, the original concern for an emerging manufacturing industry has given way to the view that it is now the consumer who must be protected. Courts have increasingly adopted the position that the risk of loss must be placed upon the supplier of the defective product without regard to fault or privity of contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

This analysis is most helpful and can be used with profit by trial and appellate judges, and by students and commentators. But it is not ordinarily given to the jury. Instead, they are told that negligence depends upon what a reasonable prudent man would do under the same or similar circumstances.

Should an ill-conceived design which exposes the user to the risk of harm entitle one injured by the product to recover? Should adequate warnings of the dangerous propensities of an article insulate one who suffers injuries from those propensities? When does the utility of a product outweigh the unavoidable danger it may pose? These are questions of law and their resolution depends upon social policy. Restated, the phrases “defective condition” and “unreasonably dangerous” as used in the Restatement formulation are terms of art invoked when <em>strict liability </em>is appropriate. It is a judicial function to decide whether, under plaintiff’s averment of the facts, recovery would be justified; and only after this judicial determination is made is the cause submitted to the jury to determine whether the facts of the case support the averments of the complaint. They do not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute which is properly assigned to the jury for resolution.

This is the way in which it was first published in a form open to the public and in which it first came to the Institute floor. When the issue was raised on the floor, Dean Prosser explained that the Council was worried about liability for a product like whiskey, so that a ‘man <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>who consumes it and gets delirium tremens’ might recover because a jury ‘might find that all whiskey is unreasonably dangerous to the consumer.’ The word ‘defective’ was added to ensure that it was understood that something had to be wrong with the product. The addition of the word ‘defective’ was attacked on the floor of the Institute by Reed Dickerson, on the ground that the expression ‘unreasonably dangerous’ was sufficient. Dean Prosser responded with an explanation of the action of the Council and the statement that he had been indifferent to the change. Mr. Dickerson was supported by Dean Lockhart and Professor Joiner, but the Institute, tired after what had been a lengthy discussion of the section, decided by an uncounted voice vote not to make a change. It may be significant that ‘defective condition’ was defined in the comments in terms of being unreasonably dangerous, so that the terms came close to being synonymous, one explaining the meaning of the other. Finally, it should be noted that the decision had been made while the section applied only to foods (so that ‘defective’ was essentially the same as unwholesome), and that when the section was later broadened to include all products no reference was made again to this issue. Bad designs and lack of warning are of less significance in regard to food than they are in regard to many other products.” (footnotes omitted)</blockquote>
