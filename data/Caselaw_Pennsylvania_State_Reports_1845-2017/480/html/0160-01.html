Post-trial motions were denied and Wade was thereafter sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five to ten years. This direct appeal followed,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which appellant raises several trial errors deemed to require a new trial. For the reasons stated hereafter, we believe these arguments are without merit. On the record before us, however, we are unable to resolve appellant’s further charge that he was denied his constitutional right to effective representation by a lawyer at trial. Accordingly, we will remand the case to the trial court for the holding of an evidentiary hearing on this aspect of the case.</p>

      <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>Appellant’s conviction stems from the death of a two-year old child, David Strong. David was the victim of abusive treatment by Wade and the child’s mother, Regina Strong, with whom Wade lived. The Commonwealth’s case against Wade depended primarily on the testimony of Strong. She testified that shortly after she and her three children moved into Wade’s home, the couple, at Wade’s suggestion, began to “discipline” David by use of a restraining leash and a horse whip. Medical testimony and photographs introduced at trial indicated extensive markings over the child’s body as a result of this punishment. The cause of death, according to the Commonwealth’s medical testimony, was an intestinal rupture, the result of a blunt force injury. Ms. Strong testified that shortly before the child’s death appellant had “stomped” on David’s stomach with his bare foot. Taking the stand in his own behalf, Wade denied this charge. Cross-examination by his lawyer of prosecution witnesses suggested that the cause of death was a fall sustained by David on the day of his death, and Wade testified that Regina Strong, the child’s mother, had told him of such a fall. Wade also testified that it was Strong who assumed responsibility for the disciplining of the children, including David. The jury chose to believe the Commonwealth’s version of the death and returned a verdict of guilty.</p>

We note, however, that defense counsel’s objection to the question was sustained and therefore the jury never was told whether a suit in divorce had been brought or what the basis of the action might have been. Moreover, a cautionary instruction was immediately given to the jury to ignore the question. The action of the trial court was, if anything, overly favorable to the defense, since on direct examination <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>of Wade his lawyer had probed into Wade’s marital status and thus opened the door to the cross-examination.</p>

Thornton testified that prior to trial appellant had confided to him an intention to fabricate testimony regarding the victim’s fall from a fence shortly before his death. Wade argues that since the possibility of such an accident was first elicited during the cross-examination of a prosecution witness, Regina Strong, it may not properly be characterized as part of the defendant’s case and hence rebuttal testimony should not have been admitted. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hickman, </em><a href="/pa/453/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="453 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="577561" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0427-01">453 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20564" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="309 A.2d 564">309 A.2d 564</a> (1973). Wade, however, did testify that Regina Strong had told him that David suffered a fall from the fence. Additionally, Wade’s lawyer cross-examined the Commonwealth’s medical expert concerning the possibility that the victim’s injuries were consistent with such a fall and introduced into evidence two pictures of the fence. It is clear that the defense was attempting to establish an alternative theory as to the cause of death and we find no abuse of discretion in allowing rebuttal testimony as to the possible source of that theory. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Tervalon, </em><a href="/pa/463/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="463 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="1707964" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0581-01">463 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="463 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="1707964" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0581-01">345 A.2d 671</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v.

It is argued that the pictures were inflammatory and prejudicial. In determining the admissibility of such evidence a trial judge should first determine whether the photographs are inflammatory; if they are found not to be, the admissibility of the pictures is to be governed by the normal considerations of relevancy. If the trial judge finds that the proffered pictures are of an inflammatory nature, the inquiry must then proceed to determining whether their evidentiary value outweighs the likelihood that they might prejudice the jury. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In the case at bar, the challenged photographs portrayed various parts of the decedent’s body illustrating the nature and extent of the bruises and contusions, markings which would not have been readily detectable in a black and white picture. There was no blood or distortion of facial features, which were depicted in only one snapshot. Our examination of the pictures leads us to conclude that the trial court acted properly within its discretion in not finding the pictures inflammatory. Even were we to go on to the second phase of the admissibility test (assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the pictures were inflammatory) it is manifest that their relevance outweighed any possibility of prejudice. The photographs were necessary to show not only the extent of the beatings, but also, and of more importance, to illustrate that the bodily markings were consistent with the Commonwealth’s theory that a horse whip and restraining leash were used to inflict them. Evidence of this sort was particularly pertinent in light of the defense theory that the injuries suffered by the victim might have been the result of a fall.</p>

The picture is one of the most inflammatory pictures I have observed since sitting on this Court. Yet, the majority says the picture is not inflammatory.

For this reason the law for many years would not, except in the clearest of cases, deem a picture noninflammatory when the picture depicted a dead person and that fact could be determined from the picture itself.

In doing so, it allows unfair emotional waves to cast doubt on the rational process by which our system of justice is to prove a man guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
