In discharging its responsibility, the Board has confronted a wide range of “refusals to bargain in good faith.” It has held that a public employer refuses to bargain where it refuses to furnish an employee representative records and information reasonably necessary to allow intelligent collective bargaining. <em>Community Mental Health Center of Beaver Co., </em>8 PPER 114. Public employers unilaterally instituting any one of a wide range of changes in working conditions refuse to bargain. E.g., <em>Borough of Berwick, </em>3 PPER 183 (unilateral discontinuance of public employees’ Christmas bonus); <em>Highland Sewer &amp; Water Auth., </em>4 PPER 116 (unilateral increase in wages during negotiations).

By contrast, appellánts here attack the agreement, in which they perceive an illegal shift in responsibility for educational policymaking. They are not asking for an investigation of alleged unfair bargaining tactics. Indeed, nothing in the record demonstrates that appellees refused to bargain fairly and in good faith. The Board's expertise in analyzing bargaining tactics and settling labor disputes therefore cannot contribute to resolution of the substantive validity of appellees’ agreement. Nothing in Act 195 indicates that the Legislature wished the Board, in the first instance, to pass upon this kind of complaint. A contrary interpretation of Act 195 would read “refusing to bargain” out of sections 1201(a)(5) and 1201(b)(3) and distort the commonly understood meaning of “good faith.” We therefore conclude that appellants properly took their complaint to a court of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
