It is true that in the <em>Salvation Army </em>case, the young women residents had limited incomes. Some even had no income at all. And as the Court noted in that case, “In many instances girls have been given free accommodations during periods of financial difficulties and no effort is made to require them to pay for such when they have regained their ability to pay.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20758" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="80 A.2d 758">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/367/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="367 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1228366" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0373-01">367 Pa. at 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20758" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="80 A.2d 758">80 A.2d at 760</a>. This situation is in stark contrast to the practice in the Lemington Heights project, where families cannot even be approved as tenants unless they have sufficient income that HUD will judge them capable of paying their rent, and once admitted as tenants they will be evicted should they fail to pay their rent for any reason. Metropolitan’s own witness stated at the hearing in the court of common pleas that 50% of applicants are turned down as poor credit risks, and of the 50% admitted as tenants, many are eventually evicted. The <em>Salvation Army </em>case is thus distinguishable from this case both by reason of the additional educational and personal services provided the residents and the nature of its admission requirements.</p>

Moreover, the social need of governmental and charitable caring for the aged, as well as the importance and necessity for such a benevolent public policy, have become widely recognized and accepted, as medical science in the United States constantly lengthens life expectancy with its resulting increase in the number of needy aged. The elderly, even those who are not completely incapacitated physically, suffer from loneliness, and from mental and physical infirmities which tend to increase as they grow older and their children leave the family home and their contemporaries move away or die. With each passing year, they usually become less and less able to cope with the day-to-day problems of life, including the management of their homes, their proper maintenance and support, and even, at times, their adequate nourishment; and they often live in fear and dread of illness or of some physical disability or possible poverty, or of just plain inability to adequately take care of themselves. It is certainly in the public interest and public welfare that homes and other facilities be established and maintained to relieve these worries and anxieties, these fears and sufferings, and this well-known inability of the aged to adequately care for themselves. Furthermore, it is a matter of common knowledge that pension plans, retirement benefits, and Government-supported programs for the support and care of the elderly greatly aid, but simply do <em>not solve all </em>of the underlying human problems of the aged.” <em>Presbyterian Homes Tax Exemption </em>
