This position would be well taken had the witness merely stated that he had buried <em>one </em>body, but the reference was to a <em>“couple of bodies.” </em>It is difficult to conceive of the jury not treating this testimony as a reference to crimes other than the one for which appellant was being tried. Timely objection was made by counsel for appellant. The misstatement, if that is what it was could have been corrected by an instruction by the court, or by additional questioning by the Commonwealth’s attorney to establish that the witness had made a misstatement. No instruction was given by the court, no correction was attempted and the jury was permitted to consider evidence of possible murders other than the one for which appellant was being tried. We therefore cannot accept the trial court’s view that the jury construed this statement as a premature reference to the burial of the body of the victim in this case.</p>

Thus, fairness dictates that courts should be ever vigilant to prevent the introduction of this type of evidence under the guise that it is being offered to serve some purpose other <em>than to demonstrate the defendant’s propensity to commit the charged crime. </em>An additional reason why we caution trial courts against being innovative in carving out new exceptions to the rule is that evidence of prior criminal activity requires the accused to answer additional charges which were not included in the indictment returned against him. Where the testimony is admissible under the traditional exceptions counsel for an accused can anticipate its introduction and thus prepare a response.
