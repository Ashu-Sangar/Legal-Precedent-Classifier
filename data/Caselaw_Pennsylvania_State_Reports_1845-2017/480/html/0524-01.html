On December 15, 1974 Fant, Rodgers and Collins were at a nightclub from which Fant was ejected as a result of an altercation at the bar. Thereafter a scuffle broke out in the parking lot and Bruce Fisher, the nightclub owner, sprayed mace into the group to restore order. As Fant, Rodgers and Collins were leaving they announced they would return. Shortly thereafter these three, accompanied by appellant, returned to the parking lot. Fant was carrying a rifle and appellant a hand gun. Fant yelled, “Who do I shoot?” to the persons in the parking lot, and the four men entered the nightclub through the front door. Once inside, appellant asked, “Which one is Bruce, where is Bruce?” Bruce Fisher approached the group and appellant said to him, “What are you doing beating on my brother?” Fisher was then struck on the head with a beer bottle by Rodgers. According to the uncontradicted testimony of one witness, during this time the appellant was waving his pistol around as if to cover Fant, who was holding the rifle.</p>
    <p id="b659-8" data-blocks='[["BL_659.8",659,[198,1699,1152,526]]]'>As Fisher turned and walked away from the group, Fant brought his rifle up to waist level and fired, striking Fisher in the back and killing him almost instantly. Fant fired several other shots, one of which struck and killed John Shlosky, a patron, in the rear of the bar. As Fant was firing his rifle, appellant who stood beside him, fired his revolver several times in the nightclub, not hitting either Fisher or Shlosky. One or two other patrons of the lounge were injured by gunfire. A .38 caliber revolver slug was found waist high in the side wall panelling of the lounge.</p>

The fact that upon their arrival at the scene appellant was armed, that he was in a position to hear Fant’s statement in the parking lot, that appellant upon entering the building inquired as to the identity and whereabouts of the victim, Bruce Fisher, his act of waiving the weapon during the encounter, and his actual firing of the weapon several times provide more than sufficient evidence upon which to find appellant was an active partner in the criminal episode. <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>

Appellant stressed the extensive voir dire and the number of excused veniremen as evidence of the alleged community’s hostility toward appellant. We are not convinced that these factors further appellant’s claim since the allowance of an extensive voir dire and liberal rulings on challenges for cause tend to indicate the trial judge’s desire to assure that the trial was conducted before a fair and impartial jury.

Dr. Ayres admittedly was not present during the autopsy, nor did he see the bodies, but rather a funeral director and deputy coroner of Fayette County, Andrew Haky, performed the autopsies. Mr. Haky examined the victims, excised their vital organs and turned those organs over to Dr. Ayres the next day. Mr. Haky testified describing the gunshot wounds and the path and location of the bullets in the victims’ bodies. Dr. Ayres testified that based on his examination of the vital organs, combined with the information supplied by Mr. Haky, Fisher’s death was caused by a gunshot wound of the abdomen with laceration of the liver and inferior vena cava (the large <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>abdominal blood vessel), hemorrhage and cardiac arrest. He testified Shlosky’s death was caused by a gunshot wound of the chest with laceration of the heart and lungs, hemorrhage into the chest cavity and cardiac arrest. Mr. Haky gave no opinion as to cause of death or other medical opinion. Appellant concedes that a medical expert can offer opinion testimony on medical matters based in part upon reports of others which are not in evidence but which the expert customarily relies upon in the practice of his profession. <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/444/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="444 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1938591" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0436-01">444 Pa. 436</a>, 445, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20693" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="282 A.2d 693">282 A.2d 693</a>, 698 (1971). However, appellant argues that the cases have involved reports from other qualified medical personnel, such as a nurse or attending physician, and that Mr. Haky was not so qualified. In each case we must review the qualifications of the individual whose report is being relied upon and the nature of the subject matter covered in that report. Further, it is appropriate to consider his experience in the field, and not limit the inquiry to a standard based solely upon the formal training the witness has received in the field. Mr. Haky testified that he studied pathology at Eckles College of Mortuary Science, assisted pathologists for twenty-five years in approximately five-hundred autopsies, assisted Dr. Ayres in approximately one-hundred and twenty-five autopsies, and performed a number of autopsies alone, two of which were performed on bodies whose death resulted from possible homicides and both of which involved gunshot wounds. Taking into account Haky’s experience, and that the information supplied by him did not include medical opinions but merely facts observed as a result of external and internal examinations, we are satisfied that the report was a proper basis from which Dr. Ayres, in combination with his own examination, could make conclusions “with a reasonable degree of medical certainty” as to the cause of the deaths. <em>Commonwealth v.

The only reason appellant gave for his dissatisfaction with his public defender was that he did not appeal the denial of his motion for change of venue before trial. Since an order on such a motion is interlocutory and cannot be immediately appealed, Pa.R.A.P. 311(a), counsel was not incompetent and, therefore, the lower court properly refused appellant’s request for a change of counsel. An indigent is entitled to free counsel but not free counsel of his own choice. <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the objection of the exclusive use of the voter list for the selection of jurors was waived.</p>
