Stake, husband of Aileen Stake and son-in-law of the decedent, was to the effect that early in March of 1974, the decedent came to the Stake home to have lunch with Aileen and himself. The three discussed the disposition of decedent’s property at his death. Decedent indicated that he wanted to divide his property 50/50 between Aileen and Jane, stating that “If something happens to me that is what I want carried out”. The decedent asked Glenn Stake to take care of it in case something happened to him, but Mr. Stake declined and suggested that Jane and Aileen handle it, and decedent indicated his agreement. Mr. Stake testified that at this point the decedent asked Mr. Stake to write “For Aileen and Jane, Executors” at the top of the Kool-Seal paper on which he had been writing, and Mr. Stake testified that this was done, before the decedent signed the paper and at decedent’s direction.</p>

All of these were signed at the bottom by the decedent, but none were offered for probate. The appellees agree that these were merely lists of the assets of the decedent, for informational purposes only. The paper admitted to probate and the other five inventory sheets were all dated March 2, 1974, and the date was added to the writings by Glenn Stake. The testimony is confusing as to whether or not the papers were actually prepared on March 2, 1974. However, no one contests that the paper admitted to probate was prepared on or about the date of March 2, 1974, a date substantially later than June 28, 1961, the date of the other will.</p>
    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[149,1070,1157,410]]]'>Mrs. Stake testified that during the course of the preparation of the paper admitted to probate, the decedent stated “that he was sorry for the way he had treated us for the last few years and wanted to make some changes; he was going to make a will and do for Jane and I and his grandchildren, which he had not done for many years; and he was sorry for the way things had gone.” She further testified that the decedent said that he wanted her and Jane to have the farm:</p>

She said that when the decedent was in the hospital, suffering from a stroke, he mentioned leaving the farm to her, as he had on previous occasions. She further testified that the 1961 instrument was found in the decedent’s safe at the farm, after his death. Mrs. Brisson testified as to the comings and goings of the decedent at or about March 2, 1974 and stated that the decedent was at home on the farm on that date, which testimony was corroborated in part by Jay Lawson, decedent’s brother-in-law and a visitor to the farm on that date. As stated before, it is not certain that the instrument admitted to probate was actually prepared on that date, even though that date appears on the instrument.</p>

Appellant argues that the writing does not indicate to whom the property is to go, since the paper is addressed to Aileen and Jane as executors and not as legatees. Appellant further contends that because they were not written by the decedent, the words, “For Aileen and Jane, Executors,” may not be considered a part of his alleged will and must be presumed to be an addition made after the testator signed the paper and without his knowledge.</p>

    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[152,475,1158,586]]]'>There is no language in the instrument which is testamentary in nature except the word “Executors,” inserted by Glenn Stake. Use of the word, however, does not evidence a testamentary intent absent further indication that decedent was thereby either appointing his executors or naming them as his beneficiaries. In fact, “For Aileen &amp; Jane Executors,” followed by a bare listing of assets without dispositive language, supports appellant’s theory that this was a list addressed to his daughters for their future reference in settling his estate, not an attempted testamentary disposition.</p>

Although the word “For” might have dispositive significance if coupled with extrinsic evidence that it was inserted pursuant to decedent’s declarations concerning disposition of his property, this simply is not the case. Both Aileen and Glenn Stake testified that the decedent asked Glenn to be his executor, he refused and suggested the daughters; $nd Glenn then added these words to the top of the paper upon which the decedent was writing. This phrase, therefore, even most liberally construed, can be no more than appointment of executors. It cannot be taken to indicate the beneficiaries of a will.</p>

This may be a reasonable construction. However, unless it is shown that this instrument was intended to be his will, and not a listing for future reference or a memorandum for his use in having a will drafted, the clarity of his scheme is immaterial. What is required for a valid will is the intent to make that writing, not a future writing, a testamentary disposition. Instructions and memoranda for use in drawing a will do not show this requisite intent. <em>Estate of Moore, </em><a href="/pa/443/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="443 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1936980" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0477-01">443 Pa. 477</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="277 A.2d 825">277 A.2d 825</a> (1971); <em>Estate of Richards, </em><a href="/pa/439/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="439 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="1931020" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0005-01">439 Pa. 5</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20658" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="264 A.2d 658">264 A.2d 658</a> (1970). The appearance of this instrument, the starkness of the language (i. e. “all assets 50/50”) without use of any dispositive terms, and the simple form used, listing asset below asset, all indicate that this is a memorandum rather than a will. Although form is not a determinative factor, it is an element which may be considered. <em>Kaufmann’s Estate, supra. </em>The decedent had previously executed a will which, although unsophisticated, indicates some knowledge of the customary form and style of such a document.

This writing differs only in the heading “For Aileen &amp; Jane, Executors”, which we have already determined has no dispositive significance even if, as found by the court, it was added at the decedent’s direction and prior to his signing of the instrument. Appellees admit that the other five writings were merely lists of assets dictated by the decedent, and therefore appellees did not attempt probate of any of the other signed notations. When six very similar writings are prepared at the same time, the character of the other five may point to the character of the one offered for probate. There is very little upon which the five papers conceded not to be wills can be distinguished from the one purported to be a will, except a phrase admittedly not added by the decedent himself.</p>

The 1961 will, although rough in form, stands in sharp contrast to the paper admitted to probate. The decedent used testamentary and dispositive language, clearly named his beneficiary and described in some detail the property to be passed. Furthermore, the decedent was a businessman and had some knowledge of the significance of his will. The man who fully wrote out the 1961 will, had it notarized and kept it locked in his safe would be unlikely to think that he had executed a valid, revoking will merely by jotting down his assets in a list format, signing his name, and leaving the papers — without any instructions for either their use or their safekeeping — at his daughter’s home. Although the validity of the former will is not here in issue, its form and the formality of its execution are part of the facts in evidence <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>from which we may draw the reasonable inference that, by contrast, the probated writing was not intended to be a will.</p>

Among these are the daughter Aileen’s statement that “If I had known it would mean this much, I would have gotten a decent piece of paper” and the decedent’s wife’s testimony that, <em>after </em>March 2, 1974 the decedent told her that he was <em>“going to </em>fix it” so that the girls would have the farm.

This Court now reverses on the theory that the holographic instrument involved was no more than a listing of assets from which a will was later to be prepared and that it was lacking in that testamentary character which is an indispensable attribute of a will.
