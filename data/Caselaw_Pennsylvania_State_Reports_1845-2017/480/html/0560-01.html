An argument eventually broke out between appellant and the victim. Mr. Crowther called appellant several names and when appellant told the victim “you can’t back it up,” Mr. Crowther attempted to attack appellant. Appellant sidestepped Crowther, grabbing him around the neck and turning him around. Appellant then punched Crowther in the face, knocking him to the floor. According to appellant’s confession, he then “stomped” on Crowther’s face. At trial, appellant testified that he placed his foot on the victim’s throat in an attempt to restrain him.</p>

That was inside the upper lip. The upper lip also appeared swollen and there was bleeding into the tissues of the upper lip. The lower lip showed a similar laceration approximately a quarter of an inch in length. There was hemorrhage in the gums and the tissue of the lower lip on the inner aspect.

From the heart to the main distribution of blood this valve was hardened and did not function normally. The arteries that supply the heart muscle, called the coronary muscles, showed marked, that is, rather severe blockage of the inside with atherosclerosis. That is hardening of the arteries.

The injury in the kidney was in a separate site and I couldn’t relate that in any way to the injuries at the top of the body.

The injuries to the front of the face were caused by some object striking the face <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>or the face striking an object. This is called blunt force injury. The lacerations of the inside of the lip, in my opinion, were due to the lips being pressed up forcefully against the teeth and being lacerated. Again, the injury to the kidney area and the back of the neck and scalp were due to a force being applied to the skin of the back of the head. The injury deep in the neck, the one I described around the spinal cord, in my opinion, was due to the neck being moved in an abnormal way so that the tissues tore and there was hemorrhage.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[170,492,1153,636]]]'>The jury was originally sent out to deliberate before lunch on October 20, 1976. At 6:30 p. m., the jury had sent out a series of questions which the court answered. The court then sent the jury to dinner and asked if anyone had any objections to continuing deliberations after dinner. No objections were entered. At 11:20 p. m., the jury came back with more questions. After being reinstructed, the court asked the jury if they wished to continue deliberating or would they rather retire for the night. The jury indicated they would rather retire and the judge acceded to their wishes. The jury began deliberating the next day at 9:30 a. m. and brought back its verdict at 11:10 a. m.</p>
