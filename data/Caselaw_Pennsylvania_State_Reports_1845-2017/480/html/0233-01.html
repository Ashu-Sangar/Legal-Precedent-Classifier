Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to five consecutive terms of life imprisonment. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b372-11" data-blocks='[["BL_372.11",372,[239,1400,1150,303]]]'>Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. However, because this case involves convictions for murder of the first degree, this court has an independent duty to review the evidence. Act of February 15, 1870, P.L. 15, § 2, 19 P.S. § 1187. The evidence produced at trial is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b372-12" data-blocks='[["BL_372.12",372,[237,1735,1151,473]]]'>On January 27, 1975, at approximately 9:25 or 9:30 a. m., appellant “discovered” the bodies of his wife, three children and the children’s grandfather at the family home at 1050-52 West 26th Street, Erie. At the time of the crime, appellant was separated from his wife and was living at 627 West 32nd Street, Erie. When he discovered the bodies, appellant notified a neighbor, Edwin Rosenzweig. After going to the scene of the killing and observing the bodies, Rosenzweig called the police.</p>

Paul was covered with a <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>blood-soaked parka (appellant claimed he covered the body upon discovery). David Chism, age 9, had been shot five times, once from very close range. Appellant’s six-year-old daughter, Annamaria, had been shot four times, once from close range. Paul Tolis, age 75 and the children’s grandfather, had been shot four times. All four of these individuals were dressed in night clothes. The blood surrounding these bodies was dry and the bodies were cold to the touch. Rigor mortis was beginning to set in.</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[177,837,1151,305]]]'>Police also found the body of appellant’s wife, Athena, who had been shot three times at close range. Athena Chism worked the midnight shift in an allnight diner and was dressed in her working clothes. Her body was still warm and subsequent examination revealed that she had died two to three hours after the other four victims.</p>

Although at the time appellant was not a suspect, he was given his <em>Miranda </em>rights. A trace metal test was administered to appellant and fingernail scrapings were taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant then conferred with Erie County District Attorney Robert Chase and Erie Police Detective Sergeant Donald Levis for the purpose of helping authorities investigate the crime.</p>

After stopping at a Texaco gasoline station at 32nd and Cherry, appellant went to a car wash at 38th and Liberty. He claimed he then went to a store before going to the 26th Street house and discovering the bodies. He told police he entered the house through the side door, which was always open because there was no key to the door. Appellant also told police that robbery or burglary could have been a possible motive for <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>the slayings. He claimed that although he and his wife had been separated, they had sold the 26th Street house and were planning to move to Florida. Appellant further stated that, at the closing for the sale of their home, the couple received a check for over $16,000. According to appellant, his wife had cashed this check and had the $16,000 somewhere in the house, although he didn’t know where. He also claimed that his wife had been carrying over $8,000 in her purse.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[251,846,1152,419]]]'>At trial, officers testified that the house, on first inspection, looked like it had been ransacked by burglars. However, the officers doubted that burglary was the motive, as too many valuable items were left behind, including an extensive coin collection of Mr. Tolis’. Further, an officer testified that while drawers were thrown on the floor of the house, the items inside the drawers were left undisturbed, further negating a possible burglary.</p>
    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[250,1290,1152,251]]]'>At the time of his conference with the investigating authorities, appellant was told that the spent cartridges were from a .22 caliber weapon. He admitted that he had bought a .22 caliber rifle for his oldest son, Paul, but he claimed not to know where it was.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.7",374,[248,1574,1152,418]]]'>Police informed appellant that they were going to search both the house on 26th Street and his apartment. When he asked why a search of his apartment was necessary, appellant was informed that police were checking for traces of blood on his clothing and in other places.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant then told police that some of his clothing would certainly contain traces of blood from having covered his son Paul’s body with the coat.

The rifle was the one purchased by appellant. Subsequent tests showed that this rifle was indeed the murder weapon. At trial, witnesses also testified <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>that appellant was familiar with hiding places in the attic, as they had seen him hide various items in the attic.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[170,436,1150,623]]]'>Traces of blood were discovered in numerous places in appellant’s apartment and automobile and on various items of clothing. Traces of both type 0 and type B blood were found almost everywhere in the bathroom. The blood deposited in appellant’s apartment and automobile could not have been placed there merely by discovering his son’s body, because when police arrived at the crime scene shortly after appellant allegedly discovered the bodies, the blood was already dry. Moreover, a witness who spent four to five days a week at appellant’s apartment testified that he had never seen nor heard of anyone bleeding profusely in the bathroom at appellant’s apartment.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[171,1078,1150,359]]]'>Police were able to find numerous witnesses who contradicted parts of appellant’s narrative. While appellant told police that he didn’t leave his apartment until 8:30 on the morning of the killings, two neighbors testified that appellant’s car was not in its normal parking place between 7:00 a. m. and 7:45 a. m. Another witness testified that he noticed appellant’s car at his wife’s house at 8:25 a. m.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[170,1456,1152,253]]]'>Various witnesses testified that they had heard appellant threaten to kill his wife. In fact, appellant’s mother was visiting five months before the murder when appellant told her “The next time you see me I’ll be behind bars and she [Athena Chism] will be dead.”</p>
    <p id="b375-8" data-blocks='[["BL_375.8",375,[170,1727,1151,201]]]'>It was also established at trial that appellant, and not his wife, had cashed the check from the sale of the house. A handwriting expert testified that, in his opinion, appellant had forged his wife’s signature on the back of the check.</p>
    <p id="b375-9" data-blocks='[["BL_375.9",375,[171,1946,1151,308]]]'>It was also shown at trial that the buyer of the 26th Street residence discovered a key behind a grate which used to house a gas heater. When tested, the key opened the side door which appellant claimed was always open because of the lack of a key. Further, traces of both type 0 and type B blood were found on the grate and the key.</p>

When police searched the house at 1050-52 West 26th Street, they did so without a warrant. Because of this, appellant believes the following should have been suppressed: the murder weapon found in the attic; the box the weapon was purchased in which was found in the cellar; other information concerning the purchase of the rifle; and the testimony of Robert McWhirter, who testified that he had seen appellant hide items in the attic. We believe, however, that all of these pieces of evidence and the testimony of Robert McWhirter were properly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b376-9" data-blocks='[["BL_376.7",376,[235,1902,1151,311]],["BL_377.1",377,[184,291,1150,300]]]'>The facts pertinent to this issue are as follows. Following the discovery of the bodies, appellant accompanied police to headquarters to help them investigate the crime. He told police about the sale of the house,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and told police that his wife had hidden a large amount of money somewhere in the house. He also informed police that Athena Chism had been <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>carrying $8,000 in her purse. When police asked for permission to search the house for both the money and the purse, appellant gave police permission. In his brief, appellant admits to consenting to the search, but claims that his consent was limited to the first floor where all the bodies were found.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[184,618,1150,355]]]'>The suppression court denied appellant’s motion to suppress on three alternative grounds: (1) appellant consented to the search of the house; (2) appellant lacked standing to contest the search; and (3) appellant abandoned the property in question.

Appellant was not under arrest at the time consent was given. As previously pointed out, appellant admits his consent was valid, but argues that he consented only to a search of the first floor of the residence. Again, the record contains no indication of such a limitation, and we therefore <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>hold that appellant consented to the search of the entire West 26th Street residence.

Rigazzi described these items at the trial. Appellant argues that Rigazzi should not have been permitted to do so because they were obtained as a result of an illegal search. We have already rejected that claim. Appellant also argues that the testimony was irrelevant. We reject that argument as well. Evidence is relevant if it tends to increase or decrease the probability of a material fact. <em>Commonwealth v.

Chase explained the omission by stating that in his judgment Levis could not have written down everything that was discussed at that time. Appellant objected on the basis that it is improper for a district attorney to express a personal opinion on a matter within the province of the jury. He claims to have been prejudiced because the evidence was the basis of a question asked later of an expert witness. Appellant relies on <em>Commonwealth v.

Clinger testified that appellant told her on a number of occasions during July and August of 1974 (approximately six to seven months prior to the homicides) that he was having marital problems and that he said on a number of occasions that he would kill his wife and children. Appellant argues that the threats were too remote in time from the actual killings for evidence of them to be admissible. This objection is merit-less. The testimony indicated ill will on the part of appellant, evidence of which is admissible in any homicide case. <em>Commonwealth v.

MacDonnell made an examination of the scene of the killings, in the course of which he examined the parka that covered the body of Paul Chism. He observed that the parka was extensively stained with blood. The Commonwealth sought to discredit appellant’s story that he covered the body with the parka at the time he said he discovered it. The Commonwealth referred to testimony by three witnesses. Edwin Rosenzweig said that when he went to the scene with appellant, he saw dried blood on the parka and was able to recognize it as blood because he had handled dead bodies while in the Army during World War II. A police officer testified that he found the body cold to the touch at 9:50 a. m. A deputy coroner who arrived at the scene at 9:56 a. m. testified that he found signs of rigor mortis. MacDonnell testified that if the testimony that the Commonwealth referred to were accepted, Paul Chism would have had to have been dead for at least one to two hours before the witnesses observed the body. He said that the parka could not have been stained as it was if it were placed on the body as much as a half hour after death, meaning that it must have been put there before appellant claimed to have done so. Appellant argues that MacDonnell’s opinion was based on facts not established by the record. If that were so, it would have been improper to admit the testimony. <em>Collins v.

When the trial court failed to charge the jury on the penalty for voluntary manslaughter after defining the penalties for first, second, and third degree murder, the jury could reasonably infer that the trial judge did not believe that a verdict of voluntary manslaughter would be appropriate. It is true that the statute only requires a judge to instruct that jury as to the penalties for first, second, and third degree murder. But here the jury was unaware of the fact that the only reason they were not given the penalty for voluntary manslaughter was that it was not required by statute. Therefore, the jury was free to infer that it would not even be appropriate to consider voluntary manslaughter as a reasonable finding of guilt. Trial counsel should have requested an additional charge and by failing to do so was ineffective.</p>
