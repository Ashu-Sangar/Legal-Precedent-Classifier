The record discloses that in 1967 Jonathan Smith, 21 years of age, was a resident at the Hillcrest School, a privately operated boarding school for retarded children and juveniles <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>near Hawley, Pennsylvania. William Daniels was employed at the school as a night attendant. According to the testimony of numerous former residents at the school, Smith was a target of a pattern of physical abuse either directed by or performed by Daniels. Smith was beaten from time to time, either by Daniels or by others acting at his direction, and once suffered a broken arm as a consequence. On at least one occasion Smith was tied in a spread-eagle fashion to his bed. He was deprived of food. He was put out of the school’s dormitory while partially clothed or naked, and exposed to the cold for varying lengths of time. One distinctive form of abuse was “the drink,” in which Smith was placed in a bathtub and forcibly held under water and deprived of air for a period of time.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[240,1087,1155,1123]],["BL_476.1",476,[247,314,1152,88]]]'>Repeated abuses of this sort continued until Smith’s death on the morning of May 19, 1967. Dr. Hobart Owens, the school’s physician, testified that Smith had been suffering from influenza pneumonia for some ten days prior to his death; other witnesses testified that he had been ill for some two weeks. During this period, Smith was running a high temperature; other symptoms included coughing, abnormal sweating, shaking and lethargy. Despite this illness, appellant ordered Smith on the night before his death to “run wetters,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> a form of punishment. Some time later, Norman Murray and James Sipes, two residents of the school, were ordered by appellant to take Smith from the dormitory and throw him naked over a nearby embankment. The school was located on high ground and witnesses testified that the weather at the time was cold, with snow on the ground. Smith was out of doors for a period from one-half hour to an hour. When he was allowed to return to the building, he was shivering noticeably and asked for medical attention. Instead, Daniels ordered him to resume “running wetters.” One witness testified that Smith was subjected to “the drink” on the same night; another testified that the <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>last such incident was one or two nights before Smith’s death.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[244,431,1155,523]]]'>Several hours after these events, Smith went to the bathroom, asked for a drink of water, collapsed and died. Appellant, who had told Smith “. . . you better not die on my shift,” had already left the premises, leaving Murray in charge until the day shift arrived. On Smith’s death certificate Dr. Owens stated the cause of death to be a pulmonary embolism. Smith’s body, being unclaimed, was sent to Temple University Medical School in Philadelphia on the day of his death, and was eventually cremated. No autopsy was ever performed.</p>

He testified that in his opinion the cause of Smith’s death was bronchial pneumonia, which was the result of the following “multiple contributing factors:” “the dehydration, the physical abuse which has weakened this deceased ... a prior ongoing infection . . . weakening him, making him more susceptible to the effects of abuse both physical and climatologic, and the accelerating process of pneumonia causing his death.” Dr. Fillinger further testified that, assuming the truth of the events described by the former residents, “[t]he circumstances described . . . both in times several days to several weeks prior to his demise and specifically on the night of his death, indicate clearly — particularly those circumstances that occurred shortly before his death — a series of episodes which accelerated his diseased process and brought about his death,” and that Smith’s exposure to the cold on the night before he died “had a marked accelerating effect upon his demise.” The Commonwealth produced another medical witness, Dr. Marvin Aranson, who also qualified as an expert in forensic pathology. It was Dr. Aranson’s opinion that the cause of Smith’s death was “a pneumonia due to the exposure to the water [“the drink”], the exposure to the cold temperatures, and aggravated by the other factors of beatings and starvation.” He also testified that, in his opinion, “[t]he non-medical treatment of beat<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>ings, starvation and exposure would be that which made an otherwise healthy 23-year old or 22-year old die from this disease, which healthy people in this age group do not usually die from.”</p>

The second part of the argument, which is that Dr. Fillinger’s testimony was insufficient to warrant the jury’s conclusion that death occurred by means of a criminal agency, is similarly misplaced, for it ignores the clearly sufficient evidence given by Dr. Aranson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.7",478,[221,547,1157,1160]]]'>Dr. Fillinger testified that he had conducted an investigation into the death of Jonathan Smith. His testimony showed that he had made use of the following sources in arriving at his opinion: interviews with former residents of the school (all of whom testified for the Commonwealth concerning Smith’s symptoms); certain hospital records (Commonwealth’s Exhibit # 9, the hematology and serology reports); the death certificate (Commonwealth’s Exhibit #8); a letter from and a conversation with a person who had performed a dissection of a body believed to be that of the deceased;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> the testimony the doctor had heard during the trial; and certain police reports concerning Smith’s death. Dr. Fillinger was asked whether, as a result of this investigation, he had come to an opinion regarding the cause and manner of Smith’s death. He answered in the affirmative and, over objection, was permitted to testify to that opinion. The doctor later testified in answer to a hypothetical question that assuming the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses to be true, the incidents of physical and other abuse set forth by those witnesses “indicate clearly” a direct causal relationship between the abuse and Smith’s death. No objection was made to this hypothetical question.</p>

It is argued that either insanity or alibi defenses might have been available to appellant had his arrest come sooner, but these assertions are no more than speculation. Indeed, appellant’s own testimony established his regular employment on the night shift at the school and his presence there on the night before Smith’s death, and the identification testimony relative to Daniels was substantial and unequivocal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Loss of memory is also alleged by Daniels, but this claim also is undermined by his trial testimony.

Appellant repeats here one of his principal contentions at trial, <em>viz., </em>that the body examined by Dr. Rauchwuenger was not that of Jonathan Smith. The argument is based on the fact that during the course of his testimony Dr. Fillinger stated at one point that the dissection was performed in June, 1970. The appellant countered this statement with evidence tending to show that Smith’s corpse was cremated in February, 1969. But the doctor made two other references to the time of the dissection in his testimony, and both times stated that the dissection was a continuing process begun in June, 1967. Thus the question of whether the body examined was actually that of Jonathan Smith was one for the jury to resolve in deciding the weight to be accorded the doctor’s opinion, and the jury was so instructed by the trial judge. It should also be noted that Dr. Fillinger testified that the findings of Dr. Rauchwuenger did not contribute to Fillinger’s conclusion that the cause of Smith’s death was bronchial pneumonia, but rather showed that the dissection revealed no evidence to support a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which had been the opinion of the school doctor, Dr. Owens.</p>

According to Trooper Robert Bemathy, the State Police inquiry into numerous suspicious deaths at the Hillcrest School began in October 1972, and.over 100 former residents, who by this time were widely dispersed, were interviewed. Adding to the difficulties were the residents’ mental retardation and the absence of the deceased’s body. The record also discloses that appellant had no prior criminal record.
