    <p id="b338-8" data-blocks='[["BL_338.9",338,[243,781,1154,626]]]'>Appellant, Ronald E. Holland, was tried by a judge sitting with a jury and was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in connection with the shooting death of Michael Timchattin. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to five to ten years in prison and a $250 fine. This appeal followed. The facts surrounding this homicide are as follows. Appellant and the decedent were both employees of Reynolds Metal Company. The decedent was appellant’s foreman. The working relationship between appellant and the decedent was strained as a result of cross-complaints concerning labor grievances that they had filed against each other.</p>
    <p id="b338-9" data-blocks='[["BL_338.10",338,[241,1437,1155,636]]]'>On September 18, 1978, appellant was in the Village Cafe West drinking. While in the bar, appellant complained about the decedent to a co-worker, Michael Mortimer. Appellant left the Village Cafe West and walked across the street to Sbandi’s Bar, where the decedent had arrived approximately fifteen minutes earlier. Appellant entered the bar and confronted the decedent. A verbal exchange took place concerning the working disagreements that existed between the two. Appellant then left the bar. Within a few minutes the decedent also left Sbandi’s. Within minutes, shots were heard and the decedent staggered back into the bar and collapsed.</p>

The Commonwealth does not contest that the suppression court properly suppressed any testimony or evidence concerning Bell’s identification of appellant at Chester Police Station; rather, the Commonwealth contends that the Bell identification had an independent basis.

      <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>The facts surrounding appellant’s contention are: Appellant at the time of his arrest had long hair, sideburns and a mustache and was unshaven. He was photographed by police after his arrest with the above features. However, he appeared at his preliminary hearing with short cropped hair and no mustache, beard or sideburns. At the preliminary hearing, Bell failed to positively identify appellant. At the suppression hearing, he explained that his failure to identify appellant was based on his “new” appearance. Bell positively identified two police photographs taken at the time of appellant’s arrest. These photographs depicted appellant with his “old” appearance of long hair, sideburns, mustache and beard. We do not believe that Bell’s failure to identify appellant at the preliminary hearing tainted his independent recollection and the suppression court did not err in determining that an independent basis existed for Bell’s identification.</p>

Hinton testified at trial that appellant purchased ammunition of the same type that was found in the decedent’s body.</p>

On June 18, 1974, pursuant to a defense motion, a mistrial was granted. On August 19, 1974, appellant filed a motion to suppress.

In the suppression motion appellant named Gloria <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>Restaneo, Lloyd Bell, John Williams, Jr., and William Mola, but there was no mention of Joseph Hinton. On September 9, 1974, the court suppressed certain testimony of the above witnesses, but allowed Bell and Williams to testify because of its determination of an independent recollection as to identity.</p>

On September 10, during the district attorney’s opening, he described what the testimony of Hinton would be and stated that Hinton had identified appellant at a photographic lineup. On September 11, defense filed a petition to suppress the photographic identification. The court held an in camera hearing to determine the basis of this supplemental petition to suppress. Defense counsel contended that the opening statement of the district attorney was his first knowledge of Hinton, of his testimony, and of the uncounselled photographic “lineup.” The court below denied appellant’s supplemental suppression motion as untimely filed. The court concluded that appellant had failed to undertake any pretrial discovery or investigation to ascertain the whereabouts of the witnesses listed on the bill of indictment and had not attempted to interview any of the witnesses.</p>

We do not agree. Newlin’s testimony centered around an argument between appellant and the decedent moments prior to the shooting. Defense counsel sought to use a transcript of the testimony of Gloria Restaneo in order to impeach Newlin’s testimony concerning the identity of appellant. The Restaneo testimony was given at a habeas corpus hearing involving one Lawrence Robbins, a friend of appellant. Restaneo at the habeas corpus hearing identified Robbins as the person she saw fleeing the homicide scene. Defense counsel attempted to question Newlin as to whether he knew of Restaneo’s identification of Robbins as the perpetrator of the crime.

We do not agree. As previously stated, Bishop was the personnel manager of Reynolds Metal Company. Bishop’s direct testimony centered around verifying the record-keeping system of Reynolds and his compilation of the documents containing appellant’s signature for Detective Lentz to be used for comparison purposes. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to ascertain whether the records of Reynolds established any dispute between appellant and the decedent, and whether the decedent ever recommended that appellant be fired. After a brief re-direct by the district attorney, defense counsel on re-cross established that subsequent to the incident in this case, appellant’s employment was terminated by Reynolds. Defense counsel attempted to determine why appellant was fired. The district attorney objected, saying that the issue was irrelevant and beyond the scope of direct and re-direct examination. Defense counsel at sidebar made an offer of proof that he expected to show bias on the part of Bishop, because if the defendant was acquitted, Bishop would be held responsible by Reynolds, as he recommended the termi<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>nation.
