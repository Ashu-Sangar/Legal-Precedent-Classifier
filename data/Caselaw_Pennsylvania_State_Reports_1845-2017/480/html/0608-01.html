Pleas of Washington County, Orphans’ Court Division, its third and partial account in which it charged against appellant’s share of the corpus as compensation for its services the sum of $17,045. Appellant objected that this amount was in excess of the amount which the bank had agreed to charge against corpus when the trust was created. After an evidentiary hearing on the matter, the auditing judge confirmed the amount requested by the bank and subsequently dismissed appellant’s exceptions and made his decree final.

Baker, the husband of the settlor’s daughter and the proposed co-trustee of two trusts Anne A. Duncan planned to establish, outlining his understanding of the proposed trusts. In that letter he indicated that if the bank were named corporate trustee its compensation “upon corpus at termination” would be 2% in the “Duncan Trust,” not here involved, and <em>3% </em>in the “Baker Trust,” involved instantly. He further noted that “the additional charge upon corpus in the Baker Trust is made on account of the greater length of time it will operate.”</p>

He based this conclusion on two grounds. First, he concluded there was no evidence that Walter H. Baker was authorized to act for the settlor in negotiating the terms of the bank’s compensation with the bank’s vice-president or that the settlor had agreed to the terms outlined in the vice-president’s letter of August 14, 1935. Second, he concluded that even if there was an <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>agreement between the settlor and the bank, to enforce the contract reflected in the August 14 letter would be contrary to public policy because the evidence indicated that Mr. Baker took advantage of his positions as director of the bank and president of a large steel company, which company was a depositor of the bank, to obtain a “special deal” from the bank not available to its other customers, and because there was a conflict of interest between Mr. Baker’s duties as a director of the bank and his desire to reduce the amount of compensation his descendants, as beneficiaries of the trust, would have to pay the bank for its services. Thus, disregarding Section 7185(c) as inapplicable, the judge determined that the amount requested by the bank was reasonable compensation for its services pursuant to Section 7185(a). Alternatively, he concluded that even if there was an enforceable contract, the bank was entitled to the amount requested as compensation for extraordinary services over and above the services contemplated by the parties at the time the trust was created.</p>

The determination that there was no valid agreement governing compensation and the grounds supporting it appear to have been injected sua sponte into the judge’s opinion in support of his decree. In adjudicating the exceptions to his decree, however, the judge was performing an essentially appellate function. It was error for him in this capacity to make a sua sponte determination on the basis of issues not raised or litigated by the parties. See <em>Coleman v.

An exception to the general rule, in circumstances where the trustee has performed extraordinary services beyond those contemplated by the parties or where the compensation fixed by the agreement is so low that the unwillingness of a competent trustee to continue or undertake to administer the trust would defeat or substantially impair its purposes, is well recognized.

We conclude, however, that where a trustee seeks to avoid the terms of the agreement by showing extraordinary services beyond the contemplation or reasonable expectation of the parties, the proof of their extraordinary nature, as well as their extent and value to the trust, must be clear and convincing; it is not sufficient merely to show that the terms agreed upon by the parties no longer appear, with the benefit of hindsight, to be reasonable for the services actually performed. As the Supreme Court of California stated in rejecting a trustee’s claim for additional compensation: <em>“ . . </em>. the trustee should be required to show in detail the nature and extent of [the extraordinary] services rendered by it . . . and the time and effort entailed thereby over and beyond usual and ordinary services.” <em>Estate of Bissinger, </em><a href="/cal-2d/60/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="60 Cal. 2d 756" data-case-ids="2339267" data-case-paths="/cal-2d/60/0756-01">60 Cal.2d 756</a>, 771, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20450" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="36 Cal.

The July 17, 1935, letter from the bank’s vice-president indicates that the parties were aware that the “Baker Trust” would likely be of extended duration; because of the size and nature of the trust’s holdings, it must have been apparent that the corporate trustee would during this extended period of time be called upon to expend considerable effort with regard to management of the corpus. In particular, the instrument makes specific reference to the possibilities that the trustee might be called upon to participate in mergers and liquidations, to receive additions to the corpus, and to deal in real estate. As for the unanticipated services rendered by the bank following the death of Anne A. Duncan, the bank’s witnesses testified that these were rendered gratuitously to the settlor’s estate at the request of her executor; although there was testimony that the trust was a legatee of half of the settlor’s residuary estate, the bank made no showing that its services to the estate were of any particular value or necessary to the trust.</p>
