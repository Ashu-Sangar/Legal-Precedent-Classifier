Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to two terms of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, the terms to run consecutively. This direct appeal followed.</p>

Appellant claims he was denied due process of law when the trial court refused his request to sequester the prosecution’s witnesses, some of whom placed Fant at the scene of the killings and others who testified they witnessed Fant actually do the shooting. We agree with appellant that under the circumstances of this case, in which appellant was never identified at a <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>pretrial lineup, photographic lineup, showup, or other pretrial identification procedure, the trial court’s refusal to sequester witnesses was an abuse of discretion which dictates that appellant be granted a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b721-5" data-blocks='[["BL_721.5",721,[163,534,1151,520]]]'>According to prosecution witnesses, several men were involved in a minor skirmish inside the Wishing Well Lounge in Uniontown, Pennsylvania at approximately 1:30 a.m. on December 15, 1974. Three of the men, whom prosecution witnesses identified at trial as appellant and two companions, were ejected from the nightclub. Another altercation then took place in the parking lot. The nightclub’s owner, Bruce Fisher, sprayed some mace into the scuffling group in order to restore order. The three men left by automobile, vowing to return.</p>
    <p id="b721-6" data-blocks='[["BL_721.6",721,[164,1072,1153,417]]]'>Shortly thereafter four men returned. Two of the men were black and two were white. One was brandishing a rifle; one carried a handgun. The four men entered the nightclub through the front door. Fisher approached the four and was struck on the head with a beer bottle. As Fisher turned and began to walk away, one of the men shot him in the back. The same man then fired several more shots, killing one of the nightclub’s patrons.</p>
    <p id="b721-7" data-blocks='[["BL_721.7",721,[163,1509,1153,627]]]'>Appellant was arrested the following morning. Between the time of appellant’s arrest and trial — approximately nine months — no identification procedures were utilized in an effort to have any of the prosecution’s witnesses identify appellant as the person responsible for the killings at the Wishing Well Lounge. The prosecution has not offered an explanation for its failure to utilize a photographic array, to conduct a lineup or showup, or to make any other efforts to obtain an identification of appellant prior to the initiation of judicial proceedings. At the preliminary hearing, however, the record indicates that the only witnesses who testified stated that they could not identify appellant as the killer.</p>

Because defense counsel’s motion to have the witnesses sequestered was denied, appellant was repeatedly identified by witnesses who had heard numerous other witnesses testify during the trial that appellant was present at the Wishing Well Lounge or was the one who fired the fatal shots. These witnesses identified appellant for the first time not from a lineup including other black males of similar physical characteristics, but while he was seated at counsel's table in open court, the only black man present, and after he had been charged with two murders. The suggestiveness inherent in these identifications of appellant is, in our view, palpably clear.</p>

A criminal trial, at the very least, should aim at truthful fact-finding, including accurate eyewitness identifications. This is true whether the identification occurs at a pretrial lineup or within the four walls of the courtroom. For obvious reasons, all of society has an interest in accurate criminal identifications. To this end, we have required that police administrators and prosecutors adopt procedures that will give fair assurance against the dreaded consequences of misidentification. A review of this case finds such assurances completely wanting.</p>

For example, the first prosecution witness to identify appellant as the killer — one Margaret Ruehmling— did so after twelve other witnesses had testified either that they saw appellant at the Wishing Well Lounge that night, or that they saw appellant approach the establishment with a rifle. The psychological pressures that influence a witness to positively identify someone after that witness has watched twelve others identify that same person as being at the scene can be overwhelming. The trial court’s decision would have been on a much different footing had some or all of the witnesses previously identified appellant at some type of fairly conducted, pre-trial identification procedure.

It makes no sense to argue that it was a proper exercise of discretion to deny such a request because more than one witness testified to that “fact”. Where, as here, witnesses identifying appellant did so for the first time in the highly <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>suggestive setting of an open court; where that suggestive identification was the first time in nine months that many of the witnesses were asked if appellant was the person they saw on the night in question; and where witnesses, after the first prosecution witness testified, heard anywhere from one to sixteen other persons identify the appellant, we must agree with appellant that his conviction, based almost entirely on eyewitness testimony, was so unfairly obtained as to violate due process of law. <em>See, e. g., Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em><a href="/us/388/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="388 U.S. 293" data-case-ids="6168284" data-case-paths="/us/388/0293-01">388 U.S. 293</a>, 299, <a href="/us/388/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="388 U.S. 293" data-case-ids="6168284" data-case-paths="/us/388/0293-01">87 S.Ct. 1967</a>, 1971, <a href="/us/388/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="388 U.S. 293" data-case-ids="6168284" data-case-paths="/us/388/0293-01">18 L.Ed.2d 1199</a>, 1205 (1967) (“it remains open to all persons to allege and prove . that the confrontation resulted in such unfairness that it infringed his [or her] right to due process of law”).</p>

So also are the background facts which lend verity or cast doubt upon the witnesses’ ability to make a reliable identification. As Justice (now Chief Justice) Eagen observed in <em>Commonwealth v.
