The suit claimed damages in excess of five million dollars for delays and other problems allegedly caused by the Philadelphia Port Corporation (Port Corporation), an agency of the City to which management and supervision of the construction of the Tioga Marine Terminal had been delegated. The procedural complexities of the litigation are not relevant here and need not be discussed. Suffice it to say that the matter was eventually scheduled for trial. On November 22, 1976, at a pretrial conference held the day before the scheduled commencement of trial, City orally moved to disqualify plaintiff’s. co-counsel from participation in the case. City’s motion was based on alleged violations of Canons 4, 5, and 9, of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>

In a memorandum opinion filed subsequent to this order, the trial court stated that it had denied City’s motion to disqualify because it was untimely. The trial court did not discuss the merits of City’s position. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed in a per curiam opinion, stating simply that “[t]he motion to disqualify was untimely filed.” <em>American Dredging Co. </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa-super/246/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="246 Pa.

At the time of the motion to disqualify, as well as for a period of approximately 11 months prior to that time, Richard P. Brown, Jr., a partner in the Philadelphia office of the law firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, was counsel of record for Arundel, subcontractor to plaintiff American, and a party in interest in American’s suit against City although not a named plaintiff. Underlying City’s petition were the following allegations: (1) that John P. Bracken, a partner in the Morgan, Lewis and Bockius firm, was an officer, an Executive Committee member, and a Board member of Port Corporation, the instrumentality and agent of the defendant City; (2) that Port Corporation supervised and managed the Tioga Marine Site Terminal project for City, and that it was Port Corporation’s actions in that capacity that formed the subject of the litigation commenced by American; (3) that by virtue of Bracken’s relationship with Port Corporation, he had received certain confidential information regarding the facts of the litigation commenced by American; (4) that City would be relying on the records and testimony of present or former Port Corporation employees in its defense against American’s claims; and (5) that, at the very least, an appearance of impropriety resulted from the simultaneous existence of Bracken’s relationship with an agency of defendant City, and representation of American and Arundel, by Bracken’s law partner.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[185,2255,1153,96]],["BL_314.1",314,[258,305,1155,632]]]'>Stripped of their procedural trappings, and reduced to simplest terms, the questions before us are: (1) whether <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>under the facts of this case, City’s motion to disqualify was timely filed, and if so, (2) whether the Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility bar an attorney from representing the plaintiff in a lawsuit when a partner in that attorney’s law firm holds a position of substantial responsibility as an officer and board member of the defendant. We believe both questions should be answered in the affirmative. We therefore reverse the Superior Court’s order affirming the trial court’s dismissal of City’s motion to disqualify. We also order that Richard P. Brown, Jr., and the law firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius be disqualified from representing Arundel and American in this matter.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[257,956,1154,738]]]'>Initially, Brown and Morgan, Lewis and Bockius argue that City’s motion to disqualify was properly dismissed because untimely filed. In support of this position it is argued that Brown entered his appearance as co-counsel for American on December 2, 1975, at which time City was represented by the City Solicitor’s office; that the City Solicitor was both a Port Corporation Director and member of its executive committee while American’s suit against City was pending, and that, therefore, City knew of the relative positions of Brown, and Bracken, his partner at Morgan, Lewis and Bockius. Because City raised no objection to Brown’s representation of Arundel or his appearance as co-counsel for American until November 22, 1976, Brown and his law firm now contend that such a motion to disqualify is too late.</p>

Alternately, City argues that even if its motion to disqualify was untimely filed, such lack of promptness should not bar City’s motion because a motion for disqualification is in the public interest and courts may not act contrary to that interest by permit<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>ting one party’s delay in moving for disqualification to justify a breach of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>

The trial court in the first instance has the power to regulate the conduct of attorneys practicing before it, and has the duty to insure that those attorneys act in accordance with the Code of Professional Responsibility. No specific rule of court governs the timeliness of a motion to disqualify based on alleged ethical violations of the challenged attorney. The court’s responsibility cannot be defeated by the laches of the party seeking disqualification, at least where the motion to disqualify is made prior to the commencement of trial. <em>Ernie Industries Inc., v.

Similarly, Brown and his firm argue that Canon 5 of the Code of Professional Responsibility — “A <em>Lawyer </em>Should Exercise Independent Professional Judgment on Behalf of a <em>Client </em>” (emphasis added) — applies only in an attorney-client relationship and has not been breached here because neither Port Corporation nor City have ever been Bracken’s client. Lastly, Brown and his firm contend that an alleged breach of Canon <em>9 </em>— “A Lawyer Should Avoid Even the Appearance of Professional Impropriety” — must be judged within the context of specific ethical or disciplinary rules, none of which, it is argued, have been violated by Brown, Bracken, or their firm.</p>

Furthermore, from Port Corporation’s creation to the present, Bracken has been a member of Port Corporation’s Board of Directors, its twelve member Executive Committee, and, until June 30, 1976, was Port Corporation’s Senior Vice President. We also note that Port Corporation is a non-profit corporation, and that the Non-Profit Corporation Law of 1972, 15 Pa.C.S. § 7734 (Supp.1978) provides that officers and directors of non-profit corporations shall be deemed to stand in a fiduciary relationship to the corporation. Bracken’s position as Board member, executive committee member, and senior vice-president certainly imposed upon him a position of trust similar to that contemplated in an attorney-client relationship by Canon 4. Because of this fiduciary relationship with Port Corporation, Bracken himself could not ethically have represented American or Arundel. Canon 4’s admonition that a lawyer should preserve the confidences and secrets of a client is founded in part at least on the fiduciary duty existing between a lawyer and a client.

Bracken is a long-time official of Port Corporation, an agency of defendant City, and a powerful influence on that Corporation. As an officer and member of the board of Port Corporation during the period of time in which the incidents forming the basis of American’s suit occurred, it is likely that he had substantial influence on Port Corporation’s action during that period. As such, Bracken’s interest in the outcome of the litigation is adverse to American’s. Nevertheless, American is represented by Bracken’s law partner. We believe that under the facts of this case, Canon 5 bars Brown, as well as Bracken, from representing Arundel and American.</p>

As both the trial court and the unanimous Superior Court recognized, the controlling question here is whether the City of Philadelphia, aware of the challenged attorney’s participation in this case for at least 22 months before filing its motion to disqualify, can on the eve of trial complain of that attorney’s continued participation; or whether the City may be excused for its delay because it retained new special counsel little more than two months before filing this motion.

While numerous other actions were instituted as a result of this original suit, it is important only to note that Port Corporation has never been a party to American’s action against the City, the action in which this appeal was taken, and neither Mr. Erisman nor the City Solicitor’s office has ever represented Port Corporation in any of the suits.</p>
