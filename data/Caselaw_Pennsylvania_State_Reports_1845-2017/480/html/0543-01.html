Appellant was represented by a member of the Public Defender’s Office of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania during both of those proceedings. A post-conviction petition was filed by appellant and a hearing was held. During this proceeding <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>appellant was represented by another member of the Public Defender’s Office of Allegheny County. Among other allegations, appellant claimed in his post-conviction petition that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel at trial. Post-conviction relief was denied and an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>was filed and granted by this Court. Thereafter post-conviction counsel was permitted to withdraw and an attorney independent of the Public Defender’s Office was appointed to represent appellant in this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Specifically appellant is contending that he was entitled to the aid and advice of independent counsel in pursuing the allegation of ineffective assistance during the post-conviction proceeding below.
