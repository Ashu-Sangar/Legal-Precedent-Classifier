Among the assets of his estate was a mortgage on land in Hartford Township, Trumbell County, Ohio, owned by one Roy Kepner and his wife. The mortgage debt was paid during the course of the administration of the estate, and by their account the executors of Taylor’s will proposed that the proceeds of the mortgage be distributed as part of the residuary estate. Mrs. Dorothy Caldwell, of Buryhill, Ohio, the appellant here, filed exceptions to the account, claiming that she was entitled to the mortgage proceeds. The basis of her claim was that by his will the decedent had made a specific devise of this property to Mrs. Caldwell, and that this provision served to pass the mortgage to her. The court below dismissed Mrs. Caldwell’s exceptions and confirmed the executors’ account absolutely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This appeal was then taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We will affirm.</p>

Among the residuary beneficiaries were Frances Lewis (20%), three sons of the testator (15% to one and 10% to the others), six grandchildren (5% each), a business friend (5%), and two unidentified donees, a Mrs. Jeannie Reiss and a Mrs. Hannah Mary Taylor, each 5%.

The witnesses were the scrivener of the will, who had been the testator’s lawyer, Mrs. Dorothy Caldwell, Mrs. Roy Kepner and the individual executor. At the conclusion of the hearing the auditing judge made factual findings as to the “circumstances surrounding execution of the will and other facts bearing on the question.” <em>Sykes Estate, </em><a href="/pa/477/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="477 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1738246" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0254-01">477 Pa. 254</a>, 257, <a href="/pa/477/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="477 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1738246" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0254-01">383 A.2d 920</a>, 921 (1978). In essence, it was ascertained that in 1960 Roy Kepner and his wife by written agreement gave William B. Taylor the exclusive right to develop real property owned by the Kep<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>ners in Trumbull County, Ohio. The agreement described the Kepners as “owners” and Taylor as “contractor”, and provided that Taylor would receive one-half the sale price of each lot. The development project never materialized, however, due to lack of approval of the local planning board. The agreement was placed of record in December, 1968 (nine months after Mr. Taylor executed his will) when a mortgage foreclosure proceeding was commenced against the property. A month later, in January, 1969, Taylor himself purchased the mortgage from the mortgagee by paying the mortgage debt due by the Kepners. According to his lawyer, who handled the transaction, Taylor was obliged to borrow to accomplish this. It was this mortgage which Taylor owned when he died six months later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The court went on to hold, however, that because the mortgage was acquired after the execution of the will but before the death of the testator, and there had been no republication of the will after the date of acquisition, the mortgage could pass only by a general devise or bequest, such as the residuary clause, and not by a specific devise or bequest such as Paragraph Second of the will.
