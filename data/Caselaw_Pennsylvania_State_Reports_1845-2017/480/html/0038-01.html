Ramsey told Detective Gibbs that Stokes had admitted his participation to him. However, the story was conclusory and contained no detailed description of Stokes’ criminal activity. Moreover, the record is silent as to the circumstances under which Stokes’ admission was made and as to Ramsey’s relationship with Stokes which might have explained why Stokes would have divulged such self-incriminating information to him. But, <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>even assuming that the first requirement of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test was met, the record is clearly deficient in regard to the requirements of the second prong of that test.</p>

Ramsey was not previously known to Sergeant Strohm or Detective Gibbs, and he had never before given information to the police. He did not come forward to report the crime as a disinterested citizen complainant, but, rather, he was sought out by the police more than six weeks after the crime to corroborate a story he had told to Gregory Staulings. Under these circumstances we cannot assume that he had no reason to falsify information or mislead the police.</p>
    <p id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.6",178,[217,1109,1157,687]]]'>Further, the record fails to include facts to support a reasonable belief that Ramsey’s information was reliable. Detective Strohm testified on direct examination that he asked Ramsey “what knowledge he had of the white man that was shot and killed on N. 63rd Street back in July, namely July 1st.” Ramsey responded that “David Stokes had told him that they had shot the white man on 63rd Street when they were out to rob somebody and that the man died.” Thus, the question posed by Detective Strohm partially suggested the answer which Ramsey gave. Therefore, the information cannot be considered reliable on the basis that it independently corroborated information already possessed by the police.</p>
