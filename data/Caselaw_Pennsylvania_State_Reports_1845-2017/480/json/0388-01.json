        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn April 25, 1975, appellant Robert Kowatch, a service station dealer, filed a Complaint in Equity seeking a preliminary injunction prohibiting his petroleum supplier, Atlantic Richfield Company (Arco), from terminating the business relationship between the parties. Kowatch alleged that on May 1, 1974, he and Arco signed a printed form captioned a \u201cService Station Lease,\u201d authorizing Kowatch to operate an Arco service station in Palmerton and stating a one year term of occupancy. Kowatch alleged that his operation of the business was \u201cmore than satisfactory,\u201d complying with all provisions of the \u201cService Station Lease,\u201d except the \u201chours of operation\u201d clause requiring him to operate the station from 6:00 a. m. to 11:00 p. m. Kowatch contended that the national policy of conserving energy and economic realities precluded operation of the station for the seventeen hours per day set forth in the \u201cService Station Lease.\u201d Instead, Kowatch reduced his hours of operation to twelve hours a day, from 9:00 a. m. to 9:00 p. m. According to Kowatch, Arco \u201charassed and demanded\u201d him to adhere to the seventeen hour schedule set forth in the \u201cService Station Lease.\u201d On March 24,1975, Arco mailed Kowatch a \u201cNotice of Default,\u201d demanding payment of a $10.64 penalty, and the next day sent a \u201cNotice of Lease Termination,\u201d effective upon expiration of the term of occupancy stated in the printed form.\nConcluding Arco had an absolute right to recover possession of the service station at the end of the stated term, the trial court sustained Arco\u2019s Preliminary Objections, in which Arco asserted that \u201cthe term of the agreement sued upon has expired.\u201d The trial court dismissed Kowatch\u2019s complaint. The Superior Court affirmed without opinion, and we granted allowance of appeal.\nKowatch contends, as he did in his complaint, that the printed form signed by the parties embodies a franchise agreement Arco could terminate only for \u201cadequate and sufficient cause.\u201d Arco relies upon the trial court\u2019s determination that its status as landlord entitles it to recover possession upon expiration of the term stated in the printed form.\nIn Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Razumic, 480 Pa. 366, 390 A.2d 736 (1978), we held that a printed form \u201cDEALER LEASE\u201d containing provisions requiring a gasoline dealer to operate a petroleum supplier\u2019s service station in a manner reflecting favorably on the supplier\u2019s public image and to display the supplier\u2019s trademarks and products as prescribed by the supplier, and authorizing the supplier to inspect the service station and the dealer\u2019s financial records periodically to assure continued compliance with the terms of the writing, embodied a franchise agreement. We reached this conclusion even though the parties captioned the writing in a manner suggesting a landlord and tenant relationship. The form writing in this case contains provisions substantially identical to the writing in Razumic. Based on Razumic, we agree with Kowatch that the writing he and Arco signed embodies a franchise.\nIn Razumic, the form writing was silent concerning the petroleum supplier\u2019s right to terminate the franchise agreement without cause. After considering the relationship between parties to a contract nearly identical to the present one and their reasonable expectations, we concluded that the supplier owed its dealer an obligation to act in a commercially reasonable manner, which precluded arbitrary termination of the franchise agreement based solely upon expiration of the term of occupancy.\nHere, too, the writing does not expressly provide for Arco\u2019s termination of the franchise agreement without cause. Here, as in Razumic we hold that Arco cannot arbitrarily terminate its franchise agreement with Kowatch.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court affirming the order of the court of common pleas sustaining Arco\u2019s preliminary objections to Kowatch\u2019s complaint and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party pay own costs.\nPACKEL, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1978).\n. In its Preliminary Objections to Kowatch\u2019s complaint, Arco averred that termination was lawful because Kowatch violated the \u201chours of operation\u201d clause. Arco has expressly abandoned this contention.",

The complaint had alleged, however, that ARCO, despite the language of the lease with respect to expiration of the term, had created the understanding \u201cby statements, warranties and ... by the conduct and actions of the said defendant that: the agreements were to be in full force indefinitely . . .
