(Supp. 1978-79). Appellants have raised the following allegations:\n(1) trial counsel was ineffective for advising appellants to plead guilty to second degree murder;\n(2) there was an inadequate factual basis for the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of appellants\u2019 pleas;\n(3) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that the guilty plea colloquy contained an on-the-record explanation of the elements of all crimes charged;\n(4) appellants\u2019 guilty pleas were induced by illegal detention, unlawful arrest, and illegally obtained statements;\n(5) the trial judge improperly participated in the plea bargaining process;\n(6) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a change of venue.\nWe have considered appellants\u2019 contentions and find them to be without merit.\nAffirmed.\nJurisdiction over this appeal is based upon section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1978-79), and section 11 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-11 (Supp. 1978-79).",
