        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Robert Black, was tried before a judge and jury and found guilty of murder of the first degree, robbery and conspiracy in connection with the death of a Philadelphia druggist during an attempted robbery of his drug store. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Represented by new counsel, appellant appealed his conviction to this Court. We affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Black, 464 Pa. 604, 347 A.2d 705 (1975).\nThereafter appellant, again represented by new counsel, filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 to 1180-14 (Supp.1978-79). In his PCHA petition, appellant raised the issue of ineffectiveness of trial counsel (1) in not objecting to allegedly prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor in his closing argument to the jury, and (2) in not requesting a charge on voluntary manslaughter. In addition, appellant alleged that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective in not pursuing a claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel in these two respects. The PCHA court denied relief.\nSince the PCHA court was appellant\u2019s first opportunity to allege ineffective assistance of his counsel on direct appeal, that claim is properly before us. E. g., Commonwealth v. Seachrist, 478 Pa. 621, 387 A.2d 661 (1978); Commonwealth v. Fox, 476 Pa. 475, 383 A.2d 199 (1978); Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975). We agree with appellant that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to certain prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor in his summation, and that counsel on direct appeal was ineffective in not alleging trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in not doing so. We therefore reverse the order of the PCHA court and grant appellant a new trial, and need not address other issues raised by appellant.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s remarks in question are as follows:\n\u201cI say to you, the only way that you could possibly find Robert Black not guilty of murder in the first degree is if Sidney Adelman walked through that door right now.\nThat\u2019s not going to happen. Ask Mrs. Adelman if that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\nThis Court has, on many occasions, condemned the prosecutorial tactic of directing juries\u2019 attention to the rear of the courtroom to wait for the deceased to walk through the door. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Mayberry, 479 Pa. 23, 387 A.2d 815 (1978); Commonwealth v. Evans, 479 Pa. 100, 387 A.2d 854 (1978); Commonwealth v. Gilman, 470 Pa. 179, 368 A.2d 253 (1977); Commonwealth v. Cronin, 464 Pa. 138, 346 A.2d 59 (1975); Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 317 A.2d 205 (1974). Indeed, the prosecutor in the present case, in an effort to inflame the jury, went further than the prosecutors in those cases. This prosecutor suggested that the jury ask the deceased\u2019s wife whether the deceased would be walking through the door, clearly an effort to further impassion the jury.\nThere is no question the above-quoted statements could constitute grounds for a mistrial if they had been objected to by defense counsel. E. g., Commonwealth v. Gilman, supra; Commonwealth v. Cronin, supra; Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, supra. Trial counsel could not have had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate appellant\u2019s interests when he failed to object to those prejudicial and inflammatory remarks. See Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967), and its progeny. No such reasonable basis was proffered by the prosecution at the PCHA hearing, and we can discern none.\nWe must conclude from our review of the record that trial counsel was ineffective in not objecting to these statements in the prosecutor\u2019s summation, and we can discern no reasonable basis for appellate counsel failing to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Evans, supra, and cases cited therein. The order of the post-conviction court is reversed and appellant is granted a new trial.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.",

Evans, 479 Pa. 100, 387 A.2d 854 (1978), and the reasons which prompted my dissent in that case similarly compel a dissent in the case at bar. Id. 479 Pa. at 106-108, 387 A.2d at 857 (dissenting opinion of POMEROY, J., joined by LARSEN, J.). Moreover, while I do not condone the prosecutor\u2019s remark which causes the Court to reverse, I am convinced, upon examination of the assistant district attorney\u2019s argument as a whole and after reviewing the overwhelming evidence presented by the Commonwealth, that the remark in question was beyond a reasonable doubt harmless and that failure to object to it did not constitute constitutional ineffectiveness of defense counsel. In short, I think the post-conviction hearing court properly denied relief and I would affirm its order.",
