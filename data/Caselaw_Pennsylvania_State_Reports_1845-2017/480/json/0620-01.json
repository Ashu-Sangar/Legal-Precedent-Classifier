        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant was convicted of murder in the first degree after a jury trial. In this appeal, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning the weight and sufficiency of lay testimony as to his sanity was erroneous. This contention has been waived. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1119(b). A review of the record also shows that appellant\u2019s other assignments of error are without merit.\nFinally, we have reviewed the record pursuant to our statutory .obligation and have determined that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1978).\n. These allegations are:\n(1) The lay testimony as to appellant\u2019s sanity was insufficient to support the verdict;\n(2) The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury contained reversible error;\n(3) The court erroneously refused to accept appellant\u2019s proposed addition to a supplemental charge requested by the jury;\n(4) The court erred in permitting the prosecution to examine a psychiatric report and in allowing portions of that report to be read to the jury.\n. Act of February 15, 1870, P.L. 15, \u00a7 2, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1187 (1964).",
