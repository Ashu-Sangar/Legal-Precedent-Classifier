        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn 1927, testator Isaac Frank created an irrevocable trust by which he received income for life. At his death, his three children, William K. Frank, Robert J. Frank and Bessie Frank Anathan, were to receive income from the trust for their respective lives. The trust provided that, upon the death of each child, \u201cthe share of the income from the trust fund of the one so dying shall be paid to his surviving wife or her surviving husband\u201d for life or until remarriage. If a child died without a surviving spouse, or upon death or remarriage of the surviving spouse, the trust for that child continued for the benefit of his or her issue, who were to receive income in equal shares per stirpes until termination of the trust. The trust was to end\n\u201cat the decease of my last surviving child, and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried then and thereupon the corpus of this trust estate shall be divided into three equal parts or shares\nThe trust provided that upon termination, the trustees would divide the principal into three equal parts to be distributed as each of testator\u2019s children had appointed or, in default of exercise of the power of appointment or if the child died without issue surviving, to the child\u2019s heirs at law under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nWhen testator created the trust in 1927, his daughter Bessie Frank Anathan was 41 years old. She had married Simon Anathan more than fourteen years previously and bore him two children. Bessie died in 1976. Testator\u2019s second child, William K. Frank, was 36 years old in 1927 and married to Florence K. Frank since 1914. The couple had three children. Florence K. Frank died in 1940. Five years later, William K. Frank married Mary K. Frank, by whom he had one child. William K. Frank died in 1964. Mary K. Frank is now 67 years old. Testator\u2019s third child, Robert J. Frank, was 30 years old in 1927 and married to Cecilia K. Frank for five years. He and Cecilia had two children. Robert J. and Cecilia Frank were divorced in 1951. That same year, Robert J. married Ruth Louise Frank, who remained his wife until her death in 1963. The couple had a son. Robert J. Frank died in 1964.\nRobert J. Frank appointed his share of the trust to his children, Alan, Joan and Barbara. William K. Frank declined to exercise his power of appointment if the trust terminated before his wife Mary\u2019s death or remarriage but, if the trust ended at her death or remarriage, appointed to his surviving issue. Bessie Frank Anathan appointed her share to her issue living at the time of distribution.\nUpon the death of Bessie Frank Anathan in 1976, the trustees petitioned the orphans\u2019 court for distribution. Appellants, Barbara Frank Dane, Joan Frank Apt and Alan Frank, children of Robert J. Frank, argued to the auditing judge that the trust was intended to terminate upon Bessie\u2019s death because she was testator\u2019s last surviving child. Their position was that under the provision terminating the trust \u201cat the decease of my last surviving child, and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried . . ., only individuals married to testator\u2019s children at the time of execution of the trust could be a daughter- or son-in-law. Because all those individuals had died by 1971, appellants asserted that the trust ended in 1976 when Bessie died. Appellees Mary K. Frank and her daughter Maude, argued that Mary was a daughter-in-law of testator and that consequently the trust could not terminate until she either died or remarried. The auditing judge determined that Mary K. Frank was a daughter-in-law and that therefore the trust had not terminated. The orphans\u2019 court en banc, equally divided, affirmed the determination of the auditing judge. The only question on this appeal is whether Mary K. Frank is a \u201cdaughter-in-law\u201d within the terms of the termination clause of the trust. We hold that she is a \u201cdaughter-in-iaw\u201d and affirm.\nIn McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, 479 Pa. 300, 304-305, 388 A.2d 666, 668 (1978), this Court again announced:\n\u201cAs in any matter involving interpretation of a [trust], the intent of the testator, if it can be ascertained, must prevail. Estate of Sykes, 477 Pa. 254, 383 A.2d 920 (1978); Blough Estate, 474 Pa. 177, 378 A.2d 276 (1977); Hamilton Estate, 454 Pa. 495, 312 A.2d 373 (1973). To determine this intent, \u2018a court examines the words of the instrument and, if necessary, the scheme of distribution, the circumstances surrounding execution of the will and other facts bearing on the question.\u2019 Estate of Sykes, 477 Pa. at 257, 383 A.2d at 921; accord, Hamilton Estate, supra; Chambers Estate, 438 Pa. 22, 263 A.2d 746 (1970). This intent \u2018must appear with reasonable certainty, such that there can be little doubt of his intent.\u2019 Estate of Sykes, supra. Only when the intent does not appear with reasonable certainty will a court resort to rules of construction. Id.\u201d\nAccord, Flinn Estate, 479 Pa. 312, 388 A.2d 672 (1978); Schappell Estate, 424 Pa. 390, 227 A.2d 651 (1967); Houston Estate, 414 Pa. 579, 201 A.2d 592 (1964).\nNeither the language of the instrument nor the scheme of distribution demonstrates testator\u2019s intent with reasonable certainty. Appellants argue that in the provision terminating the trust, the words \u201cboth\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d in the phrase \u201cboth my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law\u201d indicate that testator had in mind only those personally known to him. This conclusion is unjustified. Most likely, \u201cboth\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d seemed to testator a convenient way to refer to the wives of his two sons, whoever they would be when testator\u2019s children died.\nTestator directed that upon the death of each child, his or her share of income would pass to \u201chis surviving wife or her surviving husband,\u201d but did not use the possessives \u201chis\u201d or \u201cher\u201d and \u201csurviving\u201d in the termination clause. From this variation in wording, appellants conclude that only in the former provision did testator intend to include possible future in-laws. We agree with the auditing judge that no such intent can be derived from the difference in & wording.\nSurrounding circumstances also fail to reveal testator\u2019s intent with reasonable certainty. Appellants argue that testator intended to exclude a future daughter-in-law \u201cin view of the ages and long standing family circumstances of his children and generally accepted social standards of that time,\u201d and \u201cprobably did not envision a divorce by any of his children or the remarriage of a child after divorce or the death of his own spouse.\u201d Appellants have offered no evidence to support their assertions regarding \u201cgenerally accepted social standards of that time,\u201d and we refuse to take judicial notice of a fact far from established as incontestable or a matter of common knowledge. Commonwealth ex rel. Duff v. Keenan, 347 Pa. 574, 33 A.2d 244 (1943). Moreover, the circumstances of testator\u2019s life and family contradict appellant\u2019s conclusion. In 1927, all of testator\u2019s children were under 42 years of age and had been married no longer than 14 years. Robert J. Frank had been married just five years. Thus, appellants err in describing the family circumstances as so long standing and established that testator could not \u201cenvision\u201d changes within his childrens\u2019 families, including death, divorce and remarriage.\nAppellants further argue that testator\u2019s scheme of distribution was to vest remainder interests in his grandchildren at the earliest possible time, which would be thwarted by the view that Mary K. Frank was a daughter-in-law for purposes of the termination clause. On the contrary, the scheme of distribution does not appear designed to vest remainder interests of grandchildren to the exclusion of other interests created in the instrument. The trust creates interests for both testator\u2019s children and their spouses and for grandchildren, but does not indicate that one is to have preference over the other. Appellants\u2019 argument simply substitutes as a conclusion their desire to take remainder interests as of 1976 rather than at a later time.\nWe cannot conclude that testator\u2019s intent appears with reasonable certainty. We therefore resort to a canon of construction to supply testator\u2019s likely intent.\nWe recently reaffirmed that \u201cwhere a testator employs a class designation, his intent is to include not only those known to him but all that may come into the class described unless there is some contrary intent manifested.\u201d McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, 479 Pa. at 306, 388 A.2d at 669 (quotation marks omitted) (bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d included children adopted after execution of instrument); accord, Earle Estate, 369 Pa. 52, 85 A.2d 90 (1951) (bequest to male children of testator\u2019s sons bearing family named included grandsons born after testator\u2019s death); Wanamaker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 241, 6 A.2d 852 (1939) (bequest to \u201cgrandchildren\u201d included those born after testator\u2019s death). Testator did not refer by name to particular daughters-in-law in the termination clause; nor did he otherwise describe them so they could be identified as though specifically named. Rather, he used a class designation. Because no intent to the contrary exists in the trust, we construe the termination clause to include Mary K. Frank, who, after execution of the trust, became a daughter-in-law of testator and stood in that relation to him.\nAppellants argue that this canon of construction produces a violation of the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, which voids interests where a possibility exists that they will not vest until more than twenty-one years after lives in being at the creation of the interest. McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, supra (citing cases). Thus, appellants argue that the possibility existed that, if any of testator\u2019s children remarried, the second spouse would have been born after creation of the trust in 1927, and that, if the trust continued during the life of the second spouse, the gift in default of appointment to the heirs of Bessie Frank Anathan, to be determined at termination of the trust, would occur later than twenty-one years after lives in being. Appellants therefore contend that, to save the trust from a violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities, we must interpret the termination clause to exclude in-laws not married to testator\u2019s children at the time of creation of the trust. See Farrington Will, 422 Pa. 164, 220 A.2d 790 (1966) (instrument should be construed, if possible, to give it legal effect).\nOur interpretation, however, does not cause the trust to run afoul of the Rule. Although we have never applied the Rule to gifts in default of appointment, the better view is that the common law contains an actual events test for such gifts. That is, compliance with the Rule is determined according to actual events rather than by possibilities. Restatement 2d of Property, \u00a7 1.4 (comment i) (Tentative Draft, 1978); 6 American Law of Property \u00a7\u00a7 24.35, 24.36 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952); cf. Warren\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 112, 182 A. 396 (1936) (gift by appointment). Thus, testator\u2019s trust is subject to the actual events test, not the possibilities test.\nUnder the actual events test, Mary K. Frank was a life in being when testator created the trust. No interest can vest later than twenty-one years past her life because the last interests to vest do so upon either her death or remarriage. Thus, construction of the trust\u2019s termination clause to include Mary K. Frank as a \u201cdaughter-in-law\u201d presents no violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities. See Pearson Estate, supra.\nAppellants argue in the alternative that, because testator provided for three independent per stirpital lines of distribution, and all income and principal interests have vested in two of the per stirpital lines, the trust as to those lines should be terminated. This conclusion would allow appellants to receive their interests in the principal even though the trust would continue for the benefit of Mary K. Frank and the children of William K. Frank. Partial termination of a trust, however, is permitted only where the testator has not expressed an intent that the trust remain intact. Card\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 69, 9 A.2d 552 (1939). Here, testator clearly specified that the trust would end only at the decease or remarriage of all his daughters- and son-in-law. When testator has designated the time at which the trust will terminate, this Court must respect that instruction.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nAPPENDIX\nPOMEROY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nEAGEN, C.

When the testator, Isaac Frank, wrote that the trust shall terminate \u201cat the decease of my last surviving child and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried,\u201d he intended that the trust should terminate at the death of the survivor of his three children and their spouses known to him. The natural construction of \u201cboth my daughters-in-law\u201d would refer to the two daughters-in-law then married to testator\u2019s sons. The majority\u2019s construction, including daughters-in-law unknown to testator, is unnatural and strained.\nThe income of the trust is currently distributed one-third to Bessie Frank Anathan\u2019s children, one-third to Ralph J. Frank\u2019s children, and one-third to Mary K. Frank (William\u2019s second spouse). If the trust is considered terminated, the corpus distribution would be the same except that Mary K. would get one-ninth of the corpus and William\u2019s children would get two-ninths. However, under the majority\u2019s holding the trust will not terminate until the death of Mary K., when the corpus will be distributed as follows: one-third to Bessie\u2019s children, one-third to Robert Frank\u2019s children, and because William did not exercise his power of appointment, one third to the intestate heirs of William. Thus, if the children of William predecease Mary K., which is a very real possibility since Mary K. is only six years older than William\u2019s eldest son, then one or more of the children of William will never receive any benefit whatsoever from the trust. This plan thwarts the testator\u2019s intent: the trust instrument indicates a definite intent to benefit the testator\u2019s grandchildren. The children of William are members of the class of grandchildren, and the testator did not intend to postpone the distribution of the corpus of the trust until the death of a much younger daughter-in-law unknown to him.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. Our duty in this case is to determine and apply the intent of the settlor as to when the\u2019trust is to terminate. The issue is the meaning of the words used in the termination clause, providing the trust would terminate \u201cat the decease of my last surviving child, and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe majority claims that the testator\u2019s intent cannot be discerned with reasonable certainty and, therefore, they \u201cconstrue the termination clause to include Mary K. Frank, who, after execution of the trust, became a daughter-in-law of testator and stood in that relation to him.\u201d (at 124) The fact of the matter is that Mary K. Frank never \u201cstood in that relation\u201d to Isaac Frank. How can one be considered a daughter-in-law of a man who had died 15 years prior to the marriage? I do not believe that Isaac Frank considered, in 1927, that a possible future spouse of one of his children, who might remarry after his (Isaac\u2019s) death, would be construed as his \u201cin-law\u201d. As aptly stated by the dissenting opinion of Judge J. Frank McKenna, joined by Judge Paul Zavarella, in the court below, \u201c[t]o construe the words \u2018both\u2019 as referring to daughters-in-law, known and unknown, on the one hand, and son-in-law on the other, would result in a strained and unnatural construction and one which we believe testator never intended.\u201d\nI find other portions of the trust instrument illuminating in the quest for Isaac Frank\u2019s intent, which I find can be determined with reasonable certainty. First, a reading of the instrument reveals that, with respect to income interests, Isaac used the phrase \u201chis [referring to his sons\u2019] wife or her surviving husband,\u201d which is significantly different terminology from \u201cboth my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law,\u201d the phrase employed by Isaac to describe those persons whose death or remarriage would trigger the termination of the trust. Obviously, he was aware of the distinction. A logical explanation of the distinction is that the settlor intended his children\u2019s spouses, whoever they might be, to share in the income of the trust until their death or remarriage, but not at the expense of unduly delaying the vesting in enjoyment and possession of the gifts over to his grandchildren. Thus, in the termination clause, he referred, albeit not by name, to six designated individuals \u2014 his two sons and \u201cboth of my daughters-in-law,\u201d and his daughter and \u201cmy son-in-law.\u201d\nSecond, other portions of the instrument indicate that Isaac was familiar with and sensitive to the limitations on future gifts to his grandchildren imposed by the rule against perpetuities. Historically, a well-known perpetuities problem is the classic case of the unborn-widow of a child of a settlor or testator. Leach, Perpetuities in a Nutshell, 51 Har.L.Rev. 638, 644 (1938). Thus, where the settlor makes a gift in trust \u201cto my son A, for life, then to his wife if surviving, for her life, then to their children,\u201d the son could marry a woman not in being at the time the trust is created; the gift to the children of A would, therefore, be void under the common law rule against perpetuities because of the possibility that their interests would not vest until more than 21 years after lives-in-being at the creation of the future interest (the son could predecease the \u201cunborn widow\u201d who could survive him by more than 21 years). Since Isaac Frank, concerned as he was with the rule against perpetuities, would not desire this result, his reference to \u201cboth his daughters-in-law and my son-in-law\u201d was a reference to those daughters-in-law and the son-in-law existing at the time he created the trust.\nThe majority answers this argument by applying the \u201cactual events\u201d test, adopted by our legislature in 1948, to the gifts to the grandchildren, concluding that, because actual events have disclosed that Mary K. Frank was, in fact, a life-in-being when the trust was created, and because no interest could vest beyond 21 years after either her death or remarriage, \u201cconstruction of the trust\u2019s termination clause to include Mary K. Frank as a \u2018daughter-in-law\u2019 presents no violation of the rule against perpetuities.\u201d (at 125) The difficulty with this analysis is that it treats the issue as solely a determination of the validity of the grandchildren\u2019s remainder interest. This is not the issue. We are here concerned with Isaac Frank\u2019s intent at the time he created the trust, in 1927.\nAt the time he executed the trust agreement, the settlor necessarily had to be concerned with possibilities, since it would require a fortune-teller to know, in 1927, events that would transpire in 1945. The use of a hindsight analysis to determine the present validity of the interests created is of no consequence in the search for Isaac\u2019s intent, especially since, in 1927, the common law rule against perpetuities prevailed. Thus, the settlor would have had to be clairvoyant not only as regards his children\u2019s future relationships, but also as regards the actions of the legislature in adopting the \u201cactual events\u201d test (alternatively referred to as the \u201csecond look\u201d doctrine or the \u201cwait. and see\u201d approach).\nTherefore, I find that Isaac Frank did not intend to create future interests in his grandchildren which, when the trust was created, were in violation of the rule against perpetuities as it was then applied in this Commonwealth. Consequently, he referred in the termination clause to six \u201clives-in-being,\u201d his three children and his three in-laws then existing. Under this interpretation, Mary K. Frank is excluded from the termination clause and the trust, therefore, terminated when Bessie Frank Anathan, the last of those six individuals, died in 1976.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Order of the court below and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. The trust agreement states, in relevant portion: \u201cAt the time when this trust would otherwise cease as herein directed, the majority of my surviving grandchildren may elect that it continue for any term as is not inconsistent with the law of Pennsylvania against perpetuities ...\u201d",
