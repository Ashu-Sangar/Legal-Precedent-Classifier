        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial. Plaintiff sued the defendant, Bar-net E. Shear, in trespass to recover for injuries sustained as a result'of an automobile collision at the intersection of 15th Street and Susquehanna Avenue, Philadelphia, on August 8, 1.942. The automobile in which plaintiff was a passenger was operated by her husband, Leonard Peters.- The defendant brought the plaintiff\u2019s husband on the record as an additional defendant. At the trial the latter was called\u2018as a witness for his wife,' the plaintiff. His testimony related to the occurrence of the accident. Over objection he was then cross-examined by his own attorney who (so it is stated) was also the attorney for the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier. The first and second assignments of error are based upon the court\u2019s, overruling plaintiff\u2019s objection to permitting-the attorney for the added defendant to cross-examine his own client when called by the plaintiff as her witness.\nThe additional defendant testified in chief. that the defendant\u2019s car was thirty to forty feet away when he first saw it, His counsel, in his cross-examination, asked him whether he had discussed the case with anyone;, he replied: .\u201cI have discussed it with Mrs. Peters\u201d, and he added that he was in.the office of Mr. Sacks (Mrs. Peters!attorney) \u201cthis morning\u201d and that he \u201chad a discussion coming over here this morning with Mr., Sacks\u201d. The cross-examiner then produced a statement which \u25a0the witness had signed, declaring that he had never seen the Shear car until the collision. Counsel for the appellant argues \u201cit is common sense that no jury would believe that a man would change his testimony without urging by others whose interests were affected. It appears to counsel for the plaintiff that Mr. Harvey\u2019s (Mr. Peter\u2019s attorney) interest and the plaintiff\u2019s interest were almost identical and that if Mr. Harvey had anything inimical to either interest, he should have so advised plhintiff\u2019s attorney, who would have been guided accordingly. Certainly producing such a statement' at the second trial was a surprise and shock to the plaintiff and her counsel. It appeared to counsel for the plaintiff that Mr. Harvey was laying the ground for the insurance carrier to disclaim in case of a verdict against Leonard Peters for his failure to cooperate with them.\u201d\nCounsel- for- the additional defendant says that he \u201cdid not attack his client at any time, but :only elicited information which unquestionably reacted to the advantage of his client, just as did counsel for the defendant in Conley et al. v. Mervis, 321 Pa. 577, 188 A. 350, when he elicited from his client on cross-examination information which explained away damaging testimony Avhich the client had given during examination-in-chief by counsel for the plaintiff.\u201d\nThe Court said when Mr. Sacks objected to attorney Harvey\u2019s cross-examination of the witness (his own client): \u201cYou called him as your witness, didn\u2019t you?\u201d and- the answer was \u201cyes\u201d. The implication was that Avhen an attorney makes anyone his witness he takes the chance that the witness will be cross-examined by any attorney representing an adverse interest. It may be true as plaintiff\u2019s counsel argues, that in fact the additional defendant\u2019s interest and the plaintiff\u2019s interest \u201cwere almost identical\u201d, but as far as the record disclosed, their interests were at least possibly adverse. When the defendant brought the additional defendant on the record the former averred that the latter \u201cis liable to the plaintiff or is jointly and severally liable with the defendant, or liable over to the defendant for the 'cause of action declared upon in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim.\u201d\nIt is elementary that.\u201cA party is entitled [on cross-examination] to bring out every circumstance relating to a fact which an adverse witness is called to prove\u201d: Bank v. Fordyce, 9 Pa. 275. When Peters was called by the plaintiff as a witness, it followed that he would be subjected to cross-examination by the respective attorneys for the defendant and the additional defendant. Even if plaintiff had called Peters as \u201can adverse party as upon cross-examination,\u201d plaintiff would have been concluded by his testimony, if uncontradicted, and this is true not only as to his own testimony as developed by the party who called him, \u201cbut also [as to] statements then elicited by his own counsel which are merely explanatory of such testimony.\u201d See Readshaw et ux. v. Montgomery, 313 Pa. 206, 209, 169 A. 135.\nThere is nothing unusual in permitting counsel to cross-examine his own client when that client is called as a witness by the adverse party. See Stratton Massachusetts Gold Mines Co. v. Stratton, 206 Mass. 117, 92 N. E. 34; Teel v. Byrne, 24 N. J. Law 631; Jasper v. Bicknell, 191 P. 115. 70 Corpus Juris, sec. 780, p. 613, makes this statement: \u201cWhere a party calls the adverse party as a witness, the latter may be cross-examined by his own counsel or by a codefendant.\u201d\nWhether or not a litigant might feel aggrieved by his attorney eliciting from him when he was on the witness stand the fact that he had \u201cchanged his testimony\u201d is not the question before us. We are concerned only as to whether the court committed error in overruling plaintiff\u2019s objection to the cross-examination of the additional defendant by the latter\u2019s counsel. We find no error in this. The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\nThe third assignment of error is based upon the court\u2019s saying \u201cHe does not have to take the stand\u201d, when counsel for the plaintiff, in his argument told the jury that the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand could be interpreted against him. The fourth assignment is based on the court\u2019s saying in its charge that \u201cthe defendant is not obliged to take the stand in his own behalf. If you are sued by an individual or person in a case of this kind, he has to prove your negligence, and you do not have to go on the stand to disprove anything.\u201d\nThese two assignments of error are sustained. Counsel had a right to argue to the jury that the defendant\u2019s failure to take tlie stand supported an inference adverse to Ms defense. TMs court said in Dommes v. Zuroski, 350 Pa. 206, 38 A. 2d 73, that the instruction given, by the court below in that case that the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand was \u201ca circumstance\u201d that the jury could \u201ctake into consideration in deciding what is the truth in the controversy\u201d was proper. In Hall et al. v. Vanderpool, 156 Pa. 152, this court, speaking through Justice Mitchell, said: \u201cWhere evidence which would properly be part of a case is within the control of the party whose interest it would naturally be to produce it, and, without satisfactory evidence, he fails to do so, the jury may draw an inference that it would be unfavorable to him. It is an inference of fact; not a presumption of law.\u201d This was quoted with approval by Judge Rice in Ginder v. Bachman, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 405. In Arnold v. McKelvey, 253 Pa. 324, this court held in a negligence case: \u201cthat reference by the counsel for the plaintiff in his closing address to the jury to the fact that the defendant\u2019s chauffeur, who was in the court room and had been identified during the trial, had not been called as a witness in the defendant\u2019s behalf was within the limit of reasonable comment by counsel.\u201d\nIt is only in criminal cases that a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand cannot be commented on either by the court or by counsel. See Com. v. Green, 233 Pa. 291, 82 A. 250, and Wigmore on Evidence, 3 ed., vol. 8, sec. 2272. In Com. v. Brown, 309 Pa. 515, 164 A. 726, we discussed the right of counsel to urge jurors to accept as reasonable the inferences which they respectively press upon them from the facts in the case. The third and fourth assignments of error are sustained.\nAppellant also complains that the court in its charge told the jury that \u201ca driver need not anticipate that another driver will be negligent.\u201d Plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in not reducing his speed when he came to the intersection even though he did have \u201cthe right of way.\u201d There is no rule that one having the right of way at an intersection must under all circumstances reduce his speed as he approaches the intersection; neither is there anything in the law which warrants a driver who at an intersection has \u201cthe right of way\u201d proceeding across the intersection regardless of surrounding circumstances. A \u201cright of way\u201d possessed by a motorist is, like a \u201cgreen light,\u201d not a command to proceed but a qualified permission to do so. There may be circumstances which makes proceeding by any motorist across the intersection at a certain speed or at any speed negligent, and a motorist, regardless of his possessing a theoretical \u201cright of way,\u201d must exercise such due care as is required by the situation confronting him. Judge Hirt, speaking for the Superior Court in Hess v. Mumma et al., 144 Pa. Superior Ct. 313, has well expressed, the true rule on this subject, as follows: \u201cThe duty is imposed upon a driver to look for cross traffic at an intersection so that he may take heed from what his senses warn him. It is therefore, of no controlling importance that defendant driver may have been negligent, though first in the intersection, or that plaintiff had the technical right of way over defendants\u2019 truck approaching from his left. \u2018Every person driving on a public highway even though he may have the right of way, must use reasonable care through the exercise of his senses to prevent his own injury and if he fails to do so the consequences must fall upon him, although the negligent act of another caused his injuries\u2019: Stengel v. McMahon, 116 Pa. Superior Ct. 349, 176 A. 857.\u201d\nThe sentence above quoted from the charge of the court below is a generality which might easily mislead a jury to believe that one possessing the \u201cright of way\u201d across an intersection is entitled to proceed regardless of circumstances. A prudent driver takes into consideration all possibilities of danger in any situation confronting him \u2014 and that includes the danger of the \u201cother fellow\u201d doing the wrong thing instead of the right thing. It is the duty of every driver to be prudent to the end that the lives and bodily well-being of all persons wbo may be affected by either his acts or his inattentiveness in driving shall not be destroyed or ipiperiled.\nThe judgment is reversed and \u00bf new trial ordered..",
