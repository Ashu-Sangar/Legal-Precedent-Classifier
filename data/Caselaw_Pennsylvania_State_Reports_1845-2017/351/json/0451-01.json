        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the order of the court below-dismissing the exceptions filed to the order of that court dismissing the petition for a contest for the office of Commissioner for the Third Ward in Shaler Township, Allegheny County.\nThe Return Board made the following return:\nEdward T. Bauman, Jr.......122 votes\nElmer Mertz................ 121 votes\nIt is argued by the contestants, 24 citizens and qualified electors of the Third Ward, that ballots marked Exhibits \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d, respectively, were improperly rejected by the Return Board. Exhibit \u201c1\u201d was excluded as an improper ballot because in addition to the crosses on it there also appeared on it two \u201ccheck marks\u201d after the crosses and another slight mark in the square which is to the right of the name of Elmer Mertz as the Republican candidate for Township Commissioner. This latter was a vertical mark, less than one-eighth of an inch in length, in front of the cross. This mark apparently made inadvertently by the voter, clearly does not invalidate his vote for Mertz. In the party square to the right of the word \u201cRepublican\u201d there is a cross which indicates that the voter wished to vote for the Republican candidates for all the offices named on the ballot. Whatever mark this voter placed in the square to the right of Mertz\u2019s name was mere surplusage and nugatory. The fact that the voter made both a cross and a check mark after the name of the Democratic candidate for Judge of Election and after the name of the Republican candidate for Constable and the fact that he wrote \u201cNo good\u201d after the name of one of the Democratic candidates for School Director does not invalidate the entire ballot. The provision in sub-section (a) of sec. 1223 (Art. 12) of the Act of June 3,1937, P. L. 1333 (25 P.S. 3063), that \u201cNo ballot which is so marked as to be capable of identification shall be counted\u201d must be construed with great liberality, for if every ballot which carried upon it some distinctive mark should be invalidated, there is scarcely any limit to the number of ballots which could be rejected for this reason. Eor example, the same act provided that a voter may \u201cindicate a vote for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot, by writing, stamping or sticker. . . .\u201d By availing himself of this privilege any voter could easily put an \u201cidentification\u201d on his ballot. Either the name of the person voted for, or the writing, stamping or sticker might be such and so placed that no other ballot in the box would carry its duplicate. He might also make an identifying \u201cerasure or mutilation in the vote in any office block\u201d without invalidating the ballot except for the candidates in that block. He might also \u201cmark his ballot for more persons for an office than there are candidates to be voted for for such office\u201d without invalidating his ballot except as to the candidates for such office. All'these would be obvious means of making the ballot \u201ccapable of identification\u201d, yet, under the very provisions of the act the ballot in its entirety would not be void. Many ballots contain smudges or are torn in certain ways. These might possibly be identifying marks but ballots so smudged or torn, are not to be rejected simply because of that possibility. When the voter wrote the words \u201cNo good\u201d after the name of one of the Democratic, candidates for School Director, his apparent idea was not to have his ballot bear an identifying phrase but to show that he not only voted-against that candidate but also that he was unwilling to recognize that there was any \u201cgood\u201d in him. While the expression on official ballots of such excess of personal feelings is not to be encouraged, we think it would be unjust to deprive \u25a0 Elmer Mertz as a candidate for Township Commissioner of the vote the marker of this ballot so unmistakably cast for him. This court said in McCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, 337 Pa. 552, 559: \u201c. . . not every mark which may separate and distinguish a ballot will necessarily result in a declaration of invalidity, but only such marks as cannot be reasonably supposed to have been made by the voter except for the very purpose of distinguishing his ballot. ... ..\u201d\nExhibit No. 1 contains no marks which can be \u201creasonably supposed\u201d to have been made by the voter for the purpose of distinguishing his ballot, and it would be unjust not to count the vote given by that ballot for Elmer Mertz for the office indicated. Election' officers would have enough power , to change in many instances the \u00edesult of an election if they were permitted to throw out every ballot which contained marks which were not contained on any other ballot. The power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities, like the power to throw out the entire poll of an election district for irregularities, must be exercised very sparingly and with the idea in mind that either an individual voter or a group of voters are not to be disfranchised at an election except for compelling reasons. In Ayre\u2019s Contested Election, 287 Pa. 135, 138, 135 A. 477, this court said.: \u201cTo warrant throwing out the vote of an entire district the disregard of the law must be so fundamental as to render it impossible to separate the lawful from the. unlawful votes. See opinion by Judge Thayer in Daly v. Peteroff, 10 Phila. 389\u201d. In Carbondale\u2019s Election, 280 Pa. 159, 124 A. 298, this court sustained the action of the lower court in refusing to \u201cthrow out the entire district\u201d because of certain irregularities on the part of the election officers. This court in its opinion emphasized' the fact that \u201cthe purpose in holding elections is to register the actual expression of the electorate\u2019s will\u201d and that \u201ccomputing judges\u201d should endeavor \u201cto see what was the true result\u201d. There should be the same reluctance to throw out a single ballot as there-is to -throw out an entire district poll, for sometimes an election hinges on one vote. We decide that Exhibit No. 1 contains a valid vote for Elmer Mertz for the office of Commissioner for the Third Ward in Shaler Township, Allegheny County, and it should be counted for him.\nAs to Exhibit No. 2, the voter instead of making his cross with only two diagonal lines crossing each other in the center, made in addition thereto a third and parallel line from the left of the square to the right,, passing about one-sixteenth of an inch below the center of the properly crossed, diagonal lines. The voter, thus indicated his choice by a proper X and then added the meaningless line. We do not think the mark described made the ballot void as being in contravention of the.provision in section 1223 (a) supra, which reads as follows: \u201cAny ballot marked by any other mark, than an .(X) in the spaces provided for that purpose shall be void and not counted: Provided, however, that no vote recorded thereon shall be declared void because a cross (X) mark thereon is irregular in form.\u201d This provision obviously means that if a voter uses any other mark than an X to indicate his choice, that \u201cvote\u201d shall not be counted. For example, if he drew an \u201carrow\u201d or a \u201chand\u201d in the square instead of a cross, it could not be counted as a vote. That this construction of the provision quoted is the one customarily adopted is indicated by the printed instructions on the ballot used in this case, which, inter alia, read as follows: \u201cA cross (X), not a check mark or any other mark, in the square opposite the name of any candidate indicates a vote for that candidate.\u201d But if a voter makes a cross in the square, as this voter did, he has in fact voted even though the cross he made is \u201cirregular in form\u201d, as this one was because of the extra line. If, for example, this voter had made his X out of two double oblique lines crossing each other the \u201ccross\u201d would be \u201cirregular in form\u201d but it would not be void. A voting cross made in the proper square by a voter does not have to be made of only two perfectly straight oblique-lines crossing each other at the exact center. Marking a ballot in voting is a matter not of precision engineering but of an unmistakable registration of the voter\u2019s will in substantial conformity to statutory requirements. See Pfaff v. Bacon, 249 Pa. 297, 95 A. 71. Since the questioned symbol the voter made in the appropriate square on Exhibit \u201c2\u201d is patently recognizable as a voting cross for Elmer Mertz for the office indicated, it should be counted.\nThe Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, Article 14, Sec. 1407, 25 P.S. 3157, provides, inter alia: \u201cNo appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the Court of Common Pleas made in pursuance of this section.\u201d This same provision was contained in the Act of July 9, 1919, 'P. L. 839. In interpreting this provision, in Twenty-Eighth Congressional District Nomination, 268 Pa. 313, 321, 112 A. 74, this court said: \u201cThis, however, does not affect our right to issue a certiorari in order to determine, from an inspection of the record, whether or not the court below exceeded its jurisdiction : (Carpenter\u2019s Case, 14 Pa. 486; Com. v. Balph, 111 Pa. 365; Com. v. Smith, 185 Pa. 553), and for this purpose to examine the opinion of the court in order to discover the reasons for its action: Nomination Certificate of John S. Robb, Sr., 188 Pa. 212; Cramer\u2019s Election Case, 248 Pa. 208.\u201d In Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 293 Pa. 1, 6, 141 A. 633, we said: \u201cIn legal effect this is really \u2018but a certiorari, and on such an appeal judicial review is restricted to the regularity of the record, though in this class of cases . . . findings of fact, contained in the opinion of the court below, may be considered so far as they concern fundamental questions\u2019: Smith\u2019s Petition, 292 Pa. 140; Independence Party Nomination, 208 Pa. 108.\u201d See also Foy\u2019s Election, 228 Pa. 14, 76 A. 713.\nThe order of the Court below which declared Edward T. Bauman, Jr., elected to the office of Commissioner in the Third Ward in Shaler Township is reversed, and it is ordered that a certificate of election be issued to Elmer Mertz for that office.

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Deew:\nI would not reverse the court below, but would affirm its decision, because it is my opinion that it committed no error in excluding the two disputed ballots.\nAt the municipal election of November 2,1943, there was to be filled the office of Township Commissioner for the Third Ward of Shaler Township, Allegheny County, the nominees for which were Edward T. Bauman, Jr., Democrat, and Elmer J. Mertz, Republican. One hundred twenty-one votes were cast for each of these nominees, but the election board rejected two ballots (marked for identification Exhibits \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d) for Mertz, among others. During the period that the returns were being tabulated by the return board, a soldier ballot was received and credited to Bauman, thus making his total vote 122. A petition was filed in the court of common pleas and the ballots in the box were recounted. The recount board also rejected the two ballots, and Bauman was declared elected. An election contest was then filed in the'common pleas court by twenty-four citizens and qualified electors and, after hearing, this was dismissed. A final order dismissing exceptions was filed and this appeal followed.\nI think a careful examination of the disputed ballots shows that both should be rejected, because the markings on each violate specific provisions of the Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333. Article XII, \u00a71223 of that statute provides, inter alia: \u201c(a) No ballot which is so marked as to be capable of identification shall be counted. . . . Any ballot marked by any other-mark th\u00e1n an (X) in the spaces provided for that purpose shall be void and not counted: Provided, however; That no vote recorded thereon shall be declared void because a cross (X) mark thereon is irregular in form. Any erasure, mutilation or defective marking of the straight party column at November elections shall render the entire ballot void, unless the voter had properly indicated his choice for candidates in any office block, in which case the vote or votes for such candidates only shall be counted. Any erasure or mutilation in the vote in any office block shall render void the vote for any candidates in said block, but shall not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, if otherwise properly marked. ...\u201d\n' The ballot, Exhibit \u201c1\u201d, contains the following incorrect markings: (a) a figure consisting of three intersecting lines in the straight party column; (b) the words \u201cno good\u201d written in the School Director block, dpposite the name of Bernard F. Hahn; (c) the adding of check marks to the crosses placed in the spaces provided in the Constable block, opposite the name of Norman Byerley, and in the Judge of Election block, opposite the name Of Jacob P. Burkhart, Jr.; and (d) the insertion of a small vertical line to the left of the cross-mark in the Township Commissioner block, opposite the name of Elmer Mertz.\nThe validity of the other ballot, Exhibit \u201c2\u201d, is attacked on the ground that opposite the names of the various candidates in eight separate blocks there were placed identical marks, which identified the ballot, each consisting of two intersecting diagonal lines with a horizontal line drawn across the diagonal ones at or about the point where they intersect.\n\u25a0 \u25a0 The three-line figure in the straight party column on Exhibit \u201c1\u201d clearly is a defective marking, within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Election Code. Therefore, the insertion' of this figure voids the ballot, at least so far as the vote for Township Commissioner is concerned, sinc\u00e9 the voter thereof did not properly indicate his choice for a candidate in the block for that office. In my judgment, the other marks on the ballots disqualify them, if for no other reason than that the markings thereon make them capable of identification.\nI do not agree with the majority that the legislature intended that the provision' of the Pennsylvania Election Code that \u201cNo ballot which is so marked as to be capable of identification shall be counted\u201d must be construed \u201cwith great liberality\u201d. On the contrary, I think it was clearly intended that this provision of the statute should be reasonably interpreted, in order to protect the secrecy of the ballot, which was recognized to be of supreme importance. : :\nIt is my opinion that both ballots should also be excluded because they contain marks other than \u201can (X) \u201d'. While the cross may be \u201cirregular in form\u201d, and need not be made with any degree of mathematical precision, nevertheless in order to be a cross it must be formed by two intersecting lines. That is the only mark sanctioned by the Pennsylvania Election Code. The use of such a mark insures uniformity in ballot marking, and prevents identification of the ballot. By no stretch of the imagination is it possible to bring any of the markings objected to within the category of \u201can (X)\u201d. If the legislature had intended to invalidate merely the vote cast in the block in which the defective marking was made, rather than to void the entire ballot, it would have so provided, as was done in the case of an erasure, mutilation, etc.\nMcCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, 337 Pa. 552, 11 A. 2d 893, is an analogous case. An examination of ballots under consideration in that case shows that the marks on three of them to which objections were raised are quite similar to the defective markings on the ballots in the instant case. It seems to me that we fell into error in that case when we failed to declare invalid ballots, Exhibits \u201cD\u201d, \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d, and that we are repeating that error when we do not here declare invalid ballots, Exhibits \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d. I am convinced that the word \u201comit\u201d thrice written On Exhibit \u201cD\u201d, and the extremely large indelible smear or smudge in the party column of Exhibit \u201cJ\u201d, in McCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, supra, rendered those ballots void, because the writing and the smear or smudge made the ballots capable of identification, just as clearly as though the voter had initialed the ballots or signed his name thereon; and that the mark on Exhibit \u201cI\u201d, composed of more than two cross-marks, made in the Member of Council block, opposite the name of Michael J. McCaffrey, was not \u201can (X) \u201d, \u201cirregular in form\u201d, but was either an attempted \u201cmutilation\u201d which rendered void only the vote for the candidates in that block; or was a mark other than \u201can (X)\u201d, which made void the ballot in it's entirety. I am forced to conclude that we should overrule McCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, supra, in order to do justice in the instant case, to maintain the intention of the legislature, as plainly expressed in the Election Code, and what is even more important, to protect the secrecy of the ballots of all citizens against identifying marks or irregular or defective markings, which invite fraudulent practices in all elections.\nThe Election Code sets standards which are the only safe guide to the intention of the voter. The legislature left no choice; compliance with these standards is mandatory. Whether the improper marking be made through lack of skill, infirmity, or inadvertence makes no difference. Since the voters, whose ballots are here under consideration, disregarded the mandate of the lawmakers and did not avail themselves of an opportunity of obtaining another ballot, as provided by Article XII, \u00a71214 (b) of the Code that \u201cif an elector inadvertently spoils a ballot, he may obtain another upon returning the spoiled one\u201d, they automatically disenfranchised themselves. The learned court below could not have found otherwise and very properly excluded both ballots.\nI would affirm the order appealed from and declare Bauman to be the person elected to the office of Township Commissioner for the Third Ward of Shaler Township.",
