        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal from a decree directing the defendants to reeonvey to the plaintiffs certain real estate which Jacques Stiegelmann, the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, had granted and conveyed to Carrie M. Aekman. Stiegelmann instituted the suit after the grantee\u2019s death, and the defendants are Mrs. Ackman\u2019s heirs at law and their respective spouses. The plaintiff died subsequent to the entry of the decree below and his executors were thereupon substituted of record for him. The plaintiff based his right to a reconveyance of the property upon the allegation that his deed to Mrs. Aekman was delivered without his authority or consent. The question involved is whether the proofs sustained the allegation.\nAfter a trial on the merits, the court below filed an adjudication, holding that the plaintiff had failed to meet his burden. A decree nisi dismissing the bill of complaint was entered accordingly. On petition of the plaintiff, a rehearing was granted at which additional evidence was received. Thereafter, the learned chancellor reversed his original conclusion and held that Stiegelmann had not legally conveyed the property to Mrs. Aekman \u201cbecause there is no proof of the deed ever having been delivered to the grantee\u201d. While this conclusion is contained in what the trial court denominated a' finding of fact, the evidence from which it was drawn appears in the discussion contained in the adjudication filed after the rehearing.\nThe pertinent inquiry, as we have indicated, is whether there is any competent proof to justify a conelusion that the deed was not legally delivered to the grantee. Originally, the learned chancellor had found that \u201cJacques Stiegelmann conveyed the real estate * * * [in controversy] to Carrie M. Ackman for a good and valuable consideration\u201d and that \u201cSaid deed of conveyance, dated April 19, 1937, was duly recorded by counsel for plaintiff [Stiegelmann] and at his direction.\u201d These findings were logical deductions from the evidence which the trial court accredited and which shows the following:\nThe plaintiff, a widower about seventy-six years old, persuaded Mrs. Ackman, a distant relative, to act as housekeeper in his home.near Cornwells, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. At that time Mrs. Ackman was residing in her home in Roxborough, Philadelphia, some miles distant from Cornwells. Having, consented to attend to Stiegelmann\u2019s housekeeping and after having made the trip (daily for some time) between Roxborough and Cornwells by automobile for the purpose indicated, Mrs. Ackman moved to the vicinity of Stiegelmann\u2019s home and there resided in the house on the property which is the subject matter of this litigation. Extensive repairs and alterations were made to the house immediately prior .to Mrs. Ackman\u2019s occupancy of it, all of which wei\u2019e paid for by Stiegelmann. Latex*, with members of her family, she moved into Stiegelmann\u2019s home. He paid all of the living expenses, Mrs. Ackman\u2019s children performing some work about the place in return for their maintenance.\nThe evidence as to the drawing of the deed and its recording appeared from the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Edward H. Buckley. The learned chancellor, 'in his discussion of the evidence after the rehearing, summarized Buckley\u2019s testimony in material part as follows: \u201cthe plaintiff [Stiegelmann] directed his then attorney and real estate agent, Edward H. Buckley, Esq., to prepare a deed for the * * * property [now in controversy] with Carrie,M. Ackman as grantee. * *.\u2022* The deed was executed in April, but * * * was never recorded until the following August when, according to the testimony of Buckley, Mrs. Ackman, accompanied by the plaintiff, visited his office and inquired about her deed. Buckley looked at his client, the plaintiff in this matter, for instructions and interpreted a nod of his head as acquiescence in Mrs. Ackman\u2019s demand. The deed was thereupon recorded and subsequently returned to Jacques Stiegelmann.\u201d\nThat the deed to Mrs. Ackman was prepared by Buckley as attorney for and at the direction of Stiegelmann and that the latter voluntarily executed it on April 19, 1937, stand as unexceptionable facts. It is also a matter of admitted record-proof that the deed was recorded on August 10, 1937. In explanation of the delay in the recording of the deed, Buckley testified that,-of his own volition, he purposely withheld the deed from record in the belief that Stiegelmann might possibly change his mind about the matter. Thus, the unrecorded deed was still in Buckley\u2019s office when Stiegelmann and Mrs. Ackman called there on or about August 10, 1937. At that time she asked Buckley in Stiegelmann\u2019s presence, \u201cWhere is my deed?\u201d Buckley looked at Stiegelmann who \u201cnodded his head\u201d in assent. Whereupon Buckley said, \u201cYou can have your deed in about three weeks\u201d, that being the period of time which Buckley estimated would be required for the recording, to which he attended forthwith.\nDelivery of the deed was, of course, necessary to render it legally operative: Rynier Estate, 347 Pa. 471, 474, 32 A. 2d 736; Cragin\u2019s Estate, 274 Pa. 1, 4, 117 A. 445. It was the opinion of the court below, following the rehearing, that \u201cThe only possible interpretation of constructive delivery could be the fact that the deed [after the recording] was mailed [by Buckley] to the common domicile of both of them [Stiegelmann and Mrs. Ackman], but in the name of Jacques Stiegelmann.\u201d If delivery of the deed rested upon that circumstance, then, obviously, there was no delivery. Actually, Buckley did not mail the deed to Stiegelmann until more than a year after Mrs. Ackman\u2019s death on April 4, 1938. Throughout the period from the time the deed was executed on April 19, 1937, until Buckley mailed it to Stiegelmann in July of 1939, it was in Buckley\u2019s office except for the two or three weeks required for its recording consequent upon Stiegelmann\u2019s and Mrs. Ackman\u2019s visit to Buckley\u2019s office as above stated.\nHowever, delivery may be found, just as the learned chancellor originally found it, from Stiegelmann\u2019s nodded assent to Mrs. Ackman\u2019s request for the deed in Buckley\u2019s office wherewith Buckley then complied, as he indicated he would do, by placing it on record. The circumstances so shown were legally sufficient to constitute a constructive delivery. Delivery is to be inferred from the words and acts of a grantor evidencing an intention on his part to surrender his title to the property (embraced by his conveyance) and to invest his grantee therewith. Such an intent, accompanied by actions or words sufficient to effectuate it, spells delivery: Rynier Estate, supra, at p. 475; see also Dayton v. Newman, 19 Pa. 194, 199; and Long v. McHenry, 45 Pa. Superior Ct. 530, 533, and cases there cited.\nMoreover, the deed was in fact recorded. The recording, of itself, raised a presumption of delivery: Chambley v. Rumbaugh, 333 Pa. 319, 320, 5 A. 2d 171; Lewis v. Merryman, 271 Pa. 255, 258, 114 A. 655. In the Merry-man case, supra (p. 260), \u201cThe strongest evidence of delivery was the fact of recording\u201d. In that case this Court said that \u201cthe burden of overcoming the presumption resulting * * * [from recording] was on * . * * [the grantors], who, to destroy it, must do so by clear, positive proof that no delivery was intended, and that * * * [the depositary] was not authorized to record the instrument.\u201d The mere assertion of a grantor that his deed was not delivered is ordinarily not sufficient to overcome the presumption of delivery arising from recording: Lewis v. Merryman, supra; Clymer v. Groff, 220 Pa. 580, 583-4, 69 A. 1119; Kern v. Howell, 180 Pa. 315, 321, 36 A. 872; Ingles v. Ingles, 150 Pa. 397, 400, 24 A. 677; and Long v. McHenry, supra.\nIn order to show that the recording in the instant case was unauthorized, the plaintiff averred that Buckley was to hold the deed in escrow but that \u201cCarrie M. Ackman went to the office of the said Edward H. Buckley and instructed him to record the aforementioned deed\u201d and that \u201cpursuant to her instructions\u201d Buckley did so. In the adjudication first filed, the learned chancellor expressly found that the deed had been recorded at Stiegelmann\u2019s direction. That finding was based upon Buckley\u2019s testimony, which was ample to support it. In the adjudication filed following the rehearing, the trial court stated that Buckley \u201ctestified substantially the same at the second hearing as at the first, but [that] his evidence was contradicted\u201d by two named attorneys \u201cwho [had] represented the plaintiff at the original hearing * * *\u201d and had withdrawn as counsel in order to qualify as witnesses for the plaintiff at the rehearing. Because of the contradiction which the testimony of these witnesses injected, the learned chancellor found that \u201cBuckley\u2019s testimony is very unsatisfactory\u201d and then suggested (but did not actually find) that, perhaps, Mrs. Ackman had directed that the deed be recorded without any assent from the grantor and contrary to his intent.\nThe witnesses called by the plaintiff at the rehearing in refutation of Buckley testified that he had told them in August 1939 that Mrs. Ackman had come to his office alone in August 1937 and had then instructed him to record Stiegelmann\u2019s deed to heri Plainly, that testimony contradicted Buckley who had testified that Mrs. Ackman was accompanied by Stiegelmann and that the recording was with Stiegelmann\u2019s indicated acquiescence. One of the refuting witnesses also testified that Miss Hall, Buckley\u2019s secretary, whose' testimony corroborated Buckley in material regard, had told him that Mrs. Ackman had come to Buckley\u2019s office alone and had instructed him to record the deed.\nThe credibility and weight of the oral testimony were, of course, for the trier of the facts. It was, therefore, the.trial court\u2019s prerogative to believe or disbelieve Buckley and Miss Hall, just as it saw fit. But, the learned chancellor went further and treated the testimony, given in refutation of Buckley and Miss Hall, as substantive proof of the facts contained in the contradictory statements. Thus, in addition to finding, after the rehearing, that Buckley\u2019s testimony was \u201cvery unsatisfactory\u201d, the trial court disposed of the question of delivery upon alternative assumptions, one of which was that the deed had been recorded at Mrs. Ackman\u2019s instance without Stiegelmann\u2019s consent or approval. In so doing, the learned chancellor erred. The contradictory statements were competent for no more than to discredit the testimony of Buckley and Miss Hall. The contradictions were not proof that Mrs. Ackman had directed that the deed be, recorded contrary to Stiegelmann\u2019s desire and intent.: Harrah v. Montour Railroad Company, 321 Pa. 526, 527, 184 A. 666; Zavodnick v. A. Rose & Son, 297 Pa. 86, 90, 146 A. 455; Scheer v. Melville, 279 Pa. 401, 404-405, 123 A. 853; Commonwealth v. Deitrick, 221 Pa. 7, 16, 70 A. 275. See, also, Wigmore on Evidence, Yol. 3 (Third Ed.), .\u00a7 1018, p. 687 et seq.\nPull respect for the rule of evidence to which we have just referred is all the more essential where, as in the present instance, a litigant seeks to impeach the credibility of his own witnesses under the guise of correcting mistakes, in their testimony. Buckley and Miss Hall were produced by the plaintiff who then sought to discredit them with respect to the one matter of materiality in their testimony. See Evans v. Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, 322 Pa. 547, 558, 186 A. 133, and cases there cited. But, even though the, testimony in refutation of Buckley and Miss Hall were disregarded as incompetent in the circumstances, still we could not properly say that they should have been accredited just as the trial court had originally accredited Buckley. In last analysis, their: credibility , and the weight to be given their testimony were matters peculiarly for the trial court\u2019s appraisal.\nWho caused the deed to be recorded and under what circumstances it was recorded were facts crucial to the question of delivery. The plaintiff averred, and had the burden of proving, that the recording was the result of unauthorized directions from Mrs. Ackman. There is no evidence in the case to justify any such finding. Nor was a finding to that effect actually made. Whether Buckley\u2019s and Miss Hall\u2019s testimony be believed or disbelieved, the result would be the same. If believed, then it justifies the finding originally made by the learned chancellor that the deed was recorded at Stiegelmann\u2019s direction ; and, if disbelieved, then there is nothing in the case from which any finding concerning the recording can be made. In either event, the plaintiff fails to meet his burden of showing that th\u00e9 recording of the deed was unauthorized. And, the presumed delivery arising from the recording stands unrebutted.'\nThe remaining matters urged by the plaintiffs merit little discussion. The fact that Stiegelmann, after Mrs. Ackman\u2019s death, leased the property in question under a lease which he had Buckley prepare for that purpose was ineffectual to impair whatever title Mrs. Ackman had acquired in her lifetime. Stiegelmann\u2019s action in such regard was self-serving. Cf. Lewis v. Merryman, supra; Clymer v. Groff, supra; Kern v. Howell, supra; Ingles v. Ingles, supra; and Long v. McHenry, supra. He knew, when he made the lease, that the legal title to the property was in Mrs. Ackman as a matter of official record. Prior to her death, he had had Buckley prepare a deed of reconveyance which he took to the hospital, where Mrs. Ackman was then confined, for her execution. She was so far in extremis, at that time that the deed was not submitted for her signature and nothing came of that matter. But, it did confirm, what Stiegelmann\u2019s testimony otherwise discloses, \u2014 that he knew, when he made the lease, that the title to the property was in Mrs. Ackman as a consequence of his deed to her.\nThe decree is reversed at the appellees\u2019 costs.",
