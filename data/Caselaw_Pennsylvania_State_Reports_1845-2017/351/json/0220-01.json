        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, in a Workmen\u2019s Compensation case. The question is: Was the deceased husband of claimant at the time he met with a fatal accident \u201can independent contractor\u201d or \u201can employee?\u201d The Eeferee found that the deceased was the former, the Compensation Board found that he was the latter, the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County affirmed the Board, and the Superior Court reversed the Court of Common Pleas. The facts in this case are few and no one of them is conclusive. The decision must depend on the facts taken in their entirety. Are they an indicia of a master and servant relationship or of Thomas\u2019 status as an independent contractor? The answer to that question decides this case. The deciders must reach a decision by way of inferences.\nWe agree with the Superior Court in its statement that \u201cThere is no disagreement or dispute in the testimony as to the material basic facts in the case. Hence, the question ... is not really one of fact, but of law . . . and is therefore subject to review and revision by the court, whose duty it is to declare the legal effect of the facts in evidence.\u201d\nIn deciding this question there is both a rule of procedure and a rule of policy which must be applied. The former is that the burden of proving that the deceased James Thomas was an employee was on the claimant: Sechrist v. Kurtz Bros., 147 Pa. Superior Ct. 214, 24 A. 2d 128. The rule of policy is: \u201c. . . neither the compensation authorities nor the courts should be solicitous to put claimants in that position [of an independent contractor] when a reasonable view of the evidence warrants a finding that the injured person was an employee\u201d: Gailey v. State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund, 286 Pa. 311, 314. To the same effect is Myers v. Maurer & Myers, 144 Pa. Superior Ct. 385. These two rules can be reconciled only by saying that while the burden of proof is on the claimant, the preponderance in favor of the claim need only be a slight one, and in drawing inferences from the facts the inferences in favor of the claim need make only a slightly stronger appeal to reason than possible inferences in opposition to it.\nAt the hearing before the referee the parties agreed to a stipulation of facts, of which we quote only the following: \u201cThat James Thomas died on June 26, 1940 as a result of an injury by an accident sustained on June 25, 1940 while engaged in reshingling the roof of a store located at 78 West Broad Street, Nanticoke, Pa., owned by the defendant, Carter Bache. . . . That the defendant, Carter Bache, was the owner and operator of a large retail grocery and meat store in the City of Nanticoke and a branch store in the Village of Alden, of eleven farms with approximately fifty buildings thereon, and several pieces of improved real estate in the City of Nanticoke, including three apartment buildings, a double frame dwelling (two family dwelling) and two single dwellings, which later developed pieces were occupied by tenants who paid or should pay rent. That the decedent, a carpenter by trade, was engaged by the defendant, Carter Bache, to reshingle the roof on the said business place at 78 West Broad Street, Nanticoke. That upon occasions during several years preceding the accident the defendant had Mr. Thomas do certain carpentry work in and about the properties Avhich the defendant owned and that on some of those occasions if the work required it Mr. Thomas had the aid of other carpenters whom he, Mr. Thomas, hired. That the work of Mr. Thomas for Mr. Bache was not exclusive nor was it consecutive. By exclusive is specifically meant that Mr. Thomas worked for others and that he did not work for Mr. Bache solely. That the decedent worked for the defendant intermittently for the last three or four years, in the performance of all of the work in his line . . . that the business and properties of Mr. Bache in Nanticoke required. . . . That during the relationship on various occasions between the defendant and the decedent all materials were purchased either directly by the defendant or by Mr. Thomas, the decedent, and in the latter event charged to the defendant by the seller of the materials. That the job started approximately two Aveeks before the day of the accident [but there had been only four days\u2019 work done on it before June 25.]\u201d\nThe Referee made certain findings of fact in harmony AArith the stipulation and also the following facts, inter alia:\n\u201c9. The decedent hired 4 men to work with him on the job of reshingling the defendant\u2019s roof. One of these men was hired by the decedent at the direction of the defendant. These men were paid [for] each day by the defendant at the rate of $7.00 per day. Their time was turned in to the defendant by the decedent.\n\u201c12. The materials necessary for the reshingling of the defendant\u2019s roof in June, 1940 were ordered by the decedent and charged to the defendant. The defendant paid for these materials.\n\u201c14. We find as a fact that the defendant was not engaged in the construction of buildings.\n\u201c15. The work done by the decedent and 4 men who worked with him was directed entirely by the decedent, who also supplied the equipment with which the work was done.\n\u201c17. We find as a fact that the decedent was not employed by the defendant but was engaged by the defendant as an independent contractor.\n\u201c18. We find as a fact that the work being performed by the decedent for the defendant was casual and not in the regular course of business of the defendant.\u201d\nThe Board affirmed all of the findings of fact of the Referee except the 9th, 14th, 15th, 17th and 18th, which it set aside, and substituted instead the following:\n\u201c9. The decedent had 4 men working with him re-shingling the defendant\u2019s roof. One of these men, Hayden Davis, was employed at the express direction of the defendant; another, Albert Cease, was employed with the permission of the defendant and a third was a regular employee in the meat and grocery store of the defendant. These men were paid by the defendant at the rate of $7.00 per day, the time for the men being turned in to the defendant by the decedent.\n\u201c14. In addition to conducting a retail meat and grocery business, defendant was engaged in the real estate business operating three apartment houses containing 13 apartments.\n\u201c15. For a period of approximately six years prior to June, 1940 decedent had done all of the carpentry work required on any of the buildings owned by the defendant.\n\u201c16. While the work done by the decedent was not directed by the defendant, the defendant had the right to control all of the work performed by the decedent for him.\n\u201c17. The relationship between the decedent and defendant was that of employer-employee.\n\u201c18. The work being performed by the decedent for the defendant was not casual and was in the regular course of the defendant\u2019s business.\u201d\nThe Superior Court criticized the Board\u2019s 9th finding of fact, chiefly for the statement contained therein that'\u201cthe time for the men being turned in to the defendant by the decedent,\u201d and for the statement that the four men were hired by Thomas. The Superior Court said: As to the two carpenters, Davis and Cease, \u201cBache had asked Thomas to hire Davis. He knew of Th\u00f3m\u00e1s\u2019- hiring of Cease.\u201d \u201cMr. Bache had not hired\u201d the two laborers \u201cLewis and a boy named Clapps. . . He did' not know who [they] were previous to their coming to work.\u201d The Superior Court also criticized the Board\u2019s 14th finding that \u201cdefendant was engaged in the real estate business operating three apartment houses containing 13 apartments\u201d in all, and the Board\u2019s setting aside the Referee\u2019s finding of fact that \u201cthe work done by the decedent and four men who worked with him was directed entirely by the decedent [Thomas], who also supplied the equipment with which the work was done.\u201d\nThe record facts in respect to the ninth finding are as follows: Bache testified that \u201cI told him [Thomas] I wanted Mr. Davis to work on the job.\u201d Thomas answered : \u201cAll right.\u201d \u201cHe [Thomas] said he would get Cease [also, to work on the job], was that all right? And I said yes.\u201d In other words, Bache not only \u201cknew\u201d of Cease\u2019s employment, but he expressly consented to it. As to the laborer, Clapps,. Bache in his testimony referred to him as \u201cMy boy; a boy [who] worked in the store, Clapps.\u201d It is a reasonable inference that Bache directed the employment of Clapps on this job; he must at least have consented to his employment since Clapps was a helper in his store. As the record does not show how Clapps was paid, the inference is that his pay as a boy working in Bache\u2019s store continued. The carpenter, Hayden Davis, testified as follows:\n\u201cI met Mr. Bache before this job was started. He said he was going to put a new roof on, and he said when he was ready to put it on he would have Mr. Thomas notify me. So when the job started Mr. Thomas called me up the day before, so I went to work.\u201d\nDavis said: \u201cThomas acted as foreman there,\u201d and that he, Davis, \u201clooked to Mr. Bache for his money\u201d and he \u201csupposed\u201d Bache \u201ccould have discharged\u201d him. The fact that Thomas did not actually \u201cturn in\u201d to Bache the \u201ctime\u201d of the two carpenters and the two laborers on the job, is unimportant. A \u201cturning in of time\u201d by a foreman to the paying employer is for the latter\u2019s protection. In the instant case the employees \u201cturned in\u201d their own time, for as the Superior Court says, \u201cBache knew them personally and relied on their word.\u201d\nAs to Bache\u2019s business, in addition to keeping a store, it is clearly set forth in the stipulation. He owned, in addition to his store, eleven farms, with buildings and \u201cthree apartment buildings, a double frame dwelling, and two single dwellings. That these tenanted and other properties required in their maintenance considerable carpenter work from time to time, which Thomas performed for Bache \u201cduring several years,\u201d clearly appears. As to Thomas\u2019 directing the work of the four other men on their job, that is entirely consistent with his status as foreman-employee, as we later point out.\nThe record discloses that a very loose arrangement was entered into by Bache and Thomas for this shingling job. There was no formal contract, either oral or written, and no plans or specifications. Bache testified: \u201cI told him [Thomas] I wanted to put a roof on and that I would buy the shingles and the nails.\u201d Thomas replied: \u201cAll right.\u201d Bache said: \u201cI never asked him [Thomas] how much he would charge me for the job.\u201d Apparently it was understood that Thomas and the carpenters were each to receive $7 a day, which was the same pay as Thomas had customarily received on the other carpenter jobs performed by him for Bache from time to time for several years. Hayden Davis testified that Thomas told him \u201cthe rate of wages on that job would be f>7 [a day].\u201d Cease, one of the carpenters, testified that he was paid $7 a day by Bache, that Thomas told Mm (Cease) that \u201cCarter Bache\u2019s rate of wages was $7 [a day] and said if we put in any more than that we wouldn\u2019t have any more work.\u201d He said: \u201cJim Thomas was boss, he was foreman.\u201d Both Davis and Cease testified that they gave none of their pay to Thomas.\nBache replied \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cYou could have dismissed him [Thomas] and gotten somebody else to do the job, could you not?\u201d In so answering, the clear implication is that Bache believed that he could have dismissed Thomas at any time and without being liable for breach of contract, as would have been the case had Thomas been an independent contractor. 14 Ruling Case Law, Sec. 8, p. 71, states: \u201cThe power of an employer to terminate the employment at any time is incompatible with the full control of the work which is usually enjoyed by an independent contractor, and hence is considered as a strong circumstance tending to show the subserviency of the employee. Indeed, it has been said that no single fact is more conclusive, perhaps, than the unrestricted right of the employer to end the particular service whenever he chooses, without regard to the final result of the work itself.\u201d\nThomas furnished the tools needed for the work. Bache said he \u201cimagined\u201d that the only tools used on this job were \u201cthe saw and hammer and axe which every carpenter has or should have.\u201d Bache also testified that it was \u201cfive or six years ago\u201d when he first had Thomas do \u201cgeneral work\u201d (apparently carpenter work) in his (Baehe\u2019s) \u201cbusiness places\u201d and that his and Thomas\u2019 relationship was \u201cvery satisfactory.\u201d\nAs to the frequency of Thomas\u2019 employment by Bache, Mrs. Thomas testified: \u201cWhenever he [Bache] called him [Thomas], he went to work for him.\u201d As Mrs. Thomas thus described the nature of the work her husband had done for Bache, from time to time: One night garage doors \u201cwent wrong\u201d and her husband went down at once to \u201cfix them.\u201d Another night he \u201cworked all night to put a floor in; because the store was busy he did that on a few nights.\u201d Thomas also remodeled for Bache \u201cone of the apartments,\u201d \u201ctore out partitions,\u201d \u201cremodeled a barn,\u201d \u201cworked on another apartment and built a garage.\u201d Thomas might be described as Bache\u2019s \u201chandy man\u201d at any kind of carpentry work that Bache needed; Bache answered \u201cYes sir?\u2019 to the following question: \u201cOver a period of years that Mr. Thomas had. done this work for you you did have a general understanding, did you not, that he would do your general carpentry, work for you?\u201d\n\u201cThe vital test in determining whether a workman\u201d is a servant of the person who engages him for the work \u201cis whether\u201d he is \u201csubject to\u201d the latter\u2019s \u201ccontrol or right of control not only with regard to the work to be done but also with regard to [the], manner of performing it\u201d: Venezia v. Phila. Elec. Co., 317 Pa. 557, 177 A. 25. In Scheel v. Shaw, 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 74, 76, the same test of whether a man in doing a certain act is the servant of the master is expressed in the following language : \u201cWas the act done in business of which the master is in control as proprietor, so that he can at any time stop or continue it, and determine the way in which it shall be done, not merely in reference to the result reached, but in reference to the method of reaching the result. ...\u201d\nTested by this standard we think the following facts reasonably sustain the contention that Thomas was the servant of Bache:\n1. Bache testified that he \u201ccould have dismissed\u201d Thomas from \u201cthe job.\u201d While even an independent contractor can be dismissed from the performance of his contract, the man who dismisses him must either be able to justify legally the dismissal or respond to him in damages. The implication of Bache\u2019s testimony is that he believed that he could dismiss Thomas at will, with or without cause.\n2. Of the two carpenters other than Thomas, employed on the job, Bache selected one carpenter, consented to the employment of the other, and of the two laborers employed, one of them was on his payroll as a helper in his store. For obvious reasons an independent contractor jealously reserves the right to hire his own workmen.\n3. Thomas received from the job no profit, either directly or indirectly, but only a daily wage. While this fact is not conclusive, yet when a workman is employed at a daily -wage, the inference that he is a servant and not an independent contractor, will in the vast majority of cases be in accordance with the fact.\n4. All the employees, as well as Thomas himself, directly reported \u201ctheir time\u201d to Bache and were paid by him. While this fact is not conclusive it tends to support the claim that Thomas was not an independent contractor.\n5. The looseness of Bache\u2019s engagement of Thomas for this job is more nearly consistent with the relationship of master and servant than that of owner and independent contractor. When a person engages a contractor to do a repair job on the former\u2019s property there is usually an explicit arrangement about the cost of the job, the time limit for performance, etc., but when a master engages a servant to do work for Mm, he is likely to rely for his own protection not on a contract, oral or written, but on his power to dismiss that servant at will.\n6. The fact that for several years, either at Mght or by day, Thomas was at the \u201cbeck and call\u201d of Bache to do any kind of carpenter. or repair work for him at a daily wage, tends to give him the status of an employee and not that of an independent contractor; '\nIn support of the claim that Thomas was an independent contractor it is contended that \u201cThomas had full control of the men and directed them what they should do.\u201d The weakness of this argument, is that the fact stated fits into the status of foreman as welLas into the status of independent contractor. The two carpenters who worked with Thomas described him as their foreman. A foreman is exactly what the ;name implies. He leads, i.e., directs, other employees. A .section foreman on a railroad or a highway not only has full control of his men and directs them but customarily can \u201chire and fire\u201d them. This is true also of a mine foreman, who ordinarily has hundreds of men under his direction. He ranks as an \u201cemployee\u201d: Sec. 202. of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1915. Under the Act of .June 1, 1915, P. L. 716, a mine foreman has \u201cfull charge of .all the inside worMngs and the persons employed therein,\u201d yet a mine foreman is not an independent contractor. He is legally \u201cunder the supervision and control of the operator,\u201d though the latter may never even visit the mine and may be, and often is, utterly ignorant, of the .art. of managing a coal mine. He is interested only \u201cin . the results of the operation.\u201d ,\nIn further support of the contention that Thomas was an independent contractor and not an employee the fact is emphasized that one day Thomas took carpenter Cease off the Bache job and sent him to the \u201cShriner Estate\u201d to do a half day\u2019s work there. This work consisted only of \u201cputting in a window, that is, cut an opening and frame and patch up the siding around there\u201d [quoting from Cease\u2019s testimony).\nConsidering the long continued and friendly relationship existing between Bache and Thomas, characterized by implicit confidence in each other\u2019s fair dealing, we cannot say that Thomas\u2019 act in taking Cease off the Bache job and putting him to work on another job directed by Thomas, and which \u201cthey claimed\u201d was \u201ca contract job between Thomas and Shriner\u201d proves that Thomas\u2019 relationship to Bache in the shingling job was that of an independent contractor. It may well be that Cease was not needed on the Bache job for that half day, and that he could be spared for that brief period to help another person in need of his services in putting in a new window. Thomas in his capacity of \u201cforeman\u201d might reasonably have taken it for granted that Bache would not object to his letting Cease \u201chelp out\u201d for a half a day on another job, especially as it cost Bache nothing. We think it is not unusual for a foreman on jobs which are being done for an obliging employer (as Bache apparently was) to let one of his employees off for a short period to help someone in urgent need of help. Among the powers usually vested in any \u201cforeman\u201d is that of giving any of his men a \u201cday off\u201d occasionally.\nIn interpreting wills this court has said (Williamson\u2019s Est., 302 Pa. 462, 466, 153 A. 765, quoting from an 18th century English scholar) : \u201cNo will has a brother.\u201d It may with equal appropriateness be said that of the many \u201cclose cases\u201d involving the same question as is presented by this record and reaching the two appellate courts of the state that no two of them present substantially the same facts. All the cases cited in support of the contention that Thomas was an independent contractor can be distinguished from the instant case. For example, in Long v. Eastern Paving Co., 295 Pa. 163, 145 A. 71, the driver-owner of a truck doing hauling Avork for another and not subject to that other\u2019s orders, except as to the place of loading or unloading was held to be an independent contractor. In Koch v. Matter et al., 307 Pa. 337, 161 A. 309, we held the facts to be \u201cplaintiff was bound to complete the work\u201d for which he was engaged, \u201cand the defendants could not discharge him, or prevent him from finishing it so long as he was performing his contract in good faith.\u201d In the instant case, it is apparent that either Thomas or Bache could have terminated the employment at any time, without liability to the other. In Simonton v. Morton, 275 Pa. 562, 119 A. 732, the contractor employed, paid and had full power to control the workmen. We held that this was practically decisive of his independence. In Smith v. State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund, 262 Pa. 286, 105 A. 90, there was a written communication between the parties which was treated as a contract in which one of the parties agreed to transfer all freight between certain points at stipulated prices, the manner of doing which, including the employment, payment and control of the necessary labor, was left entirely to him. He was held to be an independent contractor. In Bradley v. Chester Materials Co., 151 Pa. Superior Ct. 485, the repair of a steam boiler was held to be \u201cnot of a kind usually performed by or under the control of the person conducting the business. It is otherwise where such Avork is entrusted to a regular employee. . . . The work was of a type usually performed by a specialist\u201d and the Board found that \u201cdefendant did not reserve the right of supervision.\u201d In the instant case the Board found that Thomas \u201chad done all the carpentry work required\u201d on defendant\u2019s buildings for approximately six years. (This practically gave Thomas the status of repairman on Bache\u2019s properties.) The Board also found by what we hold to be a legitimate inference that \u201cthe defendant had the right to control all the work performed by the decedent for him.\u201d\nThe case which the Superior Court says \u201cmost nearly resembles this one\u201d is that of Sechrist v. Kurtz Bros., 147 Pa. Superior Ct. 214, but that case and this are distinguishable. The claimant there was an electrician and his services were \u201cspecialized\u201d; it was \u201cto change the electric power mains in defendant\u2019s plant.\u201d That was obviously a job the defendant would know nothing about and would have no desire to attempt to control. As the Superior Court said: \u201cThe work was of the type usually performed by a specialist, and which defendant would not have-been qualified to supervise or direct.\u201d In the instant case, the work done by Thomas, to-wit, laying shingles to a line on a roof and nailing them down, is about as commonplace work as carpenters are ever called upon to perform and if Bache had inspected the work he could have determined whether or not it was being done properly. In the Sechrist case the Superior Court said \u201cwhen he [Sechrist] worked, was largely discretionary.\u201d In the instant case Bache evidently expected Thomas to stay on the job. In the Sechrist case, those who assisted Sechrist \u201cwere never carried on defendant\u2019s payroll.\u201d The Superior Court said this fact is entitled \u201cto some consideration as indicative of lack of intention to create the relation of master and servant.\u201d In the instant case all four employees were carried on defendant\u2019s payroll.\nIn the1 Sechrist case, \u201cthe work,\u201d as the Superior Court pointed out \u201cwhich plaintiff did for defendant was not a part of the regular business of defendant.\u201d In the instant case, Thomas\u2019 work while not a part of defendant\u2019s store business was a part of the defendant\u2019s work 'in the upkeep of his many properties. \u201cAn employee may- be engaged in more than one business\u201d: Dobrich v. Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Corp., 145 Pa. Superior Ct. 87. In the case of Miller v. Farmers Nat. Bank et al., 152 Pa. Superior Ct. 405, 409, the Superior Court said: \u201cMaintenance is a necessary part of the business of op\u00e9rating a building leased to tenants for profit.\u201d In the Sechrist case the Superior Court pointed out that \u201cthe admitted relationship of the parties had previously been that of contractor and contractee.\u201d It also pointed out that \u201cclaimant was performing the work for defendant in accordance with plans which he himself had prepared.\u201d In the instant case there is no evidence that Bache and Thomas ever bore to each other at any time the relations of \u201ccontractor and contractee,\u201d and there were no \u201cplans\u201d for the shingling of the roof. In the Sechrist case the Board of Compensation found the decisive facts to be against the claimant. In the instant case the Board found the decisive facts to be in favor of the claimant.\nA case \u201cresembling\u201d the instant case is that of Miller v. Farmers Nat. Bank et al., 152 Pa. Superior Ct. 405. There the Superior Court in reversing the Beferee, the Board and the Court of Common Pleas held that claimant\u2019s husband who was hired at an hourly rate to paint the ceiling of a hallway in defendant\u2019s bank and who while doing so, fell from a scaffold and was fatally injured was an employee and not an independent contractor. The court stated that the bank in leasing part of its building was engaged in \u201ca limited phase of the real estate business.\u201d It said, \u201cthe fact that the building in question is comparatively small, with few tenants . . . does not change the character of the holding.\u201d\nIt was further held that claimant\u2019s husband was not a mere casual employee of defendant. \u201cSome work of like nature was done in the building last year . . . and decedent was employed to do it.\u201d The bank official said: \u201cHe was our man for that work.\u201d Thomas was for several years Bache\u2019s \u201cman\u201d for \u201cthat work\u201d (repairing Bache\u2019s properties). The Superior Court said in an opinion by Judge Hirt : \u201cOne may be a regular employee if he performs all of the work of a class which the employer can supply; full time employment is not essential to take the work out of the class of casual employment. In Cochrane v. Wm. Penn Hotel, 339 Pa. 549, 16 A. 2d 43, Mr. Justice Stern said: \u201c. . . even though an employment is not continuous, but only for the performance of occasional jobs, it is not to be considered as casual if the need for the work recurs with a fair degree Of frequency and regularity, and, it being, thus anticipated, there is an understanding that the employee is to perform such work as the necessity for.it may from time to time arise.\u201d . . . There is no essential difference, in the nature of the employment, between.the making of frequent minor repairs of furniture and equipment in a hotel and the less frequent but more extensive work of redecorating and rejuvenating a tenant building. Tenure of service may persist throughout the year though the work provided is not continuous.\nWe agree with the Superior Court that \u201cThomas could not be, at the same time, the employer of the men working under him and the employee of- Bach\u00e9.\u201d But we think this record upholds the Board\u2019s findings that while Thomas \u201chad four men working with him reshingling the defendant\u2019s roof,\u201d Bache and not Thomas was the employer of the two carpenters and the one laborer. Who was the employer, of the second laborer does not appear but it is reasonable to infer that he was the same man who employed the other three men, i. e., Carter Bache. Even if Thomas hired all the workmen that would not make Mm their employer within the meaning of the Act. Foremen usually have the right to put men to work-as well as to discharge them.\nAll the surrounding indicia of Bache\u2019s control of Thomas and the other employees in the doing of the work ordered by Bache lead to the determination that Thomas was Bache\u2019s employee and not an independent contractor. As Judge, now President Judge, Keller of the Superior Court Said in 107 Pa. Superior Ct. 166, 171: \u201cIf the owner, or person, for whom the work is done, has the right to select the employees who do the work, the power to remove and discharge them, the right to direct both what work shall be done and the way and manner in which it shall be done, then the relation of master and servant exists.\u201d The record indicates that Bache had the \u201crights\u201d just enumerated. The Board\u2019s 16th finding of fact, supra, in reference to Baclie\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d is supported by sufficient competent evidence, and as Judge Bhodes, speaking for the Superior Court, said in Paulin v. Williams & Co., 122 Pa. Superior Ct. 462, 466, (affirmed in 327 Pa. 579) : \u201cWhere the findings of fact made by the board are based on competent eyidence they are conclusive, and our courts have no power to weigh the evidence and revise those findings or reverse the final action of the board. \u2022 [Citing cases.] Neither the lower court nor an appellate court c\u00e1n say that the board must find one way or another. Although it may feel that the weight of the evidence, as a whole, is against the finding of fact so made, it may not disturb that finding if it is supported by sufficient legally competent evidence. [Citing cases.] There can be no interference by the courts with such findings, whether they be based on proved facts or inferences therefrom. [Citing cases.]\u201d . \u25a0 .\n\u201cIf the facts are not in dispute, and the evidence is direct and certain, presenting no question of credibility, and leaving no sufficient ground for inconsistent inferences of fact, it is for the court to declare their legal effect\u201d: Campagna v. Ziskind, 287 Pa. 403, 408. We declare the legal effect of the facts found by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, on sufficient competent evidence, to be that the relation between Bache and Thomas was that of employer and employee, respectively. We also uphold the Board\u2019s finding that \u201cthe work being performed by the decedent for the defendant was not casual and was in the regular course of the defendant\u2019s business.\u201d\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County in favor of the claimant, Amelia Thomas, and her minor daughter, Marie Thomas, and against the defendant, Carter Bache, and his insurance carrier, Indemnity Insurance Company of \u25a0 North America, is reinstated and affirmed. \u25a0 \u25a0\nWe omit in this opinion the parts of the stipulation, of the Referee\u2019s findings and of the board\u2019s findings, which either are repetitions or are not vital to the decision.\nIn certain opinions the test: \"Was defendant concerned with the result only? is apparently used as equivalent to the test just cited. We think this over-simplified test is of little logical value, for in numerous cases in which the relationship is that of master and servant, the master is \u201cconcerned with the result only.\u201d For example, a car, owner and his chauffeur are respectively master and servant, yet the owner\u2019s only concern in respect to the running of the car may be that it takes him daily to his destination. He may not know how to operate the car and he may exercise no control over its running, but he does retain authority to give orders to the Chauffeur. An owner of a residence with a lawn and trees and shrubbery about it may be concerned only with the result of his caretaker\u2019s work in maintaining a pleasing- milieu; he may not exercise any control over his work, though he can do so. \u25a0 In these modern days of division of labor, a master does not stand over and boss his servants as masters did in a primitive era. Most farm owners in earlier days directed' their \u201cfarm hands.\u201d Many farm owners now have foremen to direct the farm labor and the absent owner is \u201cconcerned only with the result.\u201d\nCease so testified. His testimony was not only \u201chearsay\u201d but also immaterial and irrelevant for Thomas could have been an independent contractor on the Shriner job and merely a foreman on the Baehe \u00a1oh.",
