The eases were consolidated for trial and both appeals raise the same legal questions. Originally, the defendants were Norristown Herald, Inc., which publishes the Times Herald, a daily newspaper, of Norristown, Pennsylvania, and Ralph Beaver Strassburger, the president and substantial owner of that company. The defendants were jointly impleaded on the theory that they were jointly responsible for certain allegedly libelous writings carried by the Times Herald.</p>

The learned trial judge, deeming the verdicts excessive and not correctable by way of remittiturs (being for different sums against.alleged joint tort-feasors), granted the defendants’ motions for a new trial. The plaintiff thereupon discontinued as to Strassburger in each case without objection from the remaining defendant. At the new trial, the jury returned verdicts in the plaintiff’s favor for $15,000 in the case at No. 36 September Term 1942, and for $35,000 in the case at No. <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>83 September Term 1942.

The plaintiff duly filed the remittiturs and judgments wer,e.entered on the verdicts, as thus reduced, in the sums, respectively, of $3,750 in the case at No. 36 below and $8,750 in the case at No. 83.

      <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>. Here, Norristown Herald, Inc., was the master and Strassburger, its servant. With the defendants in that relationship, it was a mistake of law for the plaintiff to treat them as joint tort-feasors. Their torts were several : cf. <em>East Broad Top Transit Company v. Flood, </em><a href="/pa/326/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="326 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1174452" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0353-01">326 Pa. 353</a>, 356, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20401" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="192 A. 401">192 A. 401</a>. Notwithstanding that all parties defendant may now be brought upon the record regardless of whether their liability is joint or several (see <em>Williams v.

The mistake was evident on the face of the pleadings. A formal affidavit, pointing out the error, would not have added anything to what otherwise clearly appeared. Such an affidavit was therefore unnecessary, especially, when none was required by the court as a basis for the discontinuance. In the absence of any objection by the defendant to the entry of the discontinuance or any motion to strike it off, the court’s leave to the plaintiff to discontinue is to be presumed. <em>Shapiro v.

Such has been the rule since the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 981 (12 PS §685). See <em>Gable v. Yellow Cab Co., </em><a href="/pa/300/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="300 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1125919" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0037-01">300 Pa. 37</a>, 38, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20162" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="150 A. 162">150 A. 162</a>; and <em>Cleary v.

It can hardly be suggested, therefore, that the mere discontinuance served to introduce a new cause of action. Nor was a new cause of action in fact introduced by reason of the amendment. The wrongs alleged remained precisely as the plaintiff had originally pleaded them. Consequently, the fact that the statute of limitations had run at the time of the <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>discontinuance was of no legal significance.

The body of the article began with the statement that “If a man is known by the company he keeps or has kept, it may be interesting to Norristown people to be reminded of an automobile smashup * * * in which Chief of Police George Bausewine figured soon after he landed here”. The “smashup” had reference to an automobile collision at a'street intersection in Norristown which had occurred approximately eleven years before. Bausewine had been a passenger in one of the automobiles involved in the collision. The article identified “The driver of the car Bausewine occupied” as “an old-time friend of the chief’s, one Joseph Allegro, who * * * was found guilty at a Montgomery County Court hearing and fined $10 and costs * * The article then stated that “the point of the whole affair is not so much who was responsible for the accident as who was this fellow Allegro, the traveling, companion of Norristown’s chief of police, in whom is vested the direction of this Borough’s public safety in war time”. The article concluded by submitting “the black record, offered in evidence at [Allegro’s] hearing, [which] speak[s] for itself:”.

He controlled the Times Herald, had openly avowed his intention to “get” Bausewine and had personally participated in editing at least one of the offending articles. There was testimony as to hostile statements by Strassburger in amplification of his threat to “get” Bausewine which need not be repeated but which, if believed, must have left little doubt in the minds of the jury as to Strassburger’s animus. As to the reason for this animosity, as revealed by the record, it is unnecessary to say more than that it grew out of Bausewine’s failure to aid Strassburger, as the latter had requested him to do, in connection with a matter purely personal to Strassburger and wholly unrelated to Bausewine either in his public or private capacity. The appellant complains that the occurrences testified to (having happened late in 1940) were too remote to furnish causative malice for the publication of the writings in the summer of 1942. The answer to that is that there was testimony which fully warranted the jury in finding both the existence of actual malice and its persistence, unabated, down to and throughout the time of the publications.</p>

Even without the extrinsic proofs, the assailed publications themselves afforded an inference of malice. That the statements respecting the plaintiff, of which complaint is made, were defamatory is hardly open to dispute. Cf. <em>Collins v. Dispatch Publishing Co., </em>supra, at p. 190. And, it is fairly deducible that their purpose was to affect the plaintiff adversely in his position, which both the editorial and the articles specifically identified. Cf. <em>Holland v. Flick, </em><a href="/pa/212/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="212 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="941884" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0201-01">212 Pa. 201</a>, 204, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.%20828" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="61 A. 828">61 A. 828</a>. If false, the defamatory statements were actionable without proof that any particular damage followed their publication. <em>Collins v. Dispatch Publishing Co., </em>supra.

There was ample evidence in the case to justify the jury in finding that the reference to the plaintiff as “a Philadelphia castoff” and that the imputation that he, while an officer of the law, had ridden bootleggers’ trucks for improper purposes were untrue and lacked any justification. The jury’s findings in such regard, as implied by the verdicts, were but natural and reasonable conclusions from the evidence. The only evidence touching the plaintiff’s surrender of his position on the Philadelphia police force was that he had resigned voluntarily after almost twenty-nine years of continuous service and after having risen to the grade of lieutenant (comparable to captain at the time of trial). As to the imputation that the plaintiff had been a participant in the illegal transportation of contraband liquors, the testi<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>mony proffered by tbe defendant in attempted justification of the cognate publications was so inadequate and insufficient that the learned trial judge, on motion, very properly struck it from the record. The assignments of error based on the court’s action in that instance are plainly without merit. According to the undenied testimony, Bausewine had never been in Boca Baton; and, the defendant failed to prove either that the plaintiff had ridden trucks for illicit purposes elsewhere or that the defendant had any reliable or trustworthy information that he had done so. Insinuating that the plaintiff, while an officer of the law, was a willful law violator came very close to being, if it was not actually, libel <em>per se. </em>Cf. <em>Neeb v. Hope, </em>supra, and <em>Holland v. Flick, </em>supra. The fact that the learned court below did not so treat it, of course, gave the defendant no cause for complaint.</p>

But, here again, whether those statements were privileged depended upon facts which were for the jury to determine. To qualify as fair comment, a publication must have been upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, in a proper manner and must have been based upon reasonable or probable cause. <em>Hartman v.

Under the evidence, it was for the jury to say whether the resurrection of the court record of Allegro’s hearing for a traffic violation, after a lapse of almost eleven years and when it was no longer news, was upon a proper occasion, — and, whether it was done for a proper purpose or from a desire to defame and disgrace the plaintiff to his injury. It was necessary that these and related questions of fact be answered by the jury before it could be determined whether or not the plea of <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>privilege was available to the defendant even in this instance. The privilege which ordinarily attends a newspaper report of court proceedings is not absolute. The privilege may be forfeited by an abuse such as unfair and unwarranted comment. See <em>Boyer v. Pitt Publishing Company, </em>supra, at p. 159, and cases there cited. Privilege is unavailable as a defense when the publication is made from actual malice. See <em>McIntyre v. Weinert, </em>supra, at p. 57.</p>

At most, it was a subsequently transpiring occurrence which, if known at the time of the trial now under review, would not have been admissible. The learned court below therefore correctly overruled that ground as furnishing no reason for a new trial. While it is permissible to show that one claiming damages for injury to his reputation has a bad reputation, proof of separate acts of bad conduct or guilt of criminal offenses is not admissible on an issue of general reputation, not even to mitigate damages. <em>Pease v.

Beyond that, the defendant never made an issue of the plaintiff’s reputation. On the contrary, upon the defendant’s own objection, the learned trial judge foreclosed the plaintiff <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>from offering in rebuttal evidence of tbe plaintiff’s good conduct for the purpose of meeting any adverse inference that might be drawn from tbe defendants testimony. In so ruling, tbe learned trial judge stated, — “There is no insinuation of your [tbe plaintiff’s] character or reputation.” In no event was tbe plaintiff’s reputation material to tbe question of tbe punitive damages for which tbe defendant could- be justly assessed under tbe evidence. To libel, from <em>actual </em>malice, a perr son of even bad reputation may merit punishment by way of damages as much as would such a libel of a person of good reputation. ■ ■ ■</p>

And, the continued existence of tbe actual malice was' further accentuated by tbe defendant’s failure to make good -its plea of truth and justification and, particularly, by its persistence in that plea (at the new trial obtained on its motion) after a jury bad already discountenanced tbe plea and bad rendered verdicts for tbe plaintiff in quite substantial sums.

Tbe defendant’s objection at trial, which resulted in tbe dismissal of tbe jury first drawn, did not go to the qualifications or integrity - of tbe particular jurors. It related solely to tbe manner in which tbe clerk bad drawn tbe jurors’ names from‘the box. Tbe jurors, so dismissed, were therefore very properly returned to the whole panel from which tbe second jury was drawn. Tbe fact that four of tbe original group were among tbe second twenty drawn (subject to chai<a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>lenge) did not harm the defendant. And, the prejudice it ascribes is unrealistic. The whole matter of the dismissal of the first panel of twenty jurors had been heard by the court in chambers out of the jurors’ hearing. Even had they known at whose instance the first drawing had been set aside, that would not have furnished legal cause for subsequent challenge. Anyway, it was too late after a trial on the merits to raise the question which the appellant now urges. See Act of February 21, 1814, P. L. 60 (6 Sm. L. Ill, § 1), 12 P.S. § 711.</p>

The fact that the particular witnesses happened to be former newspapermen and former employees of the defendant did not render them incompetent. The extent of their ability to reflect the impressions of average readers went merely to the credibility of their estimate. Whether they should have been permitted to testify in such regard lay in the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Davis, Trustee, v. Southern Surety Co., </em><a href="/pa/302/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="302 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1129118" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0021-01">302 Pa. 21</a>, 26, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20119" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="153 A. 119">153 A. 119</a>. There was no abuse of discretion. The defendant itself produced two witnesses, who also testified in that regard, but it now complains that all such testimony was irrelevant if not incompetent, citing <em>Pittsburgh, Allegheny and Manchester Passenger Railway Co. v. McCurdy, </em><a href="/pa/114/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="114 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="550065" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0554-01">114 Pa. 554</a>, 559, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.%20230" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="8 A. 230">8 A. 230</a>.

We fail to see any abuse of such discretion. On the other hand, care was uniformly exercised by the court to preclude the injection of passion and prejudice and, to that end, plaintiff’s counsel appears to have cooperated. In the one instance where the plaintiff himself, while on the stand, volunteered a statement to which defendant’s counsel took vigorous exception, the learned trial judge promptly ordered it stricken from the record and properly and adequately cautioned the jury accordingly. The trial was free from substantial error and the appellant has no just cause for complaint.</p>
