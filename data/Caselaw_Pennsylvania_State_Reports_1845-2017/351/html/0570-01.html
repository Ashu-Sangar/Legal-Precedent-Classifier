His election to accept insurance appears on a document signed about February 18,1936, entitled “Acceptance and Payroll Deduction Authority,” hereafter called Acceptance card. It consisted of a form having various blanks to be filled in. Three of the blanks with the entries made in them have present importance. One required the “full name of beneficiary.” In that blank, Holton wrote the name “Betty Heyler.” The next line required the insertion of the “relationship to employee” to the beneficiary. On that line he wrote the word “Estate.” The third line required the “Address of Beneficiary”; on that line he wrote “102 North 18th St., Phila. Pa.” A boarding house or hotel was conducted at 102 North 18th Street, Philadelphia, Pa., and both he and Betty Heyler resided there. He signed that paper and delivered it to his employer.</p>

Pursuant to the provision in the policy quoted above, the Society had issued a certificate which, we assume, was issued '“to the Employer for delivery to” the employee, Holton, setting forth what is stated in the provision quoted from the group policy. In this certificate the beneficiary was designated to be “The Insured’s Executors or Administrators.” This certificate was found by the coroner after Holton’s death in Holton’s room at 102 North 18th Street, Philadelphia, “. . . in the top right-hand drawer of a buffet or whatever you call it in the room.” The certificate is dated March 1,1936.</p>

This uncertainty was detected before the Society’s certificate dated March T, 1936, was issued. The record contains a letter dated February 26,1936, from an employee of the Society to its assistant division group manager in Philadelphia stating: “We note the beneficiary of O. Arthur Holton, #2547A-784 was given as 'Betty Heyler — Estate.’ We assume the employee is naming his Estate as beneficiary, and have issued the certificate accordingly. If this is in accordance with the employee’s wishes, please have the attached Or. 205 form signed by the employee, and the form should be retained by the Company for their records.” The record does not disclose what, if any, action was <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>taken pursuant to that letter .but, that some act resulted, may be inferred from the fact that the insured’s registry card designated the beneficiary as “the Insured’s executors or administrators” and from the fact that the 'certificate dated March 1, 1936, also so designated the. beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[201,614,1151,864]]]'>The learned trial judge, reading the words of the policy that “. . . the beneficiary shall be the person or persons designated in the Employer’s records in accordance with the employee’s election,” with the fact that Holton wrote the name Betty Heyler as beneficiary on the Acceptance card, concluded that she “. . . was literally The person . . . designated on the employer’s records in accordance with the employee’s election.’ ” He then proceeded with an examination of the record to see whether there was any subsequent designation of beneficiary superseding what was written on the Acceptance card, and' concluded there was none and awarded the insurance to Betty Heyler.' He considered the certificate and its retention by Holton as equivocal acts insufficient, without additional evidence, to destroy the inference to be made from the Acceptance card.</p>
    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[198,1489,1160,812]]]'>It is at this point in his analysis of the evidence that we are constrained to differ from the learned judge. In addition to the Acceptance card of February 18, 1936, the record contains the insured’s registry card showing entries by the employer on four dates beginning with March 1, 1936, to April 5, 1941. On that card the beneficiary is stated to be the insured’s executors or administrators. That registry card is as much a part of the employer’s records of Holton’s insurance as the acceptance card. The policy required such records be kept. The registry card was produced by an employee of the. Sun: Shipbuilding Company who was custodian of and had “. . . charge of the records and maintenance of the records of the group insurance plan, group hospitalization plan . . .” of the company.</p>

We must therefore assume that the employer-agent was authorized by its principal, Holton, from and after March 1, 1936, the date of the registry card, to consider the beneficiary as the employee’s executor or administrator, thereby superseding the effect, whatever it might otherwise have been, of the acceptance card. If the employer-agent erred in recording the employee-principal’s designation, the mistake might of course be corrected by proof; the burden would be on Betty Heyler, contending that the employer’s records wrongly stated the fact. Not only is there no evidence of mistake by the agent, but there is evidence to support a finding that if the designation of “executors or administrators,” appearing on the registry card, had not been authorized before the employer made the record, it was ratified and adopted thereafter. This evidence is in the receipt and the retention for more than six years of the certificate issued by the Society to Holton. This certificate of March 1, 1936, shows, on its face, across the middle of the page in quite large letters, that the beneficiary is “insured’s executors or administrators.” The insured was a high school graduate. He retained this certificate until it was found among his effects after his death, for it provided what he should receive from the Society by way of substituted insurance on termination of his employment. It is not without significance that when his employment was terminated in 1940, he continued to retain this certificate and on his re-employment June 18,1940, signed a paper requesting <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>the reinstatement of the insurance “with beneficiary designation therein set forth.” Compare <em>Burt v.
