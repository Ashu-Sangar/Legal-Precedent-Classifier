In October, 1918, her husband, with about $30,000 borrowed from his uncle, Mr. Bowen, purchased 348 shares of stock thus acquiring a majority stock interest in Ward-Davidson, engaged in manufacturing turkish towels and similar textiles. When appellant’s husband died, she was 29 years old, with a son about two years of age. Her husband gave his property to her by will of which she and the defendant were named as executors. Their executors’ account, filed in the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia, showed a small balance of personalty; in addition, her husband left a small investment in real estate; the learned chancellor was unable to state the value of the real estate with certainty but concluded she received from her husband personal and real estate probably worth from $5,000 to $7,000. Appellant was thus deeply concerned about the sufficiency of her husband’s estate to support her and her infant son.</p>

She had no business experience but, nevertheless, on August 30, 1920, was made Secretary<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of the corporation, and was paid a liberal salary and from time to time received “bonus” payments as other officers received them. Her husband’s indebtedness to his uncle, Mr. Bowen, required attention. She advised with him at various times concerning her finances as well as the business of the corporation; she also advised with her father. Her situation and that of the corporation were also considered by the defendant, and one result of the general consideration was the execution of the Deed of Trust <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>dated December 28, 1921, by which she transferred to defendant as trustee, 345 out of 348 of the shares of stock bequeathed to her by her husband. The result of course was that by voting the stock in the trust, defendant could control the corporation, the total" number of shares issued being 632. The. term of the trust was twenty years, said to have been so fixed to cover the minority of plaintiff’s son. There is evidence that the deed of trust<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> was suggested by the plaintiff’s father. The deed was drawn by counsel who represented her and the defendant as executors of her husband’s estate.

Prior to the execution of the deed, and thereafter defendant received a salary and bonuses from the corporation which the chancellor found were paid for services he rendered to the corporation. From time to time treasury stock was issued. The plaintiff was given the right to take it and declined it. She objected to its being taken in the trust and assented <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> to the defendant’s</p>

In dealing with the preemptive right<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> to purchase treasury stock, the learned chancellor said that while these rights had theoretical value they had no actual value from 1925 to 1930. Concerning this stock, some of which was sold to the defendant, the court found that it was not sold at a price so much below book value “as to throw any light or suspicion on the conduct of the defendant in purchasing the same”. He added that, after the interval of from 13 to 17 years since that stock was sold, it was impractical or impossible fairly to ascertain the actual market value of the stock when issued, and that he could not make such a finding from the record. He found specifically that none of the stockholders considered the preemptive right to purchase the stock of any importance or of intrinsic value.</p>

It is equally obvious, if the case turned on the point, that appellant’s 13 years’ delay would be a bar.

This subject was considered at length by the learned court. Specific -findings on the subject were made to the effect that she knew what she was doing and understood the reason and the purpose for doing it; that there was no “fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, coercion, undue influence or abuse of confi-. dence . . .”; that the terms of the-deed, considering its purpose, “were generally fair, just-and equitable”; that she consulted-with counsel representing her and the defendant, executors of her husband’s-estate; that she consulted with her father, “who, on behalf of Plaintiff, had: suggested a Deed of Trust to Defendant”; that she “consulted with, and was advised by, her late husband’s uncle, Harry Bowen, a man of wealth and business experience, on her business and financial affairs”; that she discussed the affairs of the company with a Mr. Henry, “a member of the Philadelphia stock brokerage firm of Biddle &amp; Henry”.

The salaries were fixed by the Board of Directors of which the plaintiff was a member; that they were paid appeared in the annual reports which she received at the time. -The learned chancellor said, “As to what bearing it may have on. the question of the Defendant’s honesty or good faith, we are impressed with three facts, namely; that his average compensation for the twenty-year period does not on its face appear excessive; that during the less prosperous period following 1929, the compensation was voluntarily reduced to an amount that was clearly inadequate; and that Plaintiff’s high salaries were identical with Defendant’s, each of which <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>considerations would tend to remove suspicions of dishonesty or overreaching.” He was, however, of opinion that if the salaries were excessive, the remedy was with the corporation and that the point was not relevant in this proceeding.
