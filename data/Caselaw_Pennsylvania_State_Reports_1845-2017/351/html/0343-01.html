Decedent was the executor of his wife’s estate. Upon <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>her decease he administered the estate and after filing an account made absolute distribution to himself. The husband died over three years after such distribution. Appellant, who claims under the wife’s will, contends that under its terms decedent did not possess an <em>absolute </em>estate in the residue, but possessed only a <em>life estate.</em>

L. 447, 20 PS section 862, and has received no notice of claims, he may properly make distribution even without an accounting.</p>

L. 840, 12 PS section 831, et seq., as amended. We pointed out in <em>Gerety Estate, </em><a href="/pa/349/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="349 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="458200" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0417-01">349 Pa. 417</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20792" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="37 A.2d 792">37 A. 2d 792</a>, that “the remedy under the Declaratory Judgments Acts is not an optional substitute for established and available remedies” or “where another statutory remedy has been specifically provided”. The Orphans’ Court Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, 20 PS section 2082, et seq., and the Fiduciaries Act, supra, direct precisely how a decedent’s estate shall be settled and distributed.</p>

An account can only be audited and distribution decreed in a decedent’s estate in the manner <em>specifically provided </em>by the statute.</p>
