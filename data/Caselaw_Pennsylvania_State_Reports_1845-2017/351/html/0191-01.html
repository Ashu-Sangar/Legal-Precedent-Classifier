By her iast will and testament, she designated Girard Trust Company and Ruth Naomi Schaufler as executors and trustees of her estate, and gave them power to sell her property “for such prices and upon such terms and conditions as to them shall seem best; <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>and to make, execute and deliver good and sufficient deeds . . .” Under this power, the trustees, on May 5, 1943, entered into a written contract with plaintiffs, Martin Kane and Nathan Zucker, for the sale of this real estate to them. Thereafter, but before final settlement and delivery of a deed, David Maimin, a tenant in the property contracted to be sold, offered a substantially higher price to the trustees. This offer was accepted by the trustees and the property was conveyed to Maimin and his wife. Plaintiffs then filed this suit in equity against the trustees and the Maimins, praying for a reconveyance of the real estate to the trustees and for specific performance by the latter of the agreement of sale. The learned chancellor granted the relief sought, and, after the dismissal of exceptions and the entry of a final decree by the court en banc, the trustees and the Maimins filed these appeals.</p>

The agreement also provided that “The purchaser shall also furnish to the seller a policy of title insurance in a company satisfactory to the seller for the full amount of the mortgage”; and that “All sales by fiduciaries being liable to vacation by the courts, this agreement is made upon the express condition that it is subject to the court’s approval if, <em>prior to settlement cmd delivery of deed, </em>proper action is taken in court to prevent the sale or the seller elects to seek a judicial decree before consummating the sale.” (Italics added.)</p>

At that time the settlement sheet prepared by the title company was approved and signed for both parties; plaintiffs deposited with the title company checks in an amount sufficient to meet the cash requirements on the settlement sheet, and executed the bond and mortgage, which they also left with the title company; and leases of tenants on the premises to be sold were assigned by the trustees in blank and given to plaintiffs’ attorney. While the agreement of sale provided that the deed was to be prepared by plaintiffs and be presented to the trustees “for examination and execution at least ten (10) days prior to the time fixed for settlement”, plaintiffs did not present it until this meeting of May 26, 1943.

The latter signed the deed, but before it could be acknowledged by her, or signed and acknowledged by the corporate trustee and delivered to plaintiffs, and before the requested information could be furnished to the title company, the trustees received a written offer of $28,500 cash for the property from the defendant, Maimin. This offer was increased by Maimin to $30,000 cash on June 3,1943. The trustees promptly notified plaintiffs of the receipt of the higher offer, but they made no attempt to increase their offer. On June 5,1943, the trustees accepted the offer of Mai-min and returned to plaintiffs the bond and mortgage, unexecuted, and the hand money paid by them. Three days later the property was conveyed to Maimin and his wife for $30,000 cash. Plaintiffs then filed their bill of complaint. After hearing the learned chancellor, being of the opinion that settlement had been sufficiently effected at the meeting of the parties at the office of the title company on May 26, 1943, and for the reason that the trustees were irrevocably committed to convey the premises to plaintiffs, granted the prayer of the bill. His action was sustained by the court en banc, following argument on defendants’ exceptions.</p>

    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[230,1636,1150,643]]]'>In the instant case there is no dispute as to these well-settled principles of the law of trusts. The controversy depends upon whether or not, in the absence of fraud, unfair dealing or gross inadequacy of price, the sale was consummated and the trustees prevented from setting it aside to accept a higher and more beneficial offer. So plaintiffs contend and the chancellor and court en bane held. Defendants,' however, argue that it was the trustees’ mandatory duty to accept the offer of Mai-min and to rescind the agreement with plaintiffs, since settlement had not been completed, a deed had not been delivered and title had hot passed.</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Our decisions show conclusively that title must pass to the buyer in a matter of this kind before á fiduciary is relieved of the duty to accept a higher bid for trust property. There must be a consummated sale. Until title actually passes the property is a trust asset, and,' so long as it forms part of the corpus of a trust, the trustees must get the highest price obtainable for it. The only exception to this rule would be'where the delay in passing title is due solely to the fiduciaries’ arbitrary tardiness; and the instant case does not fall within that exception. Legal title passes only with the delivery of the deed, and until then the trustee is bound to accept the best offer made for the property. It is obvious that the offer of Maimin of $30,000, all cash, was higher and more, advantageous to the trust estate and to the beneficiaries thereunder than that of plaintiffs, which was $26,500,. of which $20,000 was to be represented by a purchase money bond and mortgage. Therefore, the sale to plaintiffs not having been consummated, the trustees were bound to accept the offer of Maimin.</p>

We there said, in affirming the decree of the court below which refused to set aside the sale because of inadequacy of price (pp. 315-6): “This sale was consummated.
