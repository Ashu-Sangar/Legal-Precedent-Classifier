He brought this action in trespass to recover compensation. After defendant’s motion for a directed verdict was refused, the jury found for plaintiff. <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>The court later entered judgment n. o. v. and plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b91-3" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[214,375,1156,1121]]]'>The accident occurred on June 25,1941, near Jersey-Shore, Clinton County, Pennsylvania, while a New York Central train, in charge of Roller as conductor, was being operated over the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The train had left Avis, travelling west, for Cherry Tree. Prom Avis to Ridge Tower the trip was routed entirely over Pennsylvania lines. At Ridge Tower the route crossed the eastbound track of the Pennsylvania Railroad, entered upon the rails of the New York Central, and proceeded to Cherry Tree. When the train reached Drury Tower, an intermediate point on the route before Ridge Tower, the engineer was given an order in writing by the tower operator, an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad, directing him to take the train onto the siding at Ridge Tower and to remain there for further orders. No notice was given Roller, and he did not know of the order given his engineer. According to the safety rules of both railroads, the conductor, who is actually in charge of the train, should also receive a copy of any such message. That he did not receive such a copy is admitted.</p>
    <p id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[208,1517,1153,803]],["BL_92.1",92,[216,273,1149,642]]]'>At the time of the accident both trains were travel-ling on a permissive block, which, according to the rules of both railroads, permits the movement of one or more trains in the same direction in the block, and it is the duty of the engineer of any train entering such block to keep his train under such control that he can stop within the range of vision. Under the same rules, while a train is in the block, the operator of the tower can set the signal on “permissive” and the train following is thereby advised that the track is obstructed. While the New York Central train was thus travelling within the block, a Pennsylvania train was admitted to the block on such permissive signal. When the New York Central train slowed down preparatory to going upon the siding, its brakeman left the caboose and, as is also required by the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>safety rules, placed two torpedoes on the track to warn approaching trains of his train’s presence. After returning to the caboose the brakeman saw the Pennsylvania train approaching and immediately tried to attract its engineer’s attention by displaying and waving a regulation red flag. Perceiving that the approaching train was evidently not going to stop, the brakeman cried a warning to plaintiff, and jumped to safety. Plaintiff, being seated in the upper part of the caboose, did not have time to vacate it before the Pennsylvania train crashed into and demolished it. As a result, his one arm was amputated and a vertebra in his back crushed.</p>

He stated that he had a clear view for “between three and four hundred feet”, that he knew he was operating in a permissive block and realized what his duties were under such signal. He also testified that he had heard the two torpedoes explode and that he had seen the efforts of the brakeman who tried to flag him.

In <em>Thompson v. Fox, </em>supra, 213, Mr. Justice Stern said: “. . . the principle which underlies the rule is that the injured person is given a legal remedy only to obtain compensation for the damage done to him, and when that compensation has been received from any of the wrongdoers, his right to further remedy is at an end.” Institution of suit against the party released is not a prerequisite to effect satisfaction for injuries sustained: <em>Smith v.

Had the New York Central been joined as a defendant the trial court would have been compelled to give binding instructions in its favor, not because there was no evidence of liability but because Koller, for the consideration of $4500, had released it from any and all liability arising out of the accident. The negligence of the New York Central formed no part of the case; that issue was eliminated by the release. For the same reason, the statement in the opinion that the testimony “leaves no room for doubt that the New York Central was in no way responsible for the accident” is unwarranted and irrelevant. To the contrary, the release in question established a prima facie case of joint negligence and the burden was <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>upon plaintiff to show, if he could, that the party released did not contribute to the accident: <em>Smith v. Roydhouse, Arey &amp; Co., </em>supra, 479. The release, being in writing, should have been construed by the court; the learned judge should have instructed the jury that it was prima facie evidence that the New York Central was also negligent; that the New York Central was not also negligent has not been proven. To the statement in the majority opinion that “throughout the entire case plaintiff carried the. burden of proof of defendant’s negligence” should be added “but has failed to prove non-liability on the part of the New York Central and thus failed to rebut the prima facie case established by the release.” Had appellant undertaken to sustain this burden, as the law requires, he would have been compelled to show that there was no basis in fact or law for his receipt of $4,500. A court of justice cannot permit one to collect $4,500 in full satisfaction for injuries sustained and then deny that there was any justification therefor. We cannot say that the $4,500 payment was a gratuity and that the New York Central had not bought exemption before being sued. This is precisely what occurred in <em>Smith v. Roydhouse, Arey &amp; Co., </em>supra 479. The release offered in evidence is prima facie evidence of the New York Central’s joinder in the tort. In <em>Smith v. Roydhouse, Arey &amp; Co., </em>we said at page 479: “Here the suit against the other had only been threatened, but was threatened for the same cause as that for which the earlier had been brought. The result in each was exactly the same; in that case the party bought exemption from liability after being sued, while in this the party bought exemption before being sued. The act that operated as a bar to the subsequent action was not the bringing of the earlier suit, but the settlement and ex-tinguishment of the cause of action by receiving money from one charged with the negligence which occasioned the injury for which compensation was claimed. If the evidence in the case referred to established a prima facie case on this collateral issue, no less certainly did the <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>paper signed by tbe plaintiff and introduced in this case, releasing the subcontractors from liability for the same injury as that for which he subsequently brought suit against the defendant, together with the admission of record. There being nothing in rebuttal the sufficiency of the evidence was for the court.”</p>

Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/53/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="53 Pa. Super. 638" data-case-ids="435084" data-case-paths="/pa-super/53/0638-01">53 Pa. Superior Ct. 638</a>, 651, the ice company employer was clearly not a joint tortfeasor. The same is true in <em>Thomas v. Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, </em><a href="/pa/194/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="194 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="912439" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0511-01">194 Pa. 511</a>. <em>Turner v. Robbins, </em><a href="/pa/276/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="276 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1077537" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0319-01">276 Pa. 319</a>, rests upon an entirely different basis and is authority for neither proposition here advanced. In none of these cases was the party released directly involved in the cause of action. On the other hand, those cases wherein a release has been held effective show the party to have been directly involved. This case falls within the latter group. Here, as in <em>Smith v. Roydhouse, Arey &amp; Co., </em>supra, and <em>Thompson v. Fox, </em>supra, the party released was directly involved. It was one of the parties to the collision.</p>
