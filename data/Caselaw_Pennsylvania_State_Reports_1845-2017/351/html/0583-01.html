Y., plaintiff delivered the shipment to Goetzman and Newman, and received from them the bill of lading which is the basis of this suit. Goetzman and Newman transported the boxes in a closed truck to the terminal of defendant, Mushroom Transportation Company (hereafter called Mushroom) in Rochester, New York. This depot was a large garage containing loading and unloading platforms for handling freight. We quote the learned trial judge’s statement of the movement of the shipment. On the same day Mushroom “. . . loaded about half of the shipment on a truck which left Rochester on January 5th, at; eight o’clock, P. M., and arrived in Williamsport, Pennsylvania on January 6th at 3:45 A. M., and which after a fifteen minute layover in order to change drivers and refuel, left Williamsport at 4 A. M. and arrived in Philadelphia on January 6th at 1:30 P. M. The balance of the. shipment was loaded on another truck which left Rochester on January 6th and after a similar stop at Williamsport left that City on January 7th at 5 o’clock A. M. and arrived in Philadelphia on January 7th at 11:30 A. M. These trucks were of the ‘closed van type with a.closed top’ and two full length rear doors, with , a tail gate which closed over the rear doors and completely sealed the rear of the vans. The Mushoom Transportation. Company had only one truck scheduled for the Philadelphia run on January 5th, and this truck had only capacity for about one-half of the shipment or 19 boxes. The remaining thirteen boxes were kept on a dock in the back part of its garage until they were shipped the next day. The dock was described as a platform built out about 60 feet from the back wall <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>of the garage which was 200 feet long. The trucks or vans in which the boxes were shipped were neither heated nor refrigerated. The side walls of the vans were of metal ribbed and lined with a veneer, affording an air pocket of about 4 or 6 inches between the metal and the veneer. The back doors were also metal, veneered inside and were solid.</p>

Front Street, in Philadelphia, and the driver reported with the first shipment at Bickley’s Philadelphia platform at 407 Callowhill Street, Philadelphia, at about 4:30 P. M. and was instructed by Mr. Bickley to take the loaded truck to Bickley’s garage at Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. The cases were taken from the platform of the Mushroom Transportation Company in Philadelphia about 4:30 P. M. on January 6th. It is only about a five minute drive from Mushroom Transportation Company’s platform to BicHeys. The drive to Jenkintown garage takes about 35 minutes. Mr. Bickley testified that it was too late to make the same day delivery, so the truck was sent to Bickley’s Jenkintown garage, where it arrived at about 5:30 o’clock P. M. and was kept there overnight. The truck was a panel body closed truck, with a solid top and the rear was closed by a slotted gate over which a tarpaulin was drawn. The garage at Jenkintown was constructed of stone and brick with a capacity of about 10 trucks, and is equipped with one door on each side by which it may be closed. Thé walls are 18 inches thick. It is an enclosed garage. It is not heated.</p>

The bill of lading provided that each carrier “. . . agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its own road . . . otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.” When Mushroom brought the shipments to its terminal in Philadelphia, it was required, by the contract, to deliver them to “another carrier on the route to said destination.” To comply with that obligation, Mushroom delivered them to the other defendant, William Bickley, trading as Biekley’s Auto Express, a carrier who delivered at North Wales. The learned judge was therefore right in holding that Bickley’s Auto Express was not performing a mere switching service but was participating in the line haul as delivering carrier: 49 USCA section 20(11).</p>

Plaintiff had placed on each box stickers or labels stating, “This Box Contains Live Plants, — Highly Perishable, — Must Be Kept From Extreme Heat or Cold, — Easily Frozen, — Transfer Points Please Protect From Extreme Heat or Cold.” Each also contained a sticker containing the words, “Perishable!

The consignor and the consignee were bound by the tariffs; the regulation against unlawful discrimination prohibited the carriers from rendering service not provided for in the tariffs. The evidence supports the faet, implicit in the conclusion of the learned judge, that defendants omitted nothing, provided for by their tariffs, that would prevent subjecting the plants “to extreme heat or cold,” while in transit or at rest. The evidence is that in defendant’s Rochester terminal, they were kept at an appropriate place until loaded into the truck for transportation. The <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>fact that the shipment went forward in two parts, instead of at the same time, apparently had nothing to do with its freezing because both shipments, though transported a day apart, were frozen when delivered at des-, tination. If anything, the inference from the division of the consignment and its shipment in two parts on successive days on both of which the plants froze, would be that the transportation in unheated vehicles during the low temperature prevailing and to be expected at that time of the year was an error of judgment on the part of the shipper. The stop at Williamsport for refueling, etc., was a contemplated necessity of the transportation and not inconsistent with defendant’s obligation. The time taken for their transfer, at the Philadelphia terminus, to Bickley for transportation to North Wales, was not unreasonable as is implied in the learned judge’s conclusion. Bickley had no night delivery service and therefore took the shipment to his. garage at Jenkintown, about one-third the distance to North Wales, where they were kept in the closed truck in a closed garage which constituted his terminal station.
