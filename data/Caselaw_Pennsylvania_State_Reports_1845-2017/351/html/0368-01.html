His next of kin are two brothers, residing' in the United States. One of them, born in 1870, has no descendants; the other, born in 1880, has four children.

This will contained no residuary clause and no reference to his wife. On February 3, 1941, he made a codicil, written in French by a Swiss scrivener, disposing of the residue of his estate not dispossed. of in the Will of November 20,1940. This codicil contains a clause about the meaning of which the parties differ: The question is whether the testator made a gift to his wife or whether, without making such a gift, he merely left her to the exercise of such right or rights as the law gave her.</p>

The ancillary administrator then filed its petition in Court of Common Pleas No. 1 alleging the incompetency of Elsa Treumann Harris, her guardianship in Switzerland; that testator left real property in Philadelphia and applied for the appointment of an ancillary guardian to care for Mrs. Harris’ property in Pennsylvania. The court appointed the Provident Trust Company of Philadelphia to be ancillary guardian of her estate. The ancillary guardian then filed its petition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in Court of Common Pleas No. 1 stating that testator’s widow had a limited time under the statute in which to elect to take against the will and desiring instructions <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> whether or not to elect on behalf of its ward.

A petition was therefore filed in the Orphans’ Court by the ancillary guardian praying for a declaratory judgment “construing the rights and inter<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>est of the ward of tbe petitioner under the will and codicil of Alan Campbell Harris, deceased”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> A joint answer was filed by testator’s brothers, contending that the codicil did “not constitute a gift or legacy or bequest or devise to his wife”, and that, on the contrary, he gave his entire estate to them as next of kin and heirs at law. After argument on petition and answer, the Orphans’ Court entered a declaratory judgment to the effect that testator had made a bequest and devise to Elsa Treumann Harris. Testator’s brothers appealed from that judgment (Nos. 283 and 284, January Term, 1944) and this appeal is now also before us.</p>

Powers, who died in 1878, domiciled in Philadelphia, leaving a will probated in Philadelphia. This trust is being administered by the Girard Trust Company. An account filed in the Orphans’ Court by the Girard Trust Company, surviving <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>trustee of the estate of Thomas H. Powers, deceased, and awaiting audit, shows that the net worth of the principal of the trust is $6,835,000, invested in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania securities, personalty and realty. Thomas H. Powers provided that the trust should terminate and distribution be made twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of his grandchildren living at the time of his death. In that trust, on the death of his mother oh August 30,1921, the testator, Alan Campbell Harris, acquired a vested equitable interest in an undivided one-third part of the corpus, subject to an executory limitation <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> on a contingency to be stated, requiring the payment of income to his widow for life in the amount of one-half the income of the third part of the trust. From his interest in this trust, Alan Campbell Harris had been receiving income, at or about the time of his death, at the rate of about $60,000 a year. The contingency referred to above results from the provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> that if any of Thomas H. Powers’ grandchildren die without issue and without malting testamentary provision for his or her surviving spouse, the trustee shall pay to such surviving spouse for life, out of the the trust income, an <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>amount equal to one-half the income theretofore-payable to such grandchild.

      <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>We must reject the construction suggested by the learned court below. The codicil begins with testator’s election to have the law of his country applied. He then referred, in the first line of paragraph 2 (by the words “Unless I have otherwise disposed”) to the fact that he had not disposed of his entire estate by his will. He then proceeded in the same sentence to dispose of the entire residue by describing it as “my whole succession”. This “whole succession”, he declares, “is to go entirely to my relatives”, etc. (according to one translation), and according to the other, “shall revert entirely to my relatives”, etc. If he had stopped there, it must have been conceded, that he had given his brothers all his property. He then continued the sentence by saying, “it being understood” that his wife had some right or rights by “the successional law” or “the estate law” of his country. This is nothing more than a recognition by him of the existence of such rights. As the learned court below has read a different meaning out of the clause, we must resolve the uncertainty by the aid of rules of construction. The question of construction then becomes: How is the clearly stated, absolute gift to his brothers of the entire residue to be affected by the uncertainty and ambiguity of the next clause in the same sentence? The rule is that a testator may by words, standing alone, give an absolute estate and then, by subsequent words, may cut down that absolute estate, but such a reduction in quantum may be made only by words clearly and unambiguously requiring that result: <em>Chestnut v.

It is significant that he did not; and still more significant that the prior provision that his “whole succession” his “whole estate” “is to go entirely to my relatives”, etc., shows that he did not intend to make such a gift to his wife.

The testator gave his wife such portion of his estate as “is required by Pennsylvania law but not more”. The meaning of those words was made clear by other provisions in the same will, as reference to the original record will show; the gift to his wife was followed by a gift to his brother of the balance remaining after deducting the gifts previously made to his wife and another. The intention to make a gift measured by the extent of the right which she might exercise was thus clearly expressed in the will. These and similar cases are of no assistance in resolving the uncertainty and ambiguity of the parenthetical clause in the codicil now under consideration.</p>

Testator’s interest in the trust estate, said to be valued at over $2,000,000.00 is subject to inheritance and estate taxes in a very large amount. If his widow receives the income under the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>conditional gift of the grandfather, she will receive a large income from that trust — one-half of what her husband had been receiving. As his grandfather died in 1878, testator would assume that this benefit to his widow would not be subject to estate taxes not at that time in existence. As she is now 76 years old, she can never, by taking against the will, enjoy the trust principal not distributable until 21 years after the death of her husband’s brother. Testator was thus confronted Avith the problem (1) of giving her half his estate by will subject to an estate tax burden that might leave nothing payable to her for the years during which it was necessary to obtain out of the trust the funds to meet the estate tax burden, or (2) of refraining from making a gift and thereby allowing her at once to receive the grandfather’s gift of one-half the annual income of testator’s interest in the trust created by the grandfather. ' Altogether apart from the result of the analysis of the codicil made earlier in this opinion conclusively showing that no gift was made to the widow, we cannot believe that the testator, confronted with those alternatives presented by the tax situation, intended, by the words of the parenthetical clause, to leave his widow without income from his or his grandfather’s property for any. considerable period; on the contrary, we think he intended by what he said, to make no gift to his widow and that, in any event, he would have refrained from doing so for the very purpose of enabling her immediately to receive the income provided by the grandfather’s will.</p>

It is exclusively for the court, which is the real guardian of the incompetent, to determine whether such an election should be made, and well defined principles have been laid down as guides for the exercise of its discretionary power. Chief among these is that the leaning of the law is toward the will : <em>Kennedy v.

The reason for this doctrine is that thé intentions of a testator should not be defeated, "unnecessarily, by judicial action, for every person, generally speaking, has the right to dispose of his estate according to his own wishes and therefore his will should'be upheld as far as possible. It is common knowledge that not every widow disregards her husband’s last wishes for the disposition of his property merely because she would obtain a greater quantum of his estate by so doing; sentiment enters into such situations quite as much as considerations of material advantage, and, if she is reasonably provided for in her husband’s will or her' wants are otherwise adequately supplied, it does not follow, just because such provision may not be as much as she might elect,'that she would file an election to take against his will. Therefore, when the court acts on behalf of a mentally defective widow it should not be controlled by mere mathematical calculations of the financial results that would accrue to her one way or the other.!</p>

An election to take against the will in this case would not only divert property owned absolutely by her husband, which for convenience may be designated as his estate, but would also divert a large interest in the corpus of the trust created by Thomas H. Powers which, for present purposes may be referred to as the grandfather’s estate. If an election to take against the will were authorized, the widow would thereby obtain one-half of her husband’s estate, such half having a value of approximately $360,000, and she would also become entitled to an annual income for life of about $30,000, that being half of what he had been receiving from the grandfather’s estate and to a half share of his vested interest in the principal of that estate, such half having a value of approximately $1,-140,000 but not receivable by her because not distributable <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> until the termination of the trust twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of her husband’s brothers. All this property would be subject to estate taxes that would quite certainly absorb the $360,000 and materially reduce the annual income from the trust. As she would not live to enjoy any part of the principal <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>of the grandfather’s ultimately distributable estate, it is obvious that all that could be obtained for her own benefit by taking against the will, would be half the annual income received by her husband, reduced, as has been said, by the taxes payable out of her husband’s estate. On the other hand she is more than well provided for by not taking against the will. She has $70,000 in principal; receives $4,100 a year in income from trusts created by her husband’s relatives, and will receive the annual income (perhaps $30,000) from that portion of the grandfather’s estate vested in her husband subject to the conditional limitation.</p>

The primary consideration is the current welfare of the incompetent herself, and the court’s discretion in the matter must be so exercised as to serve that purpose. Of course, if it were necessary, in order to assure the incompetent of sufficient income adequately to care for her, to elect to take against her husband’s will, the court would so direct, notwithstanding that as a consequence thereof some benefit would accrue to her next of kin on her death. However, if adequate provision for the incompetent is made either by the will or there are other sources of assured income for the incompetent, the court may not properly direct the guardian to take against the will, which would result in diverting a part of the principal estate to strangers of the blood of the testator.

We would be no more justified in <em>so </em>interpreting what this testator wrote than we would be justified in interpreting as a <em>bequest </em>to the United States of America and to Pennsylvania the following if it had been found in the testator’s codicil: “My whole estate not otherwise disposed of shall revert entirely to my relatives in the United States of America, it being understood by me that my estate is compelled to pay certain inheritance taxes to the governments of both the United States and of Pennsylvania.” A testator who makes a <em>bequest </em>must make it “animo testandi,” that is, with a deliberate intention to make it.

While I find this intent in <em>the words used </em>(where testamentary intent <em>must </em>be found, if possible), such an intent was also a <em>reasonable </em>one under the circumstances.

Neither the testator nor his wife had any children. <em>As long as she lived and until her husband should provide for her in his will, </em>she was in possession of a $30,000 annuity from the estate of her husband’s grandfather.

That the widow’s <em>kindred </em>would ultimately be enriched by permitting this widow’s guardian to take against the husband’s will was a consideration to which the court which had the guardian’s request before it properly refused to give any weight.

I agree that “the codicil does not disinherit the widow,” but I am equally certain that it does not “inherit” her.

As testator substituted Pennsylvania law for Swiss law, I can attribute no other meaning to his words than a plain and unequivocal gift, of a Pennsylvania intestate share of the residue to his widow. This construction coincides with the unanimous opinion of the six judges of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County. Had this view been adopted, all further considerations would have been moot.</p>

By his will testator passed to his widow a statutory share <em>under the Swiss law. </em>To take away from the widow her commensurate share, as measured by the substituted Pennsylvania Intestate Act, .requires more than a <em>supposed ambiguity. </em>It cannot be done by inference or surmise. Plainly expressed, unequivocal terms are required. The correct statement of the law, which is applicable by analogy, is found in the majority’s opinion: “The rule is that a testator may by words, standing alone, give an absolute estate and then, by subsequent words, may cut down that absolute estate, <em>but such a reduction in quantum may be made only by words clearly and unambiguously requiring that result” </em>(italics mine).</p>

    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[244,1391,1151,867]]]'>An attempt is made to create an ambiguity because of the Use of the words “compulsory portion”. There appears to be but slight difference between: the Pennsylvania and Swiss statutes. The Pennsylvania <em>Intestate Act </em>prescribes the measure of the intestate shares. These are obligatory and may not be increased or diminished. Under the <em>Wills Act, </em>a surviving spouse may elect to take her intestate share in lieu of the share provided for her by the will.- In Switzerland, however, -the statutory share passes to the widow regardless of testacy or intestacy. It seems most clear that this testator realized that under Pennsylvania law his widow could always demand her intestate rights and therefore regarded such share as “compulsory”. Regarding the will as a whole, any distinction in-terms appears most narrow. It certainly does not support the assertion of ambiguity.</p>

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>I. am unable to comprehend the involved reasoning of the majority, whereby the testamentary words are construed to <em>imply </em>testator’s intent to give his wife <em>nothing </em>and at the same time to indicate his supposed knowledge that his widow could elect to take against the will. There is nothing in these writings which even remotely suggests such an idea. The majority seat themselves in testator’s mythical “arm chair” to seek out the surrounding facts and circumstances under which the writings were executed as an aid to their interpretation. After considering the extent of testator’s estate, his family, the wills of his grandfather and mother, taxes, income and many other matters, there is attributed to this sick, aged testator “pinched with the messengers of death”, supposed intent relating to matters which, I am positive, from their very statement, testator never considered, or of which he was even capable of remotely comprehending. Indeed, concerning testator’s supposed knowledge of the <em>tax </em>situation, contrary to what appears in the opinion, counsel for the next of kin frankly concedes in his supplemental brief “. . . <em>it would be unreasonable to assume that </em>[testator] <em>had in mind the correct solution of all these difficult tax problems.”</em>

To my mind the action of the common pleas court was a flagrant abuse of judicial discretion. The law has long since emerged from the ancient conception that a married woman was a chattel and could be dismissed by the formality of handing her a slipper. The marriage relation vests in the wife a statutory interest in her husband’s real and personal property. Her property rights, once acquired, have always been pro<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>tected and defended by the courts. In early times a widow even possessed the “right of quarantine”, a right secured to her by Magna Charta, Cap. 7, which permitted her to tarry in the chief house of her husband for forty days until her dower rights were assigned to her Co. Litt. 32b, 34b. A mentally competent widow may freely elect to take against her deceased spouse’s will. It is a personal decision, not subject to judicial supervision. But widows frequently acquiesce in the terms of their husband’s wills, even though they could have received larger portions under the intestate laws. It is this underlying consideration which is the basis of the requirement that a legal representative of a <em>mentally incompetent </em>widow must secure the court’s permission to elect in her behalf. I agree with the majority and the cases they cite in support of this principle. It is well stated by Judge Htjntek in his Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Commonplace Book, Vol. 1, page 354: “The right of a committee in lunacy to take against a will is not absolute but is within the sound discretion of the court having control of the lunatic’s estate; the leaning of the law is in favor of the will, particularly where a taking against it would divert the estate of the deceased from his own blood; where the individual estate of the lunatic and that bequeathed to her are ample for her needs, leave to elect to take against the will will be denied.”</p>
    <p id="b431-4" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[228,1680,1147,692]]]'>It is to be observed that this statement couples with the sufficiency of the individual estate of the wife the requirement: <em>“and that bequeathed to her". </em>In every case cited by the majority the testator had, by his will, <em>made adequate provision </em>for his widow in a measure almost equivalent to her statutory intestate share. In none of the cases was the widow disinherited. But in no reported case which I have discovered, has this principle been applied to allow a widow to be disinherited because she possessed an individual estate of her own, was old, insane and therefore would not be able to enjoy it. Such considerations are, to my mind, wholly unsound and untenable.</p>

      <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>An illustration of .the <em>application </em>of this principle may be shown in the facts of this case. Suppose this Court had construed the will to pass 375,000 francs to legatees and an intestate share in the residue to the incompetent widow. A valid election to take against the will would entitle.the widow to receive:such interest as ■she would have taken had her husband died intestate. Thus, she would take a <em>full </em>one-half. The 375j000 francs legacies would-then be payable out of the other intestate share. See cases cited in Judge OHuntee’s-Commonplace Book, supra, Yol. 1, section 12, page 355, et seq. It is highly probable that with an. estate of this size, where testator by his will had amply provided for his wife, the court, would refuse permission to the guardian of the incompetent'widow to elect.to take against the will, for the sole purpose of increasing the widow’s estate to the extent of one-half of the amount of the legacies,-a gain in dollars, of even as much' as $45,000.</p>

In the facts of this case, I most emphatically do not agree that-it is for the <em>“welfare of the widow, the main object of . . . consideration”, </em>that she should be denied her intestate share; The assigned reasons-for the exercise of the discretion by the -common pleas court denying the guardian the right to elect are in.two classes: (1) what the widow will receive from the , testator’s grandfather’s will in case she is disinherited, and (2) what it will-cost her in taxes, if she rejects-the -will (as interpreted) and takes her intestate share.</p>

This, of course, would be $30,000. But-it'is also stated that there will be a probable -federal estate tax of $940,300 payable. Counsel for the widow contends that such fed<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>eral tax will considerably reduce that income,, which is denied by the counsel for the next of kin.

Counsel for the widow argues. to the contrary. ■ Elaborate briefs have been submitted, with highly technical tax calculations. It is apparent that the federal tax question is subject to a wide divergence of opinions. I do not think this Court should essay to pass upon such federal tax matters. Realizing the extremely complicated state of the tax law and tax regulations, I would prefer to allow the responsibility of deciding what was best for the widow to rest with her capable representatives and not be influenced by the arguments of the next of kin who will receive the whole estate to her exclusion.</p>

They brush away the rights of the widow because she is seventy-six years of age, insane, and with a life expectancy, at best, of few years; because her wants, relatively small, are sufficiently supplied by her own estate and by her husband’s relatives; and because her income might be augmented, in an uncertain amount, if her husband disinherits her.
