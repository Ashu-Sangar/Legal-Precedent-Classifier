    <p id="b297-4" data-blocks='[["BL_297.8",297,[193,586,1153,1356]]]'>The Secretary of Banking took possession of Pittsburgh-American Bank and Trust Company on September 25, 1981. On November 18, 1931, he determined, as Receiver, to liquidate its business and property. On February 1, 1939, he decided to enforce the additional statutory liability of the stockholders for the debts of the bank and gave written notice of assessment and demand for payment on or before March 6,1939. On October 1, 1941, he brought this suit in assumpsit against one of the stockholders who had failed to pay the assessment. The action was defended on the ground that the period from September 25, 1931, the date of the closing of the bank, to March 15, 1933, the date of the filing of the Receiver’s first and partial account, constituted a sufficient time within which he should have made his assessment and demand and that therefore the Statute of Limitations began to run more than six years before the commencement of this action. Defendant set forth as “new matter” the various appraisements of assets and statements of liabilities filed from time to time, all of which showed such an excess of liabilities over appraised value of assets that, it is alleged, it should have been clear to the Receiver almost from the beginning that enforcement of the additional statutory liability of the stockholders would be necessary.</p>

In that case the defendant set up as a defense the bar of the Statute because of the Receiver’s failure to make demand within a reasonable time after he knew or should have known that the assets would be insufficient to pay the creditors in full and that an assessment against the stockholders would therefore be necessary. However, that defense, although urged in the brief of an amicus curiae, was not listed by the defendant as one of the questions on appeal, and what was decided was merely that the claim of the Receiver was not barred because of his failure to make the assessment <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>within six years of the time when he entered into possession of the bank and. determined to liquidate its affairs. • ■</p>

The question was there flatly raised — indeed it was the only question submitted on appeal — whether the action was barred by delay, eleven years having elapsed between the time when possession of the bank was taken by the Receiver and the time when he made demand for payment of the balance due on the stock. It was held that while, as previously stated, the rule in such cases was the same as in those to enforce the additional statutory liability, namely, that the Statute runs only from the time when an assessment or demand is made, a further principle was applicable which prescribed that where the time of making a demand is within the control of the plaintiff it must be made within a reasonable time, this being a rule applicable generally to contracts. Accordingly, the court below was directed to hear evidence and determine whether demand had been made within such time and, if not, when the running of the Statute properly began.</p>

Some of the defendants filed preliminary objections to the bill on the ground that it disclosed laches and that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations because the Secretary’s demand was made more than six years after he took possession of the bank in question. This court said: “Only by presentation and.consideration of all the pertinent facts and circumstances at the trial of the cause can the question be satisfactorily determined. The case is not sufficiently clear on the face of the bill to justify.a summary decree. Defendants should therefore be ■ required to answer the bill of complaint and the cause be allowed to proceed to a hearing.” However, this court also said ¿t page 670: “. . . while the statute ordinarily runs from the making of a demand where such demand is necessary to furnish a cause of action, there is a further rule which prescribes that where the time of demand is within the control of the plaintiff the demand must be made <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>
      <em>within a reasonable time. </em>The statute cannot be extended by the plaintiff’s act or failure to act; he cannot arrest the running of the statute by his own negligence or for his own convenience. This principle has been established in Pennsylvania by a great current of authorities which have applied it under various circumstances.” In the footnote were cited several cases allegedly in support of the principles thus stated. We said elsewhere in the opinion that “what constitutes a reasonable time depends on the circumstances of the particular case.”</p>

The cases cited in support of the dicta are wholly inapplicable in a suit by a Secretary of Banking .against stockholders of closed banks. “The rule that where a plaintiff’s cause of action depends upon some act to be performed by him preliminary to commencing suit, and he is under no restraint or disability in the performance of such act, he cannot indefinitely suspend the running of the statute of limitations by delaying the performance of the preliminary act” has no application to a case of this kind where the liability and procedure are determined by statute. The section of the Banking Code applicable to this and similar cases is Sec. 723 of Art. YII of the Act of May 15,1933, P. L. 565 (71 P. S., Sec. 733-723), which provides as follows: “If at any time after he takes possession of a corporation as receiver, <em>it shall appear to the secretary </em>that the assets of such corporation will be insufficient to pay in full its debts to depositors and other creditors, <em>he shall, as soon as </em>expedient, <em>estimate </em>the amount which shall be assessed against all shareholders who are, under these circumstances, personally liable for any part of the debts of such corporation, by reason of their ownership of such shares. He shall assess against such shareholders the amount which he then deems necessary for the payment of such debts, not however exceeding the maximum liability of such shareholders, as provided by law.” (Italics supplied.]</p>

The receiver instituted suit against stockholder Wainwright <em>more than 6 years </em>from the date of insolvency but less than 6 years from the date when it was judicially ascertained (under the practice then applicable) that the bank’s assets were insufficient to pay its debts.

The number of suits commenced in Pénnsylvania against stockholders of closed banks to collect unpaid assessments on their stock is <em>8,115. </em>There are <em>44 </em>similar suits pending against stockholders in suits outside of Pennsylvania. For the Secretary of Banking to be called upon to justify before juries his more than six years delay in making assessments against shareholders of closed banks in every one of the thousands of cases he has so delayed for presumably good and sufficient reasons would be to place an intolerable burden ;upon that official and would in a large measure paralyze the liquidation of closed banks. It would be likely to happen that different juries in suits against the sharéholders of even the same bank would reach different conclusions as to the reasonableness of the Secretary’s delay. Juries in suits in outside states against non-Pennsylvania shareholders of closed Pennsylvania banks would be quite likely to make findings in favor of the defendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">2</a>
