L. 415, as amended by Act of 1941, P. L. 821, 20 PS section 1961 (Supp.) ? The learned court below, on preliminary motion, decided that petitioner was entitled to contest. While no appeal was taken from such decision and it was not assigned as error, at the oral argument we questioned petitioner’s status. We have considered the question and have concluded that the ruling of the learned court below was correct. While there appear to be no direct appellate decisions upon the question in this Commonwealth, the matter was inferentially ruled upon in <em>Curtis’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/253/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="253 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1024030" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0389-01">253 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20575" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="98 A. 575">98 A. 575</a>. An examination of the opinion and the record in that case discloses that decedent, when fully competent, <em>destroyed </em>the prior will under which contestant claimed. <em>,Because of this fact, </em>even though the questioned will might thereafter have been declared invalid, contestant wpuld have received nothing from the estate. He was thus precluded by the court from contesting the probated will. The resulting implication is that contestant would have been considered a party in interest had the prior will been extant. Contrary to the factual situation in the <em>Curtis </em>case, this petitioner is a legatee not only in the mutual or reciprocal will of decedent and her husband, but in several of the intervening executed wills. Should this will be declared invalid, contestant’s interest would appear under one or more of the other wills offered in evidence. See also: <em>Montgomery v.

There is nothing in tbe record which even remotely indicates that proponents undertook to establish tbe execution of tbe will de novo. Proponents having thus established a prima facie case in support of tbe will, tbe burden of proof temporarily shifted to contestant. Mr. Justice Steen said in <em>Szmahl's Estate, </em>supra, page 92: “Tbe purpose of allowing tbe probate of tbe will to be placed in evidence is merely to establish a prima facie status, and affects only tbe order of proof. Such practice is justified by tbe fact that *a register is a judge, and tbe admission of a will to probate is a judicial act’: <em>Sebik’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/300/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="300 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1125955" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0045-01">300 Pa. 45</a>, 47; <em>West v.

Tbe acceptance in evidence of tbe probate merely shifts to contestants temporarily tbe duty to come forward with evidence, but tbe proceeding remains at all times a bearing de novo. It is not uncommon in legal procedure for an ultimate burden of proof to rest upon one party throughout, but for tbe burden of coming forward with evidence to pass back and forth from one side to tbe other. If no testimony is offered other than tbe probate of tbe will itself, tbe legal result obviously should be, as tbe court below decided in tbe present case, that tbe probate is not impeached and must be accepted as conclusive, just as if there bad been no appeal.”</p>

Ash, the decedent, a childless widow, died April 25, 1940, at the age of 79 years. Her estate amounted to approximately $40,000. She left a will dated October 11, 1939, which was duly probated, and from which this appeal is taken. Decedent’s sole next of kin is a brother who was not made a party to this contest. By the will decedent bequeathed legacies totalling $3,500 to charities, $3,600 to named individuals and made specific bequests of the household furniture. The residue was left to four of the proponents, whose status, <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>as relates to decedent, was that of attending physician, attending professional nurse, caretaker, and “lawyer”, in reality a bond salesman. The pastor of the appellant church testified, solely from hearsay, that decedent suffered from a cardiac and circulatory condition, which was progressive. There was no evidence of the physical and mental condition of decedent at the time of the execution of the will. The minister testified that her condition of mind was “foggy”, but qualified his description as “. . . that which is usually with a senile person.” A discharged housekeeper testified that she thought decedent had “funny” ideas because she wanted to refurnish her home and because she tied rings on her fingers with colored ribbons. Charles H. Kreamer, a co-executor of the will, and a member of the contesting church, testified. He was the local bank president, attorney in fact of decedent and looked after her affairs generally. He knew nothing of the present will until after the death and was naturally suspicious of the nature of the testamentary disposition of the residue. He testified that he did not believe that decedent was of sound mind. His impressions were formed because he believed decedent had erroneous ideas concerning the extent of her wealth. He counseled against unwise expenditures. On the other hand, as attorney in fact, he drew and signed checks in amounts varying from $15 to $1000 as gifts to various parties, including some of the residuary legatees, <em>solely because of decedent’s directions. </em>All of these checks were given within four months of the execution of the will, and two of the largest within one month thereof. Another significant fact was that this witness, at the direction of decedent, drew a check for $7500 to contestant to pay for a memorial chancel and pipe organ. The record is not definite as to when the payment was made, but the installation was during the months of August and September 1939 and the dedication service was held September 3, 1939 (a month before the execution of the will). Decedent attended the dedication ceremonies, al<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>though she was feeble and required assistance. It is also significant to note that Kreamer approved of the purchase by decedent of a fur coat and an automobile. In short, this witness, despite his expressed view that decedent suffered from impaired mentality, nevertheless followed her directions as to financial, expenditures.</p>
