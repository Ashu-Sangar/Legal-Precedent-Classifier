    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[220,1037,1148,315]]]'>The school now has a staff of 74 teachers and an enrollment of 366 pupils. In 1939 it purchased a large residential property in Devon, Easttown Township, Chester County, containing approximately 14 acres of land.

    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[218,1363,1151,975]],["BL_511.1",511,[216,262,1149,481]]]'>On August 6, 1940, Easttown Township, in pursuance of the authority granted by the Act of July 1,1937, P. L. 2624, adopted a zoning ordinance under which the “Academy” was included within an “A residence District” ; however, as this property was already in use by the Foundation, it was not affected by the restrictions imposed by the ordinance. The ordinance provided that in an “A residence District” a building might be used, inter alia, for an “educational or religious use, including dormitory of an educational institution, but excluding cemeteries, hospital, homes, sanitarium, correctional institution or structure or other place for accommodating the insane or other persons mentally deficient, weak or abnormal, except as provided in Article X.” Article X, thus referred to, provided that the Board of Adjustment should have the power “. . .

    <p id="b511-3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[211,757,1153,1293]]]'>In 1943 the Foundation purchased an additional tract known as the “Ilsley” property, consisting of a private residence and 4 acres of land, all included within the same road boundaries as the “Academy” and the same “A residence District” under the ordinance. The Foundation intended to use this property, not for educational work, but as a dormitory for boys. It applied for a certificate of occupancy, which application was denied by the Zoning Administrative Officer of the township. Upon appeal to the Board of Adjustment that body, after hearing testimony, found that the contemplated use of the property was a violation of the terms of the ordinance but that “the circumstances of this case warrant the granting of an exception which is hereby allowed,” and accordingly directed that an occupancy permit be issued. Thereupon residents of the District who had appeared before the Board of Adjustment in opposition to the application appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. The court supported the conclusion of the Board that the proposed use of the property was prohibited by the ordinance, but overruled the action of the Board in granting an exception. The Foundation now appeals from that order of the court.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[211,2071,1148,255]],["BL_512.1",512,[211,268,1152,2066]],["BL_513.1",513,[220,271,1149,319]]]'>As above stated, the ordinance sanctions an educational use, “including dormitory of an educational institution”, but bars a “structure or other place for accommodating . . . persons mentally deficient, weak or abnormal.” That the Devereux Foundation .is an educa<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>tional institution, and a very splendid one, is admitted by the appellees, and therefore a dormitory for its pupils would seem to come within the express inclusion of the ordinance. On the other hand, both the Board of Adjustment and the Court of Common Pleas found as a fact that the pupils of the Foundation who would live in the dormitory were “mentally deficient, weak or abnormal” persons, and in that finding we concur in spite of the subtle distinctions sought to be made by appellant between various degrees of mentality, normal, abnormal and sub-normal; the testimony indicates that the students include neurotics, epileptics and other victims of psychopathic disorders. Nor can it be doubted that the proposed dormitory, whatever may be said as to others of the school buildings, is a place for “accommodating” its occupants, since its sole purpose is to supply them with shelter, ease and comfort in the same manner as a hotel is said to “accommodate” its patrons. The fact that they may be receiving education on an adjoining tract of land belonging to the Foundation is, in this regard, wholly immaterial. Reconciling, then, the inclusive and the exclusive provisions of the ordinance, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the “dormitory of an educational institution” must have been intended to refer to such a dormitory as is devoted to the accommodation of normal students ordinarily attending the usual type of educational institutions, and that the exclusion of a structure for accommodating mentally deficient or abnormal persons was intended to override the permissive provision if, as here, the two came into conflict. The Foundation contends that this interpretation creates an invalid discrimination between a dormitory of this school and those of other schools, public and private, all of which probably contain some pupils who are mentally retarded or deficient. But as Mr. Justice Holmes so frequently pointed out, most of the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree, and there is a marked practical difference, justifying a <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>legal differentiation, between the dormitory of a school all of whose occupants are, from the standpoint of mentality, of the problem type which it is the very purpose and function of the institution to serve, and the dormitory of a school in which only a negligible percentage of the occupants are mentally sub-normal.</p>
    <p id="b513-3" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[220,600,1152,1520]]]'>We come to the question whether the Board of Adjustment was warranted in granting what it terms an “exception”, and on that basis permitting the issuance of the certificate of occupancy requested by the Foundation. The Act of July 1, 1937, P. L. 2624, which authorizes townships of the second class to adopt and enforce zoning ordinances, provides in Section 7 that the board of township supervisors may appoint a board of adjustment and may provide that “said board of adjustment may in appropriate cases, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance in harmony with its general purpose and intent and in accordance with the general or specific rules therein contained.” As far as the terms of the Easttown Township ordinance appear in the record there are no rules therein contained in accordance with which special exceptions may be made. An “exception” in a zoning ordinance is one allowable where facts and conditions detailed in the ordinance, as those upon which an exception may be permitted, are found to exist. But zoning ordinances usually provide, as does the present one, for another kind of dispensation, also permitted by the statute, by which a “variance” from the terms of the ordinance may be authorized in cases where a literal enforcement of its provisions would result in unnecessary hardship. Presumably, therefore, it is such a variance which the Board of Adjustment intended here to authorize.</p>

Superior Ct. 543</a>, 546, the late, lamented Judge Kellek said: “The authority thus placed in the Board is not an arbitrary one. The discretion vested in the Board is subject, to review if abused or not exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

No other considerations should enter into the decision.” This case was cited, and the principle which it enunciated was followed, in Appeal of <em>Heman Johnson, </em><a href="/pa-super/93/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="93 Pa.

It is true that ordinarily the grant or the refusal by the Board of Adjustment of a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance should not be reversed unless its action was “a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion”: <em>Jennings’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/330/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="330 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1182961" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0154-01">330 Pa. 154</a>, 157, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20621" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="198 A. 621">198 A. 621</a>, <em>622; Perelman v.

But we agree with the court below that in this case the Board of Adjustment did abuse its discretion in allowing a so-called “exception” or variance, for there was no evidence to support such a grant. It is of some significance that the Board did not state facts or advance reasons for its action. Mere hardship is not sufficient; there must be <em>unnecessary </em>hardship, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>the Foundation will be subject to such hardship by denial of the right to use the Ilsley property as a dormitory for its pupils. It bought the property with full knowledge of the terms of the ordinance, and certainly the mere curtailment of its ambition to expand its work over forbidden territory is not an unnecessary hardship within the statutory meaning of that phrase; to hold otherwise would be to nullify the entire purpose and effect of the zoning regulations. Moreover, the power given by the statute and by the ordinance to authorize a variance is limited by the provision that it must be such “as will not be contrary to the public interest”; this presumably is intended to insure protection of the interests of that portion of the public which is affected by the variance, namely, the owners and occupants of the neighboring properties. The objections raised by the latter cannot be dismissed as capricious or unduly selfish. While it is true that the Foundation will, in any event, continue to operate its school on the “Academy” property, it is natural that the creation of a dormitory on the Ilsley tract should arouse added apprehension among the neighbors, for the close presence of persons who are below the normal standards of mental capacity and are subject to psychological and psychiatric aberrations not only constitutes a depressing factor calculated to interfere with the enjoyment of home life but even involves the potential danger of physical disturbances.</p>

The power to authorize such a variance is to be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances, for otherwise there would be little left of the zoning law to protect public rights; prospective purchasers of property would hesitate if confronted by a tribunal which could arbitrarily set aside the zoning provisions designed to establish standards of occupancy in the neigh<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>borhood. Indeed, if such power were to be interpreted as a grant to the board of the right to amend or depart from the terms of the ordinance at its uncontrolled will and pleasure, it might well be challenged as being an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to a purely administrative tribunal.</p>

No children are accepted who need custodial care. Most of the pupils come and go, as they please, in their free time without chaperonage of anyone.

Sanity is a relative term at best.

The exclusion by a zoning ordinance of one educational institution and the inclusion of another on the basis of the mentality of their respective pupils must rest upon some “rational relation to the health and safety of the community”; it must bear a “substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare”.

At most, the protesting property owners objected to the fact that the Devereux pupils walked along the roads of the locality, which they termed a “depressing” sight, and to the possible embarrassment of having to explain to their own children what was “wrong” with the Devereux pupils should the former see them and curiously inquire concerning them.

Educational or religious use, including dormitory of an educational institution, but excluding cemeteries, hospital, <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>homes, sanitarium, correctional institution or structure or other place for accommodating the insane or other persons mentally deficient, weak or abnormal, * *</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[206,432,1150,1837]]]'>Thus, the ordinance expressly permits the occupancy of a building for an educational use, including a dormitory in connection therewith, and then follows the exclusion of certain specified other uses. It is not apparent to me how the excluding clause can be thought to cut down the prior specific inclusion. In short, it is unreasonable to deduce from the ordinance an intention that would permit Devereux Foundation, for instance, to erect a building <em>anywhere </em>within the “A Residence District” <em>for educational purposes </em>and, yet, not allow it to house its pupils in that or any other building. The construction necessary in order to relate back to “dormitory of an educational institution” the subsequent exclusion of a “structure or other place for accommodating * * * persons mentally deficient, weak or abnormal”, not only seems patently unwarranted but, even if admissible, it should be discarded because of the constitutional frailty which it would impute to the ordinance, as already indicated. As between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, a court’s plain duty is to adopt that which will save the enactment. And, the rule is the same even where the necessity is no more than to avoid a serious doubt as to constitutionality. No extended- citation of authority is needed to support that rule.

In obedience to the authority last above cited, the Board, of course, should have made findings in support of the “exception”. But the fact that it did not do so does not seem to me to justify a reviewing court in saying in effect that the “circumstances” in the record <em>do not </em>warrant an “exception”. The most the court below should have done, in the absence of formal findings by the Board, was to return the matter to the Board for such relevant findings as the record justifies. That fundamental function is committed by law to the local administrative body. Unless that be respected, a reviewing court will become the zoning administrator which is not its province.- “If a court can * * * decide the factual question itself, the board will become more or less a useless formality.” <em>Perelman v.

The remaining four acres, likewise improved with a large modern dwelling (known as the Ilsley property) ¿ was purchased in 1943 by Devereux which desires to use it as a dormitory in connection with its school on the Welsh property. The ordinance having been enacted in 1940, an occupancy permit for the use of the latterly acquired property was required in ordinary course.</p>

Devereux can build all over the Welsh property (three-quarters of its whole tract) without let or hindrance from the zoning authorities, so long as the buildings are intended and used for school or incidental dormitory purposes. In fact, Devereux may even now, under the construction of the majority, use the Ilsley property for school purposes.
