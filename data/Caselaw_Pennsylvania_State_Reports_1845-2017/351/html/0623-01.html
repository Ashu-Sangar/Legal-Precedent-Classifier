Another was in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the proceeds of which were payable in stipulated monthly instalments to T. B. Moreland Porter. A third policy was in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the proceeds of which were to be left with the Company on deposit and interest paid thereon to Louise Porter Wampler, with the right on her part to withdraw $2,000 of the principal per annum, and at her death the balance was to be paid to the Union National Bank of Pittsburgh as trustee under an inter vivos trust created by decedent for the benefit of Louise Porter Wampler during her life and upon her death for her children.

This works an obvious hardship upon those who are usually the closest relatives of the decedent, especially where the tax covers property passing not only under his will but under inter vivos trusts, transfers taking effect at death, or the proceeds, as in the present case, of insurance policies and- annuity contracts. It was largely to relieve such situations that the Proration Act of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2762, was passed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> That act adds section- 48.1 to the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447. It provides that whenever an executor or administrator has paid an estate tax assessed under the Act of May 7, 1927, P. L..859, or any future law, or under the. provisions of any estate, tax law of the United-States, “the amount of the tax so paid, except in a case where a testator otherwise directs in his will, shall be equitably prorated among the persons interested an the estate to whom such property is or may be transferred, or to whom any benefit accrues. . . . For the purposes of this section, the term ‘persons interested in the estate’ shall,-with respect to both State and Federal taxes, include- all. persons who may be entitled to receive or who have received any property or interest which is required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent, or any benefit whatsoever with respect to any such property or interest, whether under a will or intestacy, . or by' reason, of any transfer, .trust, estate^ in<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>terest, right, power, or relinquishment of power, taxable under any of the aforementioned laws providing for the levy or assessment of estate taxes. The tax shall be paid by the executor, administrator, or other fiduciary as such out of the estate before its distribution. In all cases in which any property required to be included in the gross estate does not come into the possession of the executor, administrator or other fiduciary as such, he shall recover from whomever [sic] is in possession, or from the persons interested in the estate, the proportionate amount of such tax payable by the persons interested in the estate with which such' persons are chargeable under the provisions of this section, and the orphans’ court may, by order, direct the payment of. such amount of tax by such persons to the executor, administrator or other fiduciary. ... (b) The orphans’ court, upon making a determination as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, shall make a decree or order directing the executor, administrator or other fiduciary to charge the prorated amounts against the persons against whom the tax has been so prorated, in so far as he is in possession of property or interests of such persons against whom such charge may be made, and summarily directing all other persons against whom the tax has been so prorated, or who are in possession of property or interests of such persons, to make payment of such prorated amounts to such executor, administrator or other fiduciary.” . . ..</p>

Are these companies persons “interested in the estate ... or to whom any benefit accrues”? It <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>would seem.clear beyond peradventure that no.benefit accrued to them at the time of decedent’s death or in connection with his estate, and that they are not “persons interested in the estate” as defined in the act. The “beneficiaries” and the “persons interested in the estate” are the annuitants and the persons entitled to receive the proceeds of the insurance policies, for they are the ones who acquired property or interests in the estate at the time of decedent’s death. The only relation between an insurance company and the beneficiary of one of its policies is that of debtor and creditor, irrespective of whether the proceeds be payable entirely at once or in instalments. There is no fund segregated from the general assets of the company which constitutes a trust or establishes between the company and the beneficiary any relation of trustee and cestui que trust. Indeed, it is expressly provided by the Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, art. IY, §413, and the Act of May 17, 1919, P. L. 208, §1, as amended by the Act of April 26, 1923, P. L. 104, §1, that whenever, under the terms of any annuity or policy of life insurance, the proceeds are retained by the company at maturity or otherwise, it shall not be required to segregate such proceeds but may hold them as part of its general corporate funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus it is clear that these insurance companies are not in possession of any funds or property belonging to or acquired from decedent’s estate; occupying the status of debtors and not of beneficiaries they do not fall within the purview of the Proration Act. Nor does that act, as it might have done, make them withholding agents for the collection of the prorated portions of the tax; only, therefore, by legal process effecting a sequestration or attachment can the executor collect from them the amounts due from the <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>beneficiaries, and then only, of course, in such instalments, at such times, and in such manner as is stipulated in the policies; any compulsory acceleration of the payments would constitute an impairment of the obligation of the contracts. It follows that the court was without power to order a cancellation of the existing insurance and annuity certificates and the exchange therefor of new certificates containing other terms than those stipulated in the original obligations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

As far as the title is concerned, it designates the act as an addition to the Fiduciaries Act (the title of which states that it deals “generally” with “the jurisdiction, powers, and procedure of the orphans’ court, in all matters relating to fiduciaries concerned with the estates of decedents”) “by providing for the apportionment of estate taxes in certain cases”; this is sufficiently broad to include provisions concerning the tribunal, and the ways and means, by which such apportionment is to be made: <em>Orlosky v.
