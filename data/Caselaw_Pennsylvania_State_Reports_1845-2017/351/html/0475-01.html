    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[233,557,1153,865]],["BL_507.1",507,[197,271,1153,1465]]]'>On April 5, 1938, the Board of Commissioners of Upper Darby Township enacted and approved a Zoning Ordinance. Section 601 of the said Ordinance enumerates the purpose for which a building may be erected in what is known as R-4 Residence district. Section 1306 provides for non-conforming uses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Nicholas H. Berberian acquired the property in question on May 19, 1942, from Theodore Frantz, Jr., and Ida K., his wife. On the effective date of the Ordinance, Frantz used the buildings for the manufacture, repair, storage, and shipping of furniture as well as storage of trucks used in his business. This use continued until the death of Theodore Frantz, Jr., on September 9, 1941. On March 12, 1941, the central part of the building was partially destroyed by fire together with the roof of its south wing. The heating plant was also damaged. The trial judge found <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>as a fact, and the court below confirmed this finding, that as a result of the fire more than 75 per cent of the value of the central building was destroyed and more than 75 per cent of the buildings as a whole was destroyed. Appellant has been using the property since May, 1942, for the repair, shipping and delivery and storing of clothing and rugs which have been brought to him for cleaning and dyeing. He also uses the garage for storing trucks used to transport said merchandise. On January 29, 1943, the building inspector refused a permit to repair. This refusal was affirmed by the Board of Adjustment. The trial judge found as a fact that the present use of the property is in excess of that at the time of the enactment of the. Ordinance; that the present use of the property is objectionable because of noise; that the present use of the property has increased the noise, fire hazard and odors; that the present use is an extension of the use as it existed at the effective date of the Ordinance which use then constituted a non-conforming use, and that the present use by appellant is detrimental to the health and safety of the community. The trial judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Board of Adjustment refusing to direct the issuance of the building permit to repair the building. The court below dismissed appellant’s exceptions to the said findings and conclusions and affirmed the acr tion of the trial judge. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[196,1749,1150,425]]]'>Appellant contends that the proposed use does not differ so greatly from the former use that the non-conforming use privilege will not protect him; that there has been no extension or enlargement of the non-conforming use justifying refusal of the building permit; and, that there was no evidence to sustain the court’s finding that the building had been destroyed by fire to the extent of more than 75 per cent of its value.</p>
