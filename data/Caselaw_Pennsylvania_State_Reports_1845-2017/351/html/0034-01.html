Both parties have appealed, the plaintiff claiming a larger sum. Two insured accounts are in<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>volved, one referred to as the Leather account and the other as the Boyt account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The insurance was $25,000 on each account. The term was from January 17, 1930, to January 16,1931. In the Leather account (a conventional insolvency resulting from appointment of a creditors’ committee)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the dispute about the amount payable grows out of the fact that while the policy was applied for on May 17,1930, its coverage was in part retroactive, involving credit allowed between January 17,1930, and May 17,1930. The insurance premium was paid May 17, 1930. The policy provided, as a condition of antedating coverage, that “. . . only such sales, shipments and deliveries made prior to the payment of the premium for this policy shall be covered thereby as were made to debtors who were in sound financial condition at the time of the payment of said premium . . .” The purpose was to cover sales made in January, February and March, 1930. The learned judge found that Leather was in a sound financial condition when the premium was paid as required by the quoted condition; the defendant offered no evidence on the point in the trial now under review but challenges the finding as unsupported. The finding has the approval of the court in banc. Nothing has been called to our attention which would justify a reversal of that finding. On this account plaintiff received from the creditors’ committee 86%% of its claim and plaintiff’s only complaint is that it was charged collection fees. We must sustain this contention; they were not claimed by defendant in any of the three trials; the parties were competent to deal with the subject notwithstanding the policy provision and apparently did <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>so.

The learned judge held that the accounts due for the shipments of January, February and March were not covered and pro-rated the payments received on account, by applying a provision of the policy: “If the indebtedness of the debtor to the Insured at the time of the Insolvency is not covered in full by this Policy, then said deductions [‘all amounts collected thereon’ etc.] shall be made pro rata, viz.: in the ratio which the amount covered bears to the whole of such indebtedness . . .”</p>

These conditions began: “Insolvency Defined — The insolvency of a debtor for the purposes of this policy shall be deemed to have occurred when, during the term of this policy: (1) The Insured elects to and has filed with the Company for collection a claim against a debtor whose account is due and payable at the time of filing, but not over seventy (70) days past due under the original terms of sale; . . .” As we understand his adjudication, the learned judge rejected from coverage the January, February and March accounts because on January 12, 1931, when the notice was given, they were “past due” within the terms of that provision.</p>

It is significant that there is no requirement that he must do so. If the intention had been to require a declaration of insolvency under condition 1 and to provide that, without such election he must forfeit his indemnity against loss on that part of the account, the policy should have so provided.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Defendant refers to the provision that <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>during the term “. . . and within fifteen (15) days after acquiring knowledge of a debtor’s insolvency under any of the subdivisions (2) to (14) . . . the Insured shall file Notification of Claim with the Company ... and forthwith place the claim against such debtor with the Company for attention and collection.” Assuming that to be compulsory, it has no application to the Boyt account because plaintiff’s notice was given pursuant to subdivision (1) and not to subdivisions- (2)-to (14). The requirement of notice in subdivisions (2) to (14) and the absence of such requirement in subdivision (1) justifies the conclusion that the parties intended that action under (1) should be optional. The Notice of Insolvency which was prepared on blanks supplied by the defendant was accompanied by letter expressing the insured’s-opinion that Boyt would pay in full: Inter alia, plaintiff said, “Our only idea in notifying you is to enjoy such protection as your policy calls for under its terms in case conditions throughout the west [where Boyt was engaged] should become worse.” The receipt-of this notice was acknowledged by defendant January 14, 1931. Plaintiff’s letter of January 12th was acknowledged January 22, 1931, as follows: “With reference to your letter of the 12th inst. in regard to the above- account, the shipments of January, February and March are not covered under the conditions of your policy, as no act of insolvency has apparently occurred in reference to this debtor. We thank you to advise whether you have filed this account for collection with us.” It dóés not appear that plaintiff replied. Defendant found ño fault <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>with the notice. Thereafter, as has been stated, the Boyt company continued paying to the plaintiff. In dealing with this account the learned judge found that it was filed with the defendant for collection, and, in his final calculation, charged plaintiff with collection fees that would have been earned if collections had been made by it instead of by plaintiff. Neither party treated the account as filed for collection, and we note in its brief at No. 157 that defendant contends that the learned judge was in error in finding “that the Boyt claim was filed with [defendant] for collection.” In filing the notice of insolvency, plaintiff did not fill in the blank form required by defendant when an account was filed for collection. We regard the evidence insufficient to support the finding that the account was filed for collection.</p>

The amount of the claim was within the amount insured. The record shows payments on account and a credit for goods purchased by plaintiff from Boyt. The difference, reduced as specially provided in the policy, is the amount owing by defendant on this claim.</p>

Kev. 521, at page 525, Mr. John Hanna quotes the conditions of insolvency from “a recently issued credit insurance policy”. This form contained a condition expressly providing for the filing of claims more than 70 days past due and providing the effect of such act. At p. 525 Mr. Hanna says: “Policies vary as to provisions for collection of past-due accounts. The collection policy is in two forms, one providing for optional collection and the other for compulsory collection. The optional form permits the insured to file with the company for collection all accounts which are past due for sixty days or less and such accounts are then considered as insolvent for the purposes of the policy. Where a past-due account is not filed for collection, but the debtor becomes insolvent within the period of the policy, this account also may be filed for collection. This form of policy limits the insurer to liability for filed past-due accounts and accounts <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>becoming insolvent during the-term of the.policy. The compulsory-collection policy form provides that no loss is recoverable unless the account is placed with the insurance company for collection before the account is past due a specified number of days, whether' the debtor is insolvent or not. The latter form of policy protects the insured against all covered losses, no matter when occurring. . . .”</p>
