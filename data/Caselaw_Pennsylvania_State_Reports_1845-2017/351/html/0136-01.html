The testator further provided that if any <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>life beneficiary died without issue such share should become part of the same trusts. Such directions are found in the tenth item of the will and read: “. . . In Trust, during the lifetime of my said children respectively, so that upon the death of each of my said children the principal of their several shares shall pass undiminished to the living child or children and issue of children deceased of my said child so dying (such issue taking the share which their parent would have taken if living); but if any of my said children should die without leaving child or children living at the time of their respective deaths, or issue then living of children deceased, then I Direct that the share of such my child so dying shall fall into the residue of my estate, to be held by my said Executors or Trustees upon the same Trusts and for the same Purposes as I have directed as to the said residue.”</p>

The use of the phrase ‘then I direct’ does not change a vested interest into a contingent interest. The word ‘then’ is used in this will as a conjunction meaning ‘in that event’, not as an adverb meaning ‘at that time.’ [Frederick] had a vested interest in the Laura Straus Hibbs share subject only to being divested by the birth of issue to her.” See <em>Packer's Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/246/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="246 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1006242" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0116-01">246 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.%2070" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="92 A. 70">92 A. 70</a>; <em>Neel’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/252/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="252 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1021597" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0394-01">252 Pa. 394</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%20502" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="97 A. 502">97 A. 502</a>; <em>Wheaton Coal Co. v.
