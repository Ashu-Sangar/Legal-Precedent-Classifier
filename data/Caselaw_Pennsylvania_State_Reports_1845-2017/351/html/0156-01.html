Carmel Township, on behalf of itself and other taxpayers, to enjoin the School District, the Board of Directors, and the Tax Collector of said Township, appellants, from enforcing collection of a tax levied for the fiscal year 1942-1943 for the reason that the said tax is in excess of the millage authorized by law. The questions involved are (1) may a school board of a school district of the third class levy a tax for general purposes to provide a budget on 100% valuation, if in so doing the tax rate will be in excess of the maximum millage permitted by law, (2) may the same be done to assure funds sufficient to pay teachers’ minimum <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>salaries required by law, and (3) must such, school board include in its budget for general purposes a provision for payment of illegal salary reductions, outstanding bills, debts, and unpaid salaries.</p>

A tax of 61 mills was levied upon the County Commissioners’ valuation of $4,515,860. Several days later the Superintendent of Schools attached to the budget a statement averring that the valuation of $4,-515,860 was erroneous in that it included an excess of $1,015,860 assessed against fictitious or “dummy” corporations which have never paid taxes, and whose members and business addresses were unknown.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Of the 61 mills levied 25 were for general purposes and 36 for outstanding bills, bond issues, unpaid salaries, etc., and the district’s share of teachers’ minimum salaries. At the hearing before the chancellor, appellants sought to prove that consideration of past percentages of collectibility of taxes levied entered into determination of the total millage. The chancellor concluded that uncollectibility of taxes could not be considered, either in the levy <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>for general purposes or for teachers’ minimum salaries and increments; that appellant was restricted to 25 mills upon the assessed valuation of $4,515,860 for all purposes other than the district’s share of minimum salaries and that it could levy only 15.6 mills from the said valuation to secure the latter. The court en banc affirmed the findings and conclusions of the chancellor. This appeal followed.</p>

Power to levy in excess thereof must be found in some legislative enactment: <em>Duff v.

Tbe legislature has been definite in prescribing that this tax is to be levied upon the commissioners’ certified valuation of property and not upon a 'valuation which the school board might deem to be proper.

It cannot first determine the amount of money to be received from the maximum levy upon the assessed valuation and then, to assure receipt of said amount, formulate its own valuation on the basis of uncollectibility and impose a levy greater than the maximum permitted by law. Uncollectibility may be a factor affecting estimated receipts and expenditures; it has no application when validity of a levy in excess of that fixed by the legislature is considered. Distinction must be made between instances where the rate of levy exceeds the maximum and where it does not. <em>Cf. Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Recognizing the limitation imposed by the Act of 1911, as amended, and to make certain that sufficient revenue would be forthcoming to provide the proportionate part of the minimum salaries, the legislature empowered school boards to levy a sufficient tax without regard to the existing limitation of 25 mills. The legislature imposes upon appellant school board the duty to produce all revenue <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>necessary for this purpose. The impossibility of 100% collectibility of taxes has been recognized in <em>Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. v.

The amount which the appellant school district was required to secure as the proportionate share of the teachers’ salaries amounted to $70,292.90. Based on an estimated 73% collection, a levy of 21.4 mills would produce $253.86 in excess of the sum required. Since this is purely an estimate and since the legislature imposes upon the school district the duty to secure the actual amounts, it cannot be said that the appellant district improperly levied a 21.4 mills tax for this purpose. The court below therefore was in error in limiting the rate to 15.6 mills.</p>

This excess valuation is charged to fictitious or dummy corporations which have not paid their taxes in the past. Neither are there any known members of these corporations nor any business address. It seems that the original title holders of this so called property have made transfers of the titles with the expressed intention of either giving up the property as valueless or having the property certified on the County records for the purpose of tax evasion. Hence, the true assessed valuation should be $3,500,000.00 and not $4,515,860.00.”</p>
