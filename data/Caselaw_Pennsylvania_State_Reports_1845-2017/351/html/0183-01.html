The policy provides that certain weekly payments would be made for total disability accidentally sustained, and certain lesser payments for partial disability, if the insured be disabled by accidental injuries “to the extent that he is unable to perform one or more important daily duties pertaining to his occupation.” Plaintiff claims that he accidentally sustained personal injuries, consisting of a double incomplete inguinal hernia, which <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>totally disabled him from April 5,1942, to April 7,1942, and partially disabled Mm, within the meaning of the policy, from April 7,1942, to May 14,1943, when he was operated on for that condition. Defendant denied the condition resulted from an accident and contends it was the result of faulty development of the body of plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[223,601,1149,265]]]'>A .verdict was rendered for plaintiff for the full amount, of his. claim, $3,078.00; and after defendant’s motions for judgment, n.o.v. and a new trial had been refused, and judgment entered upon ■ the verdict, defendant appealed.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[222,876,1150,1239]]]'>Plaintiff testified that on Sunday afternoon, April 5, 1942, he was walldng on the Parkway, between 15th and 16th Streets, in Philadelphia, when he stepped on something on the sidewalk, “it was uneven — unlevel— . . . I made a jump — it was as though I stepped on a live electric wire. Naturally, I tried to get my balance. When I landed on my feet I felt as though I was going to fall, but I didn’t. I felt pain in the lower part of my abdomen, arid I réálizéd I could hardly walk. I put my hands one on each groin, and I went home, and I felt some Mnd of sickness . . . nausea.” He said that when he arrived home he noticed “Two little swellings on the groins”, and that he rested that day, and the next morning when he attempted to rehearse with the orchestra he “felt a terrible stab in the right side.” Plaintiff is a distinguished musician, the first oboeist of the Philadelphia Orchestra, of which he has been a member for many years. He testified that an oboe is a wood-wind instrument and that in order “to obtain emotion of tone it takes great physical effort.” Being unable to play his instrument, he went home, and on April 7th saw his doctor, ánd was informed of his condition and advised to wear a truss.</p>

He could only perform partially and had a substitute to take his place when he could not continue. <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>Before the accident he was required to practice two to three hours a day, and this he could not do after the accident because of pain in the groin when he exerted pressure by playing the oboe. He had previously pérformed at four or five concerts a week during the season,but he could not do this after the accident. He lost movie and radio work because of his injury. His doctor' testified that the truss did not correct his condition.and he advised an operation, which was performed. Before the accident plaintiff was in good health, and had never had pain in the inguinal region. During the period of incapacity he had no other disabling illness, except the hernia condition.</p>

Ill answer to. a long hypothetical question the doctor said: “A jar such as he has described can bring about that condition . . . It. is sufficient to bring it about.” In answer to the question.: “Can you state whether or not, in your opinion, that condition was due to that jar that he sustained in the fall which he had”, the Doctor replied: “It was sufficient. to bring about that condition.” Defendant’s position would be well taken if this were a. case in which expert testimony <em>must </em>be relied upon to show the connection between an alleged cause and a certain effect, as in the following cases cited by defendant: <em>Fink v.

In those cases expert testimony was relied upon to show that a given result came from an assigned cause, and'it was uniformly held that expert witnesses would-have to testify, not that the condition of claimant <em>might have, </em>or <em>could </em>have, or even <em>probably did </em>come from the accident, but that “it is their professional opinion the result <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>in question most probably came from the cause alleged.”</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[220,332,1148,539]]]'>This is not such a case. Indeed, the issue here is determined by a distinct separate line of cases which counsel for defendant has completely overlooked. They hold that expert testimony is not necessary where death (or injury) is so immediately and directly, or naturally and probably, the result of the accident that the connection between them does not depend solely on the testimony of professional or expert witnesses: <em>Davis v.

Plaintiff had been in excellent health, and had done the same work for thirty years before the accident. But immediately after the accident he was disabled by a perfectly obvious injury which a layman could diagnose, and he was unable to work as before. The accident and the injury were so closely connected, and so quickly apparent, that the circumstances themselves justified the submission to the jury: <em>Stracka v.

Superior Ct. 463</a>, the claimant had worked as a laborer <em>for 39 </em>years, doing heavy work.

Two doctors, testifying for defendant, stated that the hernia was congenital and not the result of the strain. In affirming an award for the claimant, the learned Superior Court said (p. 465) : “In the first place we do not regard the ease as one where the connection between the alleged cause and the injury resulting in disability is dependent on the testimony of medical or expert witnesses . . . It is a matter of common, everyday knowledge, shared by laymen as well as physicians, that hernia is frequently caused by some physical straining or overexertion . . . ‘The exciting cause of hernia is generally some over-exertion, as in lifting a heavy weight, jumping off a high wall, straining . . .
