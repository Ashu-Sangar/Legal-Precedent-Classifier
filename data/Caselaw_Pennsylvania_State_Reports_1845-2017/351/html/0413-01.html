In some cases it has been held that the remedy at law is exclusive. But the better opinion is that the beneficiary can maintain a bill in equity if he chooses. Lord Eldon once said: ‘This Court [the Court of Chancery] will not allow itself to be ousted of any part of its original jurisdiction, because a court of law happens to have fallen in love with the same or a similar jurisdiction, and has attempted (the attempt for the most part is not very successful) to administer such relief as originally was to be had here and here only.’ Similarly, in a Massachusetts case <em>[Wilkinson v. Stitt, </em><a href="/mass/175/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="175 Mass. 581" data-case-ids="19776" data-case-paths="/mass/175/0581-01">175 Mass. 581</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20N.E.%20830" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="56 N.E. 830">56 N. E. 830</a>] the court said: ‘Even when the terms of a trust have been so far complied with that the fund has been reduced to money, the amount due the <em>cestms que trust </em>ascertained and the only duty remaining upon the trustee is to pay over that amount, we have <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>never supposed that the fact that an action for the money had and received would lie at law was sufficient to oust the jurisdiction of the court in equity to compel the delivery of the money of [if] the <em>eestuis que trust </em>elected to proceed in that court.’ . . . Certainly the mere fact that the trustee is liable in an action at law does not mean that he has ceased to be a trustee and has become a debtor.”</p>
    <p id="b447-5" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[174,712,1161,1085]]]'>In Volume 1 of the Restatement of the Law of Trusts, Sec. 197, appears the following: “Except as stated in Sec. 198, the remedies of the beneficiary against the trustee are exclusively equitable.” Section 198 reads as fol-. lows: “If the trustee is under a duty to pay money immediately and unconditionally to. the beneficiary, the beneficiary can maintain an action at law against the trustee to enforce payment. If the trustee of a chattel is under a duty to transfer it immediately and unconditionally to the beneficiary and in breach of trust fails to transfer it, the beneficiary can maintain an action at law against him.” Comment (a) reads as follows: “Although the beneficiary can maintain an action at law against the trustee as stated in this Section, he has also equitable remedies against the trustee.” Section 199 declares that “the beneficiary of a trust can maintain a suit (a) to compel the trustee to perform his duties as trustee; ... (c) to compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust.” Comment (a) says: “It is immaterial that there is an adequate remedy at law (see Sec. 198).”</p>

In these situations the liability of the trustee is definite and clear and no accounting is necessary to establish it. The first situation includes cases where the trustee is under an immediate and unconditional duty to pay money to the beneficiary. The second situation includes cases in which the trustee is under a <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>duty immediately and unconditionally to transfer a chattel to the beneficiary. In other situations it is held by the weight of authority that the remedies of the beneficiary are exclusively equitable.” It is a corollary of the principle just cited that while the beneficiary of a trust may proceed to an action at <em>law </em>where the liability of the trustee is “definite and clear” (as in the instant case), the forum of equity is also open to him.</p>
