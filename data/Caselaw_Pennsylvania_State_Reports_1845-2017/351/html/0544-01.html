    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.11",575,[199,980,1153,1027]]]'>Appellant Koch and appellee Behrig were opposing candidates in the general election of November 2, 1943, for the office of school director of the Borough of Lehighton. Koch received a majority of the votes. This fact was correctly indicated by return sheets posted outside the polling place in the second ward and by return and tally return sheets within the ballot box. However, a single tally sheet was improperly marked. Its total was accurate, but the tally strokes incorrectly registered a sufficient number of votes for <em>Rehrig, </em>apparently resulting in his election. This was clearly a clerical error. The computation board discovered the discrepancy, but failed to correct it. It likewise neglected to have the ballot box opened and the vote recounted as required. As a consequence, on November 12, 1943, the board officially returned a majority of the votes for Behrig, and on November 20,1943, a certificate of election was issued to him. The county board failed to publicly announce by posting at its office the final result of the election.</p>

L. 1333, 25 PS section 3261. The box was opened in court on December 8,1943, and a, recount again gave Koch a sufficient majority to win. Ac<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>cofdingly, an order was made directing the election officials to explain the discrepancy between the return sheets and the single tally sheet. At a hearing on December 14, 1943, it was found that the tally strokes had been negligently transcribed from a work sheet to the tally sheet in question. In order to correct the board’s negligence, appellant, on December 23, 1943, presented a rule to show cause why an appeal from the action of the computation board should not be allowed <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>An appearance de bene esse was made by appellee on January 25,1944, alleging lack of jurisdiction. After hearing argument, the rule was dismissed; from that order this appeal is taken.</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[226,1003,1151,1018]]]'>The relevánt time limitations provided by the Election Code of Í937, supra, are as follows: (1) a petition for a recount must be filed within five days after the completion of the computation of the votes (Section 1404 [f], 25 PS section 3154 and section 1703 [a], 25 PS section 3263); (2) an appeal from an order or decision of the county board regarding computation must be made within two days after such order (Section 1407 [a], 25 PS section 3157); (3) a petition for a contest must be filed within twenty days after the day of election (Section 1756, 25 PS section 3456). These statutory periods hád ali expired before appellant learned of the board’s erroneous action. The learned court below decided that it had power to grant the appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>if appellant explained his delay satisfactorily. It held, however, that appellant had made no effort to acquire knowledge of the board’s action until after the expiration of the statutory period and he was therefore guilty of laches.</p>

Appellant’s position is that the negligent acts of the election board amount to fraud. He contends that the general returns posted outside the polling places showed his election; that the election hoard failed to publicly an<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>nounce the result of the election and thus prevented him from receiving notice of the discrepancy in time to correct it. Under these circumstances, appellant argues that the delay was satisfactorily explained and the appeal should have been allowed <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

One of said returns shall be immediately posted for the information of the public outside the polling place. . . .” The posted return showed that appellant was duly elected. Although appellant was entitled to attend the meeting of the computation board (Section 1403 [a], 25 PS section 3153) such attendance was not mandatory. Under the circumstances, the posted return showing his election lulled him into a false sense of security, negativing the necessity to attend or to make inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[200,1280,1151,917]]]'>There is no doubt that the board negligently computed the returns. It is required by Section 1404 (d), (1), of the Election Code, 25 PS section 3154, to compare the results from the unsealed returns with the sealed returns and with the tally sheets, and <em>if any discrepancies are discovered </em>“. . . the county board shall forthwith cause the ballot box of the district to be opened and the vote therein to be recounted in the presence of attorneys, watchers, and candidates interested. . . . .” It is further provided in (e), (1), that if a re-canvass is made “. . . the said board shall give notice in writing ... to each candidate . . . affected by the canvass, and each such candidate may be present in person or by attorney. . . .” The board completely neglected to carry out its statutory duty.

The opinion states that his failure “. . . to check upon the returns made by the Computing Board in time to take an appeal as by statute provided . . . [was not] a basis from which fraud or breakdown in the operations of the Computing Board or its officers, whereby this petitioner has been injured, is to be presumed. ...”</p>

The negligence of the computation board clearly caused appellant’s injury. The computation board had been appointed by the court, due to the disqualification of the county commissioners. The case thus falls, by analogy, within the rule reiterated in <em>Nixon v.

      <em>the </em>negligence of the justice: see collection of cases in footnote to <em>Nixon v. Nixon, </em>supra, pages 260, 261.

This Court there allowed a certification of a recount after the expiration of the statutory period for a decision upon a proceeding to correct palpable fraud or mistake, where such decision was rendered impossible by a failure to raise fully the question of fraud until after the period expired. The resulting implication is that statutory limitations are not conclusive when good cause is shown. It should be noted that <em>Greenwood Township Election Case, </em><a href="/pa/344/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="344 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1211020" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0350-01">344 Pa. 350</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20330" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="25 A.2d 330">25 A. 2d 330</a>, does not apply to the point now under consideration, because the second recount in that case was still within the statutory period.</p>

This section, however, does not provide for the correction of entries made <em>erroneously, </em>which are discovered, as here, after the issuance of the certificate of election. Therefore, under Section 1701, appellant was allowed four months after the election in which to petition for an opening of the ballot box to discover whether errors were committed in the computation of the votes, but only allowed a maximum of twenty days to institute a contest, and that only if <em>fraud </em>were discovered.
