The defendant was indicted on March 3,1925, for the murder of Roosevelt Merchison on September 8, 1924. Both the defendant and Merchison were colored<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> men. The defendant was not apprehended until 18 years after the homicide, when he was arrested in Los Angeles and brought back to Pittsburgh. He was tried before Judge J. Frank Graff, special presiding, and a jury. The verdict of the jury was guilty of murder in the first degree, with the penalty of life imprisonment. On October 26, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>1942, a motion for a new trial was filed reserving, inter alia, “the right to file additional reasons for a new trial as soon as the testimony and charge have been properly transcribed and examined.” The testimony was filed on November 30,1942, but no additional reasons were filed for a new trial. The motion for a new trial was argued on December 18, 1942, and refused six days later, and on January 8,1943, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the period of his natural life. No appeal was taken.</p>

L. Doering, to the effect that the murdered man was shot by a white man; Dr. Doering was not called as a witness in the trial. Counsel filed a petition for reargument. A‘rule to show cause was granted. The District Attorney raised the question of the authority of the court to alter its sentence after the term had expired, and on June 23,1943, Judge Graff sustained this contention. The. petition for writ of coram nobis was then presented to the court and after some delay this petition was ordered to be filed. On November 24, 1943, a rule thereon was granted.

This writ was not discussed in Blackstone, but in footnote 28 to “star” page 411 in the Third Volume of Lewis’ Edition of Blackstone, appears the following: “In this chap<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>ter Sir W. Blackstone has considered only the modes by which a judgment may be reversed by writ of error brought in a court of appeal, and has stated that this can only be done for error in law. There is, however, a proceeding to reverse a judgment by writ of error in the same court, where the error complained of is <em>in fact </em>and not in law, and where of course no fault is imputed to the court in pronouncing its judgment. This writ is called the writ coram nobis [Before us] or coram vobis, [Before you,] according as the proceedings are in the King’s Bench or Common Pleas, because the record is stated to remain before us (the king) if in the former, and before you (the judges) if in the latter, and is not removed to another court. In this proceeding it is of course necessary to suggest a new fact upon the record, from which the error in the first judgment will appear: thus, supposing the defendant, being an infant, has appeared by attorney instead of guardian, it will be necessary to suggest the fact of his infancy of which the court was not before informed. There is therefore no inconsistency in bringing this writ of error before the same judges who pronounced the judgment in the first instance; because they are required to pronounce upon a new state of facts, without impeachment of the former judgment on the facts as they then stood. — Coleridge.”</p>

The Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act of MAy 4, 1939, P.

The color (or identity) of the man who shot this patient had no medical or surgical relationship whatsoever to the patient’s physical condition at the time. It was really none of the physician’s <em>professional </em>“business” who shot the <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>patient.

The record as to the color of the man who shot the patient was merely a bit of gratuitous reporting on the part of the physician. It is not “made in the regular course of the physician’s business.” “The [Evidence] Act [of May 4, 1939] did not . . . make all business and professional records competent evidence regardless of by whom, in what manner, and for what purpose they were compiled, or offered”: <em>Freedman v.

On the other hand, if the same patient told the physician that he had just seen A shoot B and the physician noted <em>that </em>fact on the hospital record and later A was being tried for shooting B, the record in the hospital would not be admissible to prove that A had shot B.

He left there then on Saturday morning and he didn’t come back Saturday night. He came back Sunday night but didn’t come back any more until Monday when he came and asked for Mr. Merchison around four o’clock in the afternoon.” Merchison was not then at home and the defendant asked “what time he would be home.” When told “five o’clock” the defendant said “I can wait for him.” Merchison came in at five o’clock and the defendant asked him to “show him the way to Rankin.” Merchison said “he would.” He then “cleaned himself up” and when the witness asked bim “if he would have supper” he replied “No, it won’t take <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>me long.

At the hospital it was found by the physican that Merchison had two gunshot wounds in the head, which caused his death on November 5,1924. The bullet wounds had caused inflammation of the brain, one bullet having entered the brain. He also had a wound in his chest.

He stopped on Second Street, [Bankin], and he got out and he went in a house, he said, to get a drink; then he asked me to have one and I said no, I didn’t care for any. He got out and left me in the car. He went in and had a drink and came back. We went from there on to Homestead and when we got in Homestead, he stopped there. I said to myself, this man is no stranger” (apparently meaning in this locality). A second stop was made in Homestead. They then started back to Pittsburgh. Midway of the bridge, the man said “Gee, there’s something wrong with the car. Let’s get out and see what it is.” Merchison then said to him “We can’t stop here because we’ll tie.up the traffic, we’ll wait until we get to the other side of the bridge.” Then we drove to the other side of the bridge and drove off to the side. The other man <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>then said “You raise the hood and see what’s wrong.” Merchison did so. “The man then fired and the bullet hit me in the right shoulder.” Merchison then ran over the hill, saying to himself “I’ll hide.” “The man came down on me again.” “I was low down in the gutter. When he attempted to shoot me again I attempted to reach up and grab the gun and I did grab the gun and when I grabbed the gun is when the bullet shot me here” (indicating the forehead). “I remember no more. When I came to, I said ‘If I don’t get up and get out from here, I’ll die and no one will know where I am.’ I struggled to the road and with that I saw a gentleman [Earl Wayne] coming along in a car on his way to work and I flagged him. He wanted to carry me to the Homestead Hospital and I told him ‘No, don’t take me there. Take me home, and if I die before I get home, tell them the man that says his name is Arthur Williams shot me.’ ” Mrs. Hawkins saw Merchison every day until he died. She said she had been keeping company with him “going into two years.” She asked Merchison who was Arthur Williams and he said “the fellow that asked me to show him the way to Homestead, and came to the house and he left home with me, and he went these places with him and he shot him on their return and he said his name was Arthur Williams.”</p>

You could see with each step he took he was on the verge of falling.” The witness got out of his machine and asked the colored man “Are you hurt?” The latter answered “Yes.” The witness then offered to take him to the hospital. “There was a machine pulled up on the other side of the street and he said ‘Don’t pass that machine, the man in that machine shot me.’ ” That machine was on the other side of the stréet headed toward Pittsburgh.

He testified that he was in New York City working at Havey’s Garage from September to December, 1924. Then he went to South Dakota and to Washington state and to other Western states, and that he worked for a time at the Bellingham Golf and Country Club in the State of Washington.

He said that he never knew Roosevelt Merchison, that he never owned a revolver in his life, and that he did not go with Roosevelt Merchison into the neighborhood of what is called Brown Hill Road, on September 8, 1924. He denied that he had ever had a car fixed at the auto repair shop of William H. Rowe, who had identified him at the trial, as above stated. He said he never saw the witness, Meda Harley, in his life. He claimed that he did not know until his arrest in August, 1942, that there was an indictment in Allegheny County charging him with the murder of Roosevelt Merchison. On cross-examination he stated that he had been arrested one time in Youngstown, Ohio, on “suspicion,” that he had served four months for that. He was asked “How many times have you been picked up?” He answered “three.” Once he had been arrested in Portland, Oregon. He admitted in cross-examination that he had been in Rankin, Pennsylvania, which he said was 14 or 15 miles from Pittsburgh, and that he had remained in Rankin two years, until 1921. He first stated that during those two years he had never come to Pittsburgh. An instant later he said “Oh yes, I came to Pittsburgh” during those two years. When he was asked “Did you hear Mrs. Meda Harley testify yesterday that you were sent to her residence by Mr. Gibson?” he answered “yes.” He was then asked “Was that true?” He answered “no sir.” He also said he never had any dealings or business of any kind in Pittsburgh, that he never went shopping in Pittsburgh and had no friends in Pittsburgh. He admitted that he had friends in Rankin, where he had worked in the Rankin Wire &amp; Steel Mill, that he quit working in that mill on the 1st of March, 1921, and then went to Detroit where he remained for three weeks, then he came to Youngstown, Ohio, where he was arrested and served four months in jail.</p>

Mrs. Harley testified that when the defendant came to the lodging house for a room (ostensibly as a “delegate to the Elks Convention” ) he said “Mr. Gibson sent him” there.

That she remembered the conversation with the fatally wounded victim 18 years after it took place is understandable. She had “kept company” with Merchison, for two years and “supposed she was in love with him.” It is a matter of common knowledge that when something tragic happens to one who is closely associated with a person, that person will long remember not only the tragedy but also all the circumstances surrounding it, for an emotional experience of great intensity casts a strong light on all its surroundings, and as a consequence they as well as the central event are deeply impressed on the memory. Furthermore, the witness Hawkins told substantially the same story at the Coroner’s inquest shortly after Merchison died. The attempt of counsel to discredit her statement as to what Merchison told her when he believed himself dying, by introducing the notes of the testimony taken at the Coroner’s inquest, was not successful.</p>

If Dr. Doering had been told by Merchison that “a white man” had shot him, he would naturally have so reported to the police, and there would have been at least some police search for <em>that </em>man. The record discloses no search for such a man. Immediately after Merchison was discovered in a fatally wounded condition and made a statement about the assault all police activities centered on a search for <em>this defendant, </em>for it was to <em>him </em>and to no one else that all the evidence pointed to as the assassin. Dr. George B. Moreland, who first treated Merchison when he was brought to the hospital, and Dr. Charles H. Ley, who examined Merchison and who saw him several times and who operated on his skull, both testified at the trial, but neither said anything about Merchison having stated that “a white man” had shot him.</p>

The mere fact that the statement of the victim was in response to a question did not make it ««.voluntary and did not destroy that spontaneity which is the characteristic of a res gestee declaration. When anyone suddenly meets a person who has just been severely injured, he naturally asks: “What happened to you?” or “Who shot you?” and when the latter immediately replies, his statement is no more open to the charge of being a fabrication than the same statement would be if there had been no question asked. It would be a totally unwarranted handicap to the administration of justice if res gestae declarations, which are usually of great probative value, were excluded because a simple, natural question was put to the fatally injured victim a few minutes after the occurrence of the tragic event. Victims of unexpected assaults are not likely while suffering the agonies of a murderous assault just made upon them to fabricate a lie as to the identity of their assailant. The real test of the admissibility of a declaration as res gestee is whether the circumstances under which it was made were such as seem to preclude premeditation and design on the part of the declarant. The declaration made in the <em>instant </em>case by a grievously assaulted man, at the place of the assault and apparently only a few moments after it was made and while his assailant was apparently still nearby, fully met the test of admissibility. The declaration obviously emanated directly from the perceptions of the victim while his mind was still under the domination of the shock of the sudden assault. At that tragic moment he would not be likely to fabricate a falsehood in respect to what he had just experienced, for at such a time considerations of calculated policy are not in the ascendant.</p>
