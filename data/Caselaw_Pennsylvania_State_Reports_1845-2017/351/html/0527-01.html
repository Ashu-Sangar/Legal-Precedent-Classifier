Plaintiffs, however, raise <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>questions regarding the interpretation of this section of the statute and as to its constitutionality. They contend that the condition that “there is at the time or will, in the opinion of the council ... , be a default in the payment of principal thereon within one year” should not be construed so as to allow Council to entertain or. express such an opinion if the revenues derived from taxation will be sufficient to liquidate the bonds maturing during the year and if a default in the payment of the principal will therefore arise only if all such revenues are devoted to the general needs of the city government instead of the amount required to meet the maturities being first placed in the sinking fund as provided by law.</p>

It is inconceivable that the City of Pittsburgh or any other municipality will ever become reduced to such a desperate condition as to be unable to raise by taxation merely the amount needed to meet its sinking fund requirements, and, even if such a situation should materialize, it is obvious that no purchaser could then be found who would purchase refunding bonds issued under such conditions. Plaintiffs suggest that the statute would come into use in cases where “the bank in which the sinking funds were deposited closed, or where taxpayers were unable to pay their taxes because of a depression or other emergency, or where moneys in the sinking fund had been stolen”. Surely the authority given by the Municipal Borrowing Law to refund maturing bonds was not intended to be limited to such extreme situations as those thus depicted. What was evidently intended was that the “default” which would give rise to the right to refund maturing bonds would occur whenever, in the opinion of Council, the taxes that could reasonably be levied and collected would be insufficient to meet the general operating expenses of the <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>municipality in addition to the sinking fund requirements. A city which, even if it liquidated its funded indebtedness, could not obtain sufficient revenues to operate its essential governmental activities, would automatically cease to exist.</p>
    <p id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[215,544,1150,974]]]'>It need scarcely be stated that this court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy adopted in this instance by the Council of the City of Pittsburgh. Unduly burdensome taxation should, as far as possible, be avoided, but whether the millage rate in Pittsburgh has reached a practical maximum, whether the government of the city can be more economically administered, whether the need for increases in the salaries and wages of its employees and for the repair and rehabilitation of its plant and equipment is as urgent as represented, whether better methods of financing are reasonably available, are all questions for legislative, not judicial, consideration. If, in the judgment of the Council, the existing situation can be better met by issuing refunding bonds than by levying taxes sufficient, when added to the moneys in the sinking fund, to liquidate the maturing bonds, there is no right in a court to interfere with that judgment unless it involves a violation of law.</p>

Several statutes have been passed implementing these constitutional mandates, beginning with the Act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, sections 2 and 4, and extending down to the Municipal Borrowing Law of 1941, section 207 and Article IV. The Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, for the government of cities of the second class, Article XIX, section 3, VII, and the amendatory <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Act of June 27, 1913, P. L. 644, section 3, contain such provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> Moreover, the various ordinances under which the maturing bonds were issued in the present case observed these requirements by providing prospectively for the levy and assessment annually of a tax sufficient' to pay the interest on the bonds and for a sinking fund for the payment of the principal as it became due, and the bonds themselves contained similar language. It is also true that the decisions of this court have time and again emphasized the inviolability of sinking funds for the redemption of municipal obligations and the need for scrupulous ■ performance of the duty to deposit the required annual amounts into such funds from the tax revenues of the municipality. “That these constitutional provisions [referring, inter alia, to Art. IX, sec. 10] are mandatory and not merely directory, and are to be viewed in the light of limitations upon the powers to be exercised by municipalities, seems to us clear; They are safeguards in the interest of the taxpayer that must be observed”: <em>Borough of Rainsburg v.

But here no question , is involved as to the integrity of any of the sinking funds of the City of Pittsburgh, nor has there been any diversion of moneys from • those funds or from any tax levies required to liquidate the city’s funded indebtedness. The moneys in the sinking funds applicable to the payment of the maturing bonds are to be used for that purpose. There has been no breach, of the contracts entered into with the bondholders, for obviously it makes no difference to them from what source the money is derived which is to be used for the payment of their bonds.</p>
    <p id="b565-3" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[243,983,1153,1139]]]'>There is nothing in the Constitution or .statutes of Pennsylvania which requires that the funded indebtedness of a municipality shall be paid <em>only </em>out of moneys derived from taxation' and accumulated in the sinking funds. On the contrary, beginning with the Act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, see. 7, passed contemporaneously with the adoption of the Constitution, there have been numerous statutory enactments providing for the refunding of municipal indebtedness. Such an act, for example, was that of April 14, 1881, P. L. 10, which was extended to cities of the first and second classes by the amendatory Act of March 1, 1899, P. L. 6; other examples are the Acts of January 5, 1934, P. L.- 218, and May 9, 1935, P: L. 155. Thus we find a series of statutes running side by side with those providing for the maintenance and integrity of the sinking funds, and between these two chains of enactments there is no conflict or inconsistency ; they establish two different methods of liquidating the maturing bonds of municipalities, the one method, that of refunding, to be used only under the circumstances and conditions specifically prescribed.'</p>

    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[216,389,1149,528]]]'>In 1940 the City Council of Pittsburgh refunded $2,398,000 of “electoral” bonds; in 1944 it refunded $1,000,000 of “electoral” bonds; the ordinances challenged in this case provide for the refunding of an additional $600,000 of “electoral” bonds. As a result of these refunding operations the City Council of Pittsburgh has borrowed approximately $4,000,000 for current expenses without increasing its “councilmanic” debt and without decreasing its “electoral” indebtedness.</p>

    <p id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.8",567,[216,1156,1150,254]]]'>The Constitution sets two limits on the debt of municipalities. Article IX, Section 8, limits the debt which can be incurred to <em>7% </em>of the assessed valuation of the taxable property. Of this 7% only <em>2% </em>can be borrowed without the consent of the electors.</p>
    <p id="b567-8" data-blocks='[["BL_567.9",567,[216,1430,1151,471]]]'>Article IX, Section 10, and Article XV, Section 3, are concerned with liquidation of the debt. They provide that before or at the time of incurring an indebtedness a municipality must provide “for the collection of an <em>annual tax </em>sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years”. (Italics added.) Every municipality is required to “create a sinking fund, which shall be <em>inviolably </em>pledged for the payment of the debt”.</p>

Section 503 of the Act, which is concerned with refunding, says that “All assets in the sinking fund applicable to the payment of the principal of the bonds to be refunded shall first be so applied.” But, in this instance the City did not deposit any taxes in the sinking funds and there <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>were therefore no assets in the sinking funds to apply to the payment of the bonds, :</p>

    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[196,603,1149,261]]]'>The result of the decision in this case is that taxes need not be levied each year to pay off the debt, and that the debt need not be liquidated in thirty years; that by the device of refunding, the City can keep the outstanding indebtedness indefinitely unliquidated.</p>
    <p id="b568-6" data-blocks='[["BL_568.6",568,[196,875,1149,419]]]'>This is a clear violation of the Constitution. It also offends the laws of sound financing. The kind of refunding now legalized in Pennsylvania by the decision in this case will permit municipalities to obtain money for current operations which should be used to liquidate their bonded indebtedness. Municipalities in Pennsylvania are no longer compelled to reduce and pay their funded debt.</p>

    <p id="b569-3" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[199,656,1148,316]]]'>All this has now been completely ignored and overruled. Instead a municipality is now permitted to divert annual taxes from the sinking fund and use them for other purposes. In other words the method prescribed by the Constitution for the payment and reduction of the funded indebtedness is entirely set aside.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[195,985,1151,536]]]'>The framers of the Constitution were concerned not only with the payment of the funded debt but also with an annual reduction of the debt. The contention of the City is that the money received from refunding goes into the sinking fund for payment of the bonds, and that this satisfies the Constitutional requirement. This argument loses sight of the fact that the Constitution requires annual taxes to be used for payment of-the debt and requires the debt to be reduced annually and completely liquidated in thirty years. - ;</p>

These, then, are among terms of the contract which the City agreed to <em>perform; </em>they are part of the obligation.” -.</p>
    <p id="b569-6" data-blocks='[["BL_569.7",569,[188,2079,1149,375]]]'>In this case sixty-two issues of bonds are being refunded by the City of Pittsburgh.

    <p id="b570-3" data-blocks='[["BL_570.3",570,[211,273,1149,537]]]'>
      <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>The vice of such refunding is demonstrated in the record before us, which shows the refunding of $50,-000 of bonds of the City of Pittsburgh which were issued in 1944 to refund bonds which became due that year. The kind of refunding approved by the decision in this case will surely result in a procession of refunding by many municipalities. The device is nothing better than a rotation of refunding bonds, which can be carried to the point where all bonds of a municipality are refunded and none are ever paid.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[210,822,1151,208]]]'>By the same device a municipality which has reached its limit in borrowing power may continue indefinitely obtaining money for current expenses by using taxes which should go to liquidation of its bonds.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[210,1041,1153,1354]]]'>I do not believe that the Municipal Borrowing Act of 1941 was intended to permit unlimited refunding. Article 5 of the Act contains provisions for funding and refunding bonds. Section 503 provides that where, in the opinion of the council, there is or will be a default in the payment of principal of funded bonds, the municipality for the purpose of paying off such bonds may issue and sell refunding bonds. The default contemplated is a default “in the payment of the bonds”. This means that although a tax has been levied and appropriated to the sinking fund it is not sufficient to pay off the bonds when they mature. This would occur only in an emergency, as for instance, where there has been a great failure of taxpayers to pay their taxes, or where a bank in which the sinking funds were deposited failed, or some such unexpected happening over which the municipality had no control. Such an emergency existed in <em>Com. ex rel. v. </em>Cannon, <a href="/pa/308/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="308 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1140313" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0321-01">308 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20277" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="162 A. 277">162 A. 277</a>. There, because of a great economic depression the County of Cambria was unable to pay its <em>bonded </em>debt and was permitted to refund. President Judge Mc-Cann, in his opinion, said: “The situation confronting the County Commissioners is an urgent need to relieve an almost intolerable financial burden resting upon the County.</p>
    <p id="b571-2" data-blocks='[["BL_571.3",571,[220,267,1150,482]]]'>
      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>“This situation is brought about, in part by the collapse of the coal trade, which has reduced this County from one of the richest in the State to a condition of financial stringency, and in part by the world wide depression, the latter having resulted in economic distress in Cambria County of such severe nature and far reaching extent as to tax seriously the ability of the County to look after its unemployed by the extending of relief in the most insignificant amounts.</p>
    <p id="b571-3" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[220,762,1149,199]]]'>“The County is scarcely able to carry on its most needed functions. Our Courts have been suspended for a period of several months as a necessary economy move, and the outlook for the immediate future is indeed dark.”</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[217,982,1153,699]]]'>I cannot believe that the legislature in speaking of a default meant that council could divert taxes inviolably pledged for the payment of bonds to current expenses and describe the result as a default in the payment of bonds. The default contemplated by the statute is certainly one over which council has no control. The default announced by the City of Pittsburgh in Ordinances 312 and 313 is one which council created. The Municipal Borrowing Act, Section 503, does not permit the municipalities of the Commonwealth to create a default in every issue of bonds as they mature by diverting the taxes pledged for the payment of the bonds to the payment of current expenses or other obligations.</p>
    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.6",571,[215,1694,1150,481]]]'>It may well be that the City of Pittsburgh needs additional revenue for current expenses. If so, there are a number of methods known to the law by which such need can be supplied. To accomplish the result it is not necessary to nullify the Constitution and place municipal finances on an unsound basis. So far as Pittsburgh is particularly concerned it is well within its debt limitation, and in the usual legal way, by increasing its indebtedness, can obtain the money it needs.</p>
