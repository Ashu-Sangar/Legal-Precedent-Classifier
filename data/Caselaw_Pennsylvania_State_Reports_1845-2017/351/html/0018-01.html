The five plaintiffs and two defendants are brothers and sisters, children of Elizabeth ITamara, a widow, who died intestate on October 6, 1939. The agreement was executed by six of the seven children. Michael, a son, was not present when the agreement was signed, but acquiesced in it and is a party plaintiff. Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment n. o. v. was refused and judgment entered on the verdict, two of the five judges dissenting, in an opinion written by President Judge Valentine. This appeal followed.</p>

The issue is whether a $5,300 bank account in the First National Bank of Nanticoke in the names of the mother and two of the daughters, Susanna and Helen (the defendants), was included under the terms of the agreement.</p>

A few hours before the execution of the agreement, and while en route to the lawyer’s office to execute the same, the defendants, without plaintiffs’ knowledge, went to the bank, withdrew the deposit, and divided it between them. This was admitted by the defendants at the trial, although it was unqualifiedly denied by them in their affidavit of defense. When the plaintiffs discovered that defendants had withdrawn and divided the fund, this action in assumpsit was brought against them.</p>

It may be noted, in passing, that this testimony was in flat contradiction of the sworn statement of the two defendants in their affidavit of defense that the money “was the sole and separate property of Susanna Hamara Wolliver”.

The court below failed to give effect to the written words immediately preceding the printed ones: viz: that withdrawals by the <em>daughters </em>were restricted <em>until after the death of the mother. </em>Thus, while the <em>printed </em>words would have created a present interest in the daughters, the <em>written </em>words were repugnant to such a construction. Obviously it was not the purpose of the written insertion <em>“Pay to Dtrs only after death of Mother” </em>to emphasize the right of survivorship clearly stated in the printed terms. Such a construction of these words would make them meaningless surplusage. It is well settled that in construing written instruments effect must be given to <em>all </em>of the parts, if this is possible. Words cannot be deleted or construed away merely because they interfere with a reader’s desired interpretation. Here, the printed words purport to give all of the persons named on the deposit card a present joint ownership in the account. The written words, however, completely negative such an intention. They expressly deny to the daughters the right to receive payment of the fund during the lifetime of the mother. The plain meaning of the insertion is that the mother, <em>and the mother alone, </em>could make withdrawals during her life<a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>time. If there were any ambiguity in the written words, such ambiguity would be resolved by the testimony of the bank official, who made the insertion of the written words at the decedent’s request. He testified that only one withdrawal was made upon the account prior to the death of the mother, and that this was made by the mother. He was asked: “Q. To make it simple so the jury Avill understand; after this account Avas opened, and according to the agreement on your card, Susanna and Helen could both have withdrawn money, could they not? A. After the death of the mother, yes sir. Q. And during the life of the mother? A. <em>Not with that notation on there. </em>Q. Under what? Under what, Mr. Bejza? A. Pay to daughters only after death of mother. Q. Well that is above the agreement, isn’t it? A. <em>That is part of the agreement.” </em>On re-direct examination he was asked, “Q. However, during the lifetime of Mrs. Elizabeth Hamara your bank paid no money to anybody but her? A. <em>Nobody but Mrs. Mamara.” </em>In the face of this evidence showing the construction placed upon the contract of deposit by the parties prior to the death of the mother, and in consideration of the plain meaning of the written words themselves, it cannot be pretended that the insertion made no change in the printed terms of the card.</p>

This principle was recognized by this Court in <em>Mardis v. Steen, </em>supra, which is cited by the majority in the court below. Justice Frazer (later Chief Justice) in the opinion in that case cites with approval and discusses <em>Grady v.

As Justice Frazer points out (page 17) such direction rendered the paper <em>“testamentary in character, and consequently not effective to vest a present interest. </em>. . .” Perhaps the leading case on this principle is <em>Turner v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/51/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="51 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="999790" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0126-01">51 Pa. 126</a>.

She could have withdrawn the <em>entire amount, </em>thereby effectively revoking the gift to her survivors. This was the effect of the written insertion on the printed card. The fact that it deprived the daughters of any vested interest in the fund until her death, although they were named on the card as joint owners, was not violative of any law. The Banking Code of May 15,1933, P. L. 624, Section 903, provides: “A. Whenever a deposit shall be made in an institution in the names of two or more persons, the institution shall not pay out such deposit, any part thereof, or interest thereon, except upon the proper check, order or receipt, as the case may be, of both or all of such persons, <em>unless at the time of making the deposit a different arrangement shall have been specifically provided for. . . </em>.” Here the written provision on the card specifically provided for the exclusion of the daughters from participation in the fund until the death of the mother, leaving the fund her property during her lifetime, subject to her disposal, with the direction that it be paid to her daughters upon her death. The deposit agreement was therefore testamentary in character, and the balance remaining in the account was part of the mother’s gross estate. The evidence of the daughters was entirely insufficient to establish that any part of the fund was their individual property. The money was deposited in one sum by the mother, and while the daughters alleged that it represented in part their individual earnings, which she had “saved” for them, they did not indicate how much of the sum represented such earnings, or whose property they were at the time of the deposit. The daughter Helen testified that she “gave” her earnings all to her mother. The daughter Susanna testified that the fund represented <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>the earnings of <em>her mother </em>and sister, as well as her own, which her mother had saved.'

In that case the owner of a savings account presented a letter to the bank of deposit directing that the account “be made a joint account with my son . . . <em>the money to be drawn only in case of my death.” </em>It was held that a vested interest in the fund had been presently created for the son although his enjoyment was deferred, and that the instrument was not testamentary. There, however, no money was to be drawn by either the son <em>or the donor </em>during the latter’s lifetime. The fund could not be diminished or completely consumed by the donor, assuming, as the Superior Court apparently did, that the gift was <em>irrevocable. </em>In the present case, however, the mother could, and <em>did, </em>draw upon the fund during her lifetime, retaining thereby the power to revoke the gift to the daughters, who were entitled to payment only after her death.</p>

How different the facts of the instant case, where not anything was appointed to be done after the mother’s death.

Since none of the three could have drawn the fund without the consent of the others,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> not anything was gained by anyone by placing the injunction— payable only after death of mother — on the card.
