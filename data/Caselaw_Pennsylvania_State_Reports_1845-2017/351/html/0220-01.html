    <p id="b252-8" data-blocks='[["BL_252.10",252,[222,1077,1152,854]]]'>This is an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, in a Workmen’s Compensation case. The question is: Was the deceased husband of claimant at the time he met with a fatal accident “an independent contractor” or “an employee?” The Eeferee found that the deceased was the former, the Compensation Board found that he was the latter, the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County affirmed the Board, and the Superior Court reversed the Court of Common Pleas. The facts in this case are few and no one of them is conclusive. The decision must depend on the facts <em>taken in their entirety. </em>Are they an indicia of a <em>master </em>and <em>servant </em>relationship or of Thomas’ status as an <em>independent contractor? </em>The answer to that question decides this case. The deciders must reach a decision by way of inferences.</p>
    <p id="b252-9" data-blocks='[["BL_252.11",252,[223,1950,1147,365]]]'>We agree with the Superior Court in its statement that “There is no disagreement or dispute in the testimony as to the material basic facts in the case. Hence, the question ... is not really one of fact, but of law . . . and is therefore subject to review and revision by the court, whose duty it is to declare the legal effect of the facts in evidence.”</p>

      <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>In deciding this question there is both a rule of procedure and a rule of policy which must be applied. The former is that the burden of proving that the deceased James Thomas was an employee was on the claimant: <em>Sechrist v. Kurtz Bros., </em><a href="/pa-super/147/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="147 Pa. Super. 214" data-case-ids="1039056" data-case-paths="/pa-super/147/0214-01">147 Pa.

The rule of policy is: “. <em>. </em>. neither the compensation authorities nor the courts should be solicitous to put claimants in that position [of an independent contractor] when a reasonable view of the evidence warrants a finding that the injured person was an employee”: Gai<em>ley v. State Workmen’s Insurance Fund, </em><a href="/pa/286/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="286 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1096460" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0311-01">286 Pa. 311</a>, 314. To the same effect is <em>Myers v. Maurer &amp; Myers, </em><a href="/pa-super/144/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="144 Pa. Super. 385" data-case-ids="1032753" data-case-paths="/pa-super/144/0385-01">144 Pa. Superior Ct. 385</a>. These two rules can be reconciled only by saying that while the burden of proof <em>is </em>on the claimant, the preponderance in favor of the claim need only be a slight one, and in drawing inferences from the facts the inferences in favor of the claim need make only a slightly stronger appeal to reason than possible inferences in opposition to it.</p>

That the work of Mr. Thomas for Mr. Bache was not exclusive nor was it consecutive. By exclusive is specifically meant that Mr. Thomas worked for others and that he did not work for Mr. Bache solely.

      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>The Superior Court criticized the Board’s 9th finding of fact, chiefly for the statement contained therein that'“the time for the men being turned in to the defendant by the decedent,” and for the statement that the four men were hired by Thomas. The Superior Court said: As to the two carpenters, Davis and Cease, “Bache had asked Thomas to hire Davis. He knew of Thómás’- hiring of Cease.” “Mr. Bache had not hired” the two laborers “Lewis and a boy named Clapps. . . He did' not know who [they] were previous to their coming to work.” The Superior Court also criticized the Board’s 14th finding that “defendant was engaged in the real estate business operating three apartment houses containing 13 apartments” in all, and the Board’s setting aside the Referee’s finding of fact that “the work done by the decedent and four men who worked with him was directed entirely by the decedent [Thomas], who also supplied the equipment with which the work was done.”</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[238,1314,1150,863]]]'>The record facts in respect to the ninth finding are as follows: Bache testified that “I told him [Thomas] I wanted Mr. Davis to work on the job.” Thomas answered : “All right.” “He [Thomas] said he would get Cease [also, to work on the job], was that all right? And I said yes.” In other words, Bache not only “knew” of Cease’s employment, but he <em>expressly consented </em>to it. As to the laborer, Clapps,. Bache in his testimony referred to him as “My boy; a boy [who] worked in the store, Clapps.” It is a reasonable inference that Bache directed the employment of Clapps on this job; he must at least have consented to his employment since Clapps was a helper in his store. As the record does not show how Clapps was paid, the inference is that his pay as a boy working in Bache’s store continued. The carpenter, Hayden Davis, testified as follows:</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[237,2187,1144,153]],["BL_257.1",257,[190,281,1148,99]]]'>“I met Mr. Bache before this job was started. He said he was going to put a new roof on, and he said when he was ready to put it on he would have Mr. Thomas <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>notify me. So when the job started Mr. Thomas called me up the day before, so I went to work.”</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[187,391,1150,537]]]'>Davis said: “Thomas acted as foreman there,” and that he, Davis, “looked to Mr. Bache for his money” and he “supposed” Bache “could have discharged” him. The fact that Thomas did not actually “turn in” to Bache the “time” of the two carpenters and the two laborers on the job, is unimportant. A “turning in of time” by a foreman to the paying employer is for the latter’s protection. In the instant case the employees “turned in” their own time, for as the Superior Court says, “Bache knew them personally and relied on their word.”</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[185,940,1150,591]]]'>As to Bache’s business, in addition to keeping a store, it is clearly set forth in the stipulation. He owned, in addition to his store, eleven farms, with buildings and “three apartment buildings, a double frame dwelling, and two single dwellings. That these tenanted and other properties required in their maintenance considerable carpenter work from time to time, which Thomas performed for Bache “during several years,” clearly appears. As to Thomas’ directing the work of the four other men on their job, that is entirely consistent with his status as foreman-employee, as we later point out.</p>
    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[185,1542,1151,866]],["BL_258.1",258,[255,285,1147,308]]]'>The record discloses that a very loose arrangement was entered into by Bache and Thomas for this shingling job. There was no formal contract, either oral or written, and no plans or specifications. Bache testified: “I told him [Thomas] I wanted to put a roof on and that I would buy the shingles and the nails.” Thomas replied: “All right.” Bache said: “I never asked him [Thomas] how much he would charge me for the job.” Apparently it was understood that Thomas and the carpenters were each to receive $7 a day, which was the same pay as Thomas had customarily received on the other carpenter jobs performed by him for Bache from time to time for several years. Hayden Davis testified that Thomas told him “the rate of wages on that job would be f&gt;7 [a day].” Cease, one of the carpenters, testified that he was paid $7 a day by Bache, that Thomas <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>told Mm (Cease) that “Carter Bache’s rate of wages was $7 [a day] and said if we put in any more than that we wouldn’t have any more work.” He said: “Jim Thomas was boss, he was foreman.” Both Davis and Cease testified that they gave none of their pay to Thomas.</p>
    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[257,610,1150,913]]]'>Bache replied “yes” to the question: “You could have dismissed him [Thomas] and gotten somebody else to do the job, could you not?” In so answering, the clear implication is that Bache believed that he could have dismissed Thomas at any time and without being liable for breach of contract, as would have been the case had Thomas been an independent contractor. 14 Ruling Case Law, Sec. 8, p. 71, states: “The power of an employer to terminate the employment at any time is incompatible with the full control of the work which is usually enjoyed by an independent contractor, and hence is considered as a strong circumstance tending to show the subserviency of the employee. Indeed, it has been said that no single fact is more conclusive, perhaps, than the unrestricted right of the employer to end the particular service whenever he chooses, without regard to the final result of the work itself.”</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[258,1543,1149,426]]]'>Thomas furnished the tools needed for the work. Bache said he “imagined” that the only tools used on this job were “the saw and hammer and axe which every carpenter has or should have.” Bache also testified that it was “five or six years ago” when he first had Thomas do “general work” (apparently <em>carpenter </em>work) in his (Baehe’s) “business places” and that his and Thomas’ relationship was “very satisfactory.”</p>
    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[255,1978,1148,430]],["BL_259.1",259,[203,262,1149,540]]]'>As to the frequency of Thomas’ employment by Bache, Mrs. Thomas testified: “Whenever he [Bache] called him [Thomas], he went to work for him.” As Mrs. Thomas thus described the nature of the work her husband had done for Bache, from time to time: One night garage doors “went wrong” and her husband went down at once to “fix them.” Another night he “worked all night to put a floor in; because the store was busy <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>he did that on a few nights.” Thomas also remodeled for Bache “one of the apartments,” “tore out partitions,” “remodeled a barn,” “worked on another apartment and built a garage.” Thomas might be described as Bache’s “handy man” at any kind of carpentry work that Bache needed; Bache answered “Yes sir?’ to the following question: “Over a period of years that Mr. Thomas had. done this work for you you did have a general understanding, did you not, that he would do your general carpentry, work for you?”</p>

The looseness of Bache’s engagement of Thomas for this job is more nearly consistent with the relationship of master and servant than that of owner and independent contractor.

The two carpenters who worked with Thomas described him as their foreman. A foreman is exactly what the ;name implies. He leads, i.e., directs, other employees. A .section foreman on a railroad or a highway not only has full control of his men and directs them but customarily can “hire and fire” them. This is true also of a mine foreman, who ordinarily has hundreds of men under his direction. He ranks as an “employee”: Sec. 202. of Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915. Under the Act of .June 1, 1915, P. L. 716, a mine foreman has “full charge of .all the inside worMngs and the persons employed therein,” yet a mine foreman is not an independent contractor. He is legally “under the supervision and control of the operator,” though the latter may never even visit the mine and may be, and often is, utterly ignorant, of the .art. of managing a coal mine.

It may well be that Cease was not needed on the Bache job for that half day, and that he could be spared for that brief period to help another person in need of his services in putting in a new window. Thomas in his capacity of “foreman” might reasonably have taken it for granted that Bache would not object to his letting Cease “help out” for a half a day on another job, especially as it cost Bache nothing. We think it is not unusual for a foreman on jobs which are being done for an obliging employer (as Bache apparently was) to let one of his employees off for a short period to help someone in urgent need of help. Among the powers usually vested in any “foreman” is that of giving any of his men a “day off” occasionally.</p>

The claimant there was an electrician and his services were “specialized”; it was “to change the electric power mains in defendant’s plant.” That was obviously a job the defendant would know nothing about and would have no desire to attempt to control. As the Superior Court said: “The work was of the type usually performed by a specialist, and which defendant would not have-been qualified to supervise or direct.” In the instant case, the work done by Thomas, to-wit, laying shingles to a line on a roof and nailing them down, is about as commonplace work as carpenters are ever called upon to perform and if Bache had inspected the work he could have determined whether or not it was being done properly. In the Sechrist case the Superior Court said “when he [Sechrist] worked, was largely discretionary.” In the instant case Bache evidently expected Thomas to stay on the job. In the Sechrist case, those who assisted Sechrist “were never carried on defendant’s payroll.” The Superior Court said this fact is entitled “to some consideration as indicative of lack of intention to create the relation of master and servant.” In the instant case all four employees <em>were </em>carried on defendant’s payroll.</p>
