Appellant asserts as error the trial judge’s refusal to make a specific corrective instruction. The Assistant District Attorney said, “In order to find the Defendant, Vera Drew, innocent by reason of self defense, you must find her free from fault.” At the conclusion of the prosecution’s closing remarks, counsel for the appellant asked for a curative instruction, specifically correcting what had just been said.</p>
