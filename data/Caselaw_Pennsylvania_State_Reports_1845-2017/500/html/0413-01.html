On the afternoon of August 2,1978, the decedent came into the bar, picked up an envelope, and left.

Appellant was surrounded by a group of spectators; appellant’s cheek was bleeding and a broken knife was lying on the sidewalk about four feet in front of him. In response to a suggestion from <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>an unidentified onlooker, Bellizzie proceeded into the apartment building to investigate the second floor apartment. Once inside, Bellizzie found a wig, eyeglasses and a slipper in the hallway near the entrance. In the front bedroom, Bellizzie found the decedent lying on the floor in a pool of blood. While Bellizzie was investigating, appellant came into the apartment and tried to enter the bedroom where the decedent had been found. Bellizzie restrained appellant and, with the help of another police officer who had arrived on the scene, placed appellant in a second bedroom. Bellizzie then asked appellant, “What happened?” Appellant responded, “I know who did it.” When Bellizzie asked, “Okay, who did it?” appellant responded, “I did it.

Further, the evidence of appellant’s attempt to commit a robbery is sufficient to prove that the criminal homicide of the decedent was committed by appellant in the perpetration of a felony.

    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[257,779,1144,632]]]'>Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in allowing testimony concerning a sexual assault upon the decedent. The medical examiner testified that the decedent was found lying on the floor of her bedroom nude, except for a pair of socks and a blouse which was pulled up around her neck; that the tissues around the victim’s vaginal and anal openings were stretched, torn and bruised; and that these injuries were most likely the result of a sexual assault.
