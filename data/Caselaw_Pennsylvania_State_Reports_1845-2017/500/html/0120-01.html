    <p id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[182,490,1140,948]]]'>George Geschwendt lived across the street from the Abt family. On March 12, 1976, at approximately 8:30 a.m., he broke and entered the Abt residence. Appellant’s mother, with whom he lived with a brother, had gone to work. No one was in the Abt home, as all of the members of the Abt family had gone to work or to school. He had a .22 caliber gun and ammunition which he had purchased some time prior to March 12 and falsely reported stolen the day of the purchase. In the process of his illegal entry, glass from the kitchen window was broken. In order to avoid suspicion, he cleaned up the glass and placed himself in the house in a manner that made the kitchen door visible, while simultaneously he was able to observe the living room door to the outside. He patiently laid in wait for approximately six hours; then, consecutively, as five members of the Abt family and a boyfriend entered the house, he shot and killed them one by one. During this carnage, he also killed the family dog.</p>
    <p id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[183,1456,1139,897]]]'>The bodies of all the victims were pushed or carried into the basement. He also cleaned up the victims’ blood. The dead dog was obscured from the sight of anyone who might look through the window of the ground level cellar door, by articles of clothing. He placed all spent shell casings in his pocket. The purpose of these activities which occurred after each shooting was to ensure the inability of successive victims entering the house from being aware of the prior slaughters. When Margie Abt, one of the victims, came home he secreted himself and permitted her to complete a brief telephone conversation before killing her. Although two members of the Abt family had not returned, he left the house because the constant telephone ringing made him cunningly cautious. He returned to his home by a circuitous route, in a deliberate effort to avoid detection. The shootings occurred during a time span between 3:20 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</p>

He locked the motorcycle in the garage where it was usually kept. The next day, he drove a considerable distance to the Delaware River into which he discarded the shoes and gloves. He washed his pants and other clothing to remove the bloodstains and gave them to the Goodwill Industry. Three days later, March 16, he threw the gun, spent shell casings and the remainder of the live ammunition into the Neshaminy Creek which was nearby. The gun was later recovered by the police from the creek. While the shootings were taking place, he had worn ear protectors.</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[267,951,1148,783]]]'>Approximately a week after the Abt killings, the Bensalem Police asked appellant to come to headquarters for questioning about the alleged theft of his gun. On March 22, he was interviewed and given a polygraph test by police. The polygraph test showed that his answers were deceptive. At 7:45 p.m. the same day, he confessed, once told of the results of the polygraph test, giving a full and detailed description of the killing, together with the events and activities related thereto which had occurred before and after the shootings. After his arraignment that evening, he gave a stenographically recorded confession. He stated to the police that he was sorry he was unable to remain in the Abt house to accomplish his purpose of killing <em>all </em>of the members of the family. Two members survived as a result of his early departure.</p>

In response to the dissent of Mr. Justice Roberts, it needs only to be clarified that appellant in this appeal has not questioned the court’s failure to fully set forth for the jury the alternative verdicts. At no point in his argument does the appellant in any way intimate that the jury was not fully aware of the alternative verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. His complaint is most specific in his challenge to the refusal of the court to explain the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Thus, the dissent addresses an issue which is not before the Court nor is it supported by the record when the charge is viewed as a whole.</p>

Under the guise of proposing a “scheme most efficacious for this jurisdiction” for determining the retrospectivity of changes in “matters of purely state law,” the opinion propounds the very sort of “ambulatory retroactivity doctrine” that has recently been rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States for matters of federal constitutional law.

The opinion announcing the judgment of the Court suggests that this Court should “be guided by an examination of the history, purpose, and effect of the new rule, as well as the inequity and disruption that would be imposed by its retroactive application.” Yet the opinion’s limited analysis of the decision in <em>Commonwealth v.
