At trial, over defense objection, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence an inculpatory statement that appellee had given to police following his arrest in Niskayuna, New York on February 8, 1977.

First, appellee, who was sixteen years of age at the time of his inculpatory statement, had not been provided an opportunity to consult with an adult interested in his welfare prior to waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, see <em>Commonwealth v. McCutchen, </em><a href="/pa/463/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="463 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1708038" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0090-01">463 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="343 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="1708038,1708098" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0090-01,/pa/463/0089-01">343 A.2d 669</a> (1975); second, the Commonwealth had not introduced evidence from which it could be concluded under the “totality of the circumstances” that appellee had understood and knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.

Because appellee was arrested and questioned by New York police, who were not obliged under New York law to provide appellee with an opportunity to consult with an interested adult, appellant argues that the failure to provide such an opportunity should not bar admission of the statement. Appellant also argues that even if the lack of an opportunity to consult with an interested adult should have resulted in the statement’s inadmissibility at trial, this Court should abolish the “interested-adult” rule. We do not address these arguments, because appellant has not established its threshold challenge to the court’s determination that the evidence fails to establish a valid waiver of appellee’s <em>Miranda </em>rights under the “totality of the circumstances.”</p>

Police testimony established that five police officers arrested appellee at 6:00 p.m. at the home of his girlfriend’s parents, where appellee had been staying for a few days. Appellee was informed that he was being arrested as a “fugitive from <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>justice.” He was then handcuffed and transported to the police station in a police car driven by Detective Sergeant Nitchman. During the drive, Detective Pasquariello read <em>Miranda </em>warnings to appellee from a card,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> but did not have any discussion with appellee or elicit any response. Upon arrival at the police station, appellee was taken directly to the detectives’ office. His interrogation began at 6:20 p.m. and continued for an hour and fifteen minutes, until 7:35 p.m. Prior to questioning appellee, Detective Sergeant Nitchman removed the handcuffs and told appellee “that he could sit down.” Appellee was offered coffee, which he refused. Appellee was told that “he had been arrested as a fugitive from justice and that it was in connection with a homicide investigation.” The police asked appellee his age and appellee told them he was sixteen.

Appellee, indicating that he had read each line of the waiver form, signed the form and gave a statement.

In that case, the United States Supreme Court neither held nor said that a signature on a waiver form could never by itself satisfy the <em>Miranda </em>requirement that the defendant make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to remain silent.
