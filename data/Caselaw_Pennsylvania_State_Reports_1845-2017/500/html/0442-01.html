Appellant argues that the suppression court erred in permitting the use of a statement he made to an off-duty police officer to whom he surrendered. Contending that this statement was the product of custodial interrogation, appellant asserts that the failure of the officer to explain proper constitutional warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d 694</a> (1966) renders the statement inadmissible.</p>

In determining whether this conclusion is supported by the record, we “consider only the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses and so much evidence for the defense as, fairly read in the context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Coaxum, a friend of the appellant for at least two and one-half years, walked to the appointed location to meet appellant where Coaxum told him that the police and the victim’s family were looking for him; whereupon, on Coaxum’s advice, they began to walk the few blocks to the local police district station. Coaxum did not give appellant constitutional warnings, but did not ask any questions of him. While en route, appellant stated, “I didn’t mean to shoot the fellow, it was all a mistake.” The suppression court’s determination that the statement was volunteered and made without any compelling influence is amply supported by the record. Officer Coaxum testified:</p>
