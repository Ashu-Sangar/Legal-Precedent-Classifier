We granted review to consider the applicability of the limitations provisions of Sections 106(c)(1) and 106(c)(2) of the Act to the various types of no-fault benefits the legislature has provided in partial replacement of traditional tort damages for personal injury arising out of the operation of automobiles. Upon such review we have concluded that the legislature has provided comprehensive statutes of limitations in Sections 106(c)(1) and 106(c)(2), covering all no-fault benefits by drafting these sections on analogy to the statutes of limitations on traditional tort actions for personal injuries under our law, including survival actions and actions for wrongful death. Since appellant’s claim for “post-mortem” work loss benefits is barred by Section 106(c)(1) of the Act, we affirm the Superior Court.</p>

We have adopted this designation in this opinion for convenience, but without any implication that they are an additional category of no-fault benefits created by the Court. Such “post-mortem” benefits are not survivor’s benefits, designed to compensate certain designated persons for the damages they suffer as a result of the insured’s death in a manner analogous to tort damages available under the wrongful death provisions of the acts of April 15, 1851 and <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>April 26, 1855,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> governed in no-fault by the limitations of Section 106(c)(2), but simply continuing work loss benefits, designed to compensate the decedent’s estate for the loss the insured himself suffered by having his earning power cut off by death, in a manner analogous to the survival acts,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and so governed in no-fault by the limitations of Section 106(c)(1). Consequently, appellant’s argument that neither of the limitations on actions to recover benefits in section 106(c) of the No-fault Insurance Act applies to “post-mortem” benefits because these are neither “survivor’s benefits,” subject to Section 106(c)(2),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> nor benefits arising “otherwise than from death,” subject to Section 106(c)(1), must fail.

In <em>Wright, </em>the Superior Court did not address the wrongful death provisions of the Act of April 26, 1855 or the language in its own <em>Heffner </em>opinion noting that the persons entitled to recover wrongful death action damages, including the present value of services the victim would have rendered to his family if he had lived and his funeral expenses, “do not include the victim’s estate generally, but [are] the ‘husband, widow, children, or parents of the deceased, and no other relatives.’ ”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Having held that funeral expenses are neither “survivor’s benefits” subject to Section 106(c)(2), nor benefits arising from loss “otherwise than from death”, subject to Section 106(c)(1) within the meaning of the No-fault Insurance Act, the Superior Court in <em>Wright </em>concluded that neither the one year nor the two year limitation on actions in Section 106(c) was applicable to a claim for funeral expenses.

In 1895, Pennsylvania rejected this formalism with respect to limitations when the legislature provided that actions in trespass and trespass on the case would no longer be governed by different statutes of limitations tied to the form of action, but by differing periods of two or six years depending on whether the action sought damages for personal injury or property loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Since the benefits provided by our No-fault Insurance Act are clearly designed to reimburse injured parties for losses resulting from personal injury, we believe the more appropriately analogous general statute of limitations stems not from the old action in assumpsit, but from the actions in trespass and trespass on the case, involving injury to the person and the derivative statutes pertaining to survival actions and wrongful death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

It is therefore overruled. Both the logic of Section 106(c) and its historical antecedents compel the following construction: 106(c)(2) covers no-fault benefits, including funeral expenses which, like wrongful death damages, are designed to compensate the insured’s survivors for the loss they suffer by his death; 106(c)(1) covers other no-fault benefits designed to compensate the insured himself.</p>

Initial claims for survivor’s benefits under the No-fault Insurance Act are subject to <em>a one year </em>limitation under Section 106(c)(2) as were wrongful death damages when the legislature, analogizing to them, passed the No-fault Insurance Act. Work loss and other no-fault benefits belonging to the insured or a deceased insured’s representative are subject to a two year statute.</p>

It is, however, an anomaly continued by the legislature in no-fault actions, when it failed to change the one year limitation in Section 106(c)(2) of the No-fault Insurance Act to two years at the time that the Judiciary Act Repealer Act (J.A.R.A.) repealed the differing one and two year limitations on actions for wrongful death and personal injury and replaced them with the uniform two year statute in Section 5524 of the Judicial Code. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524. This remaining anomaly in the No-fault Insurance Act with respect to survivor’s benefits and those payable to the representative of an insured who is instantly killed is subject to correction by the legislature. The judiciary would create a greater anomaly and ignore the purpose of the No-fault Insurance Act if it were to apply the six year contract statute to such benefits.

Appellant raises here, for the first time, the argument that appellee should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense in this action because her insurance policy deceptively limited “work loss” benefits in a manner contrary to <em>Heffner’s </em>interpretation of the No-fault Insurance Act.
