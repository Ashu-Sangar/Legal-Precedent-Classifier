This testimony was clearly hearsay because it represented out of court statements made by appellee’s grandmother, which were offered to prove that appellee did indeed commit the alleged assault.

We find without merit appellant’s claim that hearsay evidence is admissible in <em>all proceedings </em>under MHPA on the theory that hearsay is admissible at the informal hearing required for an application for extended emergency treatment not to exceed 20 days. 50 P.S. § 7303(c). Appellee was committed for a period not to exceed 90 days pursuant to § 304, which requires a formal hearing to be held in accordance with due process standards. 50 P.S. § 7304. The legislature has determined that commitments for less than twenty days do not require the same formalities as are necessary in commitments for longer periods of time. This case does not require us to decide the propriety of the relaxed standards under § 303.</p>
      <p id="b209-11" data-blocks='[["BL_209.11",209,[208,1858,1106,422]]]'>Furthermore, appellant’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses necessarily implies that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. 50 P.S. § 7304(e)(3). Finally, considering the grave consequences of an adjudication of mental illness under § 304, it is imperative that the commitment court strictly comply with the rules of evidence generally applicable to other proceedings which may result in an extended deprivation of an individual’s liberty. The Commonwealth’s burden to present admissible evidence at the commitment hearings is small compared to the individual’s interest in not being deprived of liberty on the basis of inherently unreliable evidence. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel.

However, in view of the nature of the inquiry, it must be remembered that the best interest of the client in these cases is not necessarily served by striving to seek the client’s release. The mere fact that counsel failed to object to the hearsay evidence in this case without a further explanation as to why counsel elected to follow that course of action does not provide a justification for a finding of ineffectiveness.</p>
