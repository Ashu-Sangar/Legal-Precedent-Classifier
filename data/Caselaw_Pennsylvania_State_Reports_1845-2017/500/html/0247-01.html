It will serve no purpose to pursue in detail the perjoratives that would follow the intentional violation of Rule 305 because in the instant matter the prosecutor’s actions were neither deliberate nor injurious. The simple truth is that the witness’ identity, was in fact provided by the prosecutor, and he was called to testify <em>as a witness for the appellant </em>All that he could say was put before the learned trial judge with every opportunity that an unhurried and careful bench trial provides. Melino testified that he was working at a service station, attending a car that was a block and a half from the <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>scene. He heard what he described as “firecrackers” and about a minute and a half later observed a slow moving car with two occupants, the one on the passenger side having facial hair. Other Commonwealth witnesses, described appellant as clean shaven at all relevant times and occupying the front passenger side of a maroon Pacer. Hence, the appellant not only was provided a defense witness but, he used Melino’s testimony to his advantage in contradicting other Commonwealth witnesses. Thus, appellant fails to demonstrate that his defense was prejudiced by the Commonwealth’s alleged withholding of Melino’s identity. This is fatal to his claim of error under <em>Brady.

Orders compelling such discovery are left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B). Moreover, the scope of discovery under the rule must be consistent with the “protection of persons”. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 305, comment.

The testimony of the Commonwealth’s original witness, Joseph DiFillippo, went through many gyrations during the course of this litigation. Ultimately, DiFillippo recanted his position for reasons which the Commonwealth feared resulted from threats of physical force against his person. In view of this, the Commonwealth concluded that it was necessary to conceal Waddell’s identity to prevent a similar situation from affecting his testimony or endangering his well being, especially in view of his tender age. The trial judge addressed this issue at trial and concluded that the concealment was justified under these circumstances.</p>

Appellant argues that certain aspects of defense counsel’s trial strategy were influenced by the prosecutor’s assertedly misleading statements that only one witness would be called at trial by the Commonwealth. As a result of this alleged deception, appellant further argues, this Court is compelled to choose between a finding of prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., if the prosecution did not mislead the defense then defense counsel was ineffective for failing to ascertain the identity of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. To the extent that appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relies on the Commonwealth’s alleged deception, it is meritless. The record clearly indicates that the prosecutor, Mr. Murray, emphatically denied, contrary to the assertion of appellant, that he ever told defense counsel that the Commonwealth would produce only one witness. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony on Post Trial Motions, Vol. Ill at 3.53. Thus, there was no deception. Furthermore, our finding of no prosecutorial misconduct in this case does not compel a conclusion that defense counsel is not ineffective for failing to take action on the basis of information relating to witnesses of which he is unaware. <em>Commonwealth v.
