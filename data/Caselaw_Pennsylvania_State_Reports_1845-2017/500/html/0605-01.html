Lectromelt Corp., </em>wrongful death actions filed in connection with the explosion in 1971 of a vacuum degreaser unit which had been manufactured and installed by the Lectromelt Furnace Division. Before Pecor’s acceptance of the defense in these cases, an internal legal memorandum was sent to Pecor’s president urging that Pecor adopt the position that the indemnification agreement did not obligate Pecor to defend McGraw in negligence and strict liability <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>actions.

As noted by the trial court, it is apparent from Pecor’s defense of McGraw in several actions brought after the execution of the indemnification agreement that Pecor itself was of the view that the agreement bound Pecor to assume full responsibility for the class of actions now in dispute.</p>

Pecor maintains that the language of the release at issue in <em>Zimmer </em>and the language of the indemnification agreement at issue here are the same, but that <em>Zimmer </em>was wrongly decided.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Contrary to the assertion of Pecor, the agreement does not unambiguously <em>relieve </em>Pecor from the obligation to indemnify McGraw; rather, it unambiguously <em>requires </em>Pecor to indemnify McGraw in connection with all claims brought against McGraw as the former owner of the Lectromelt Furnace Division. In any event, Pecor’s contention is premised on an erroneous belief that a writing must be ambiguous in order to justify consideration of the parties’ post-agreement conduct.
