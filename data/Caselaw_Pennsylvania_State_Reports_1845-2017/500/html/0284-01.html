This writer in a concurring opinion expressed a willingness to accept the “same criminal episode” test as a matter of state law but rejected any implication that such a result was constitutionally compelled under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Mr. Justice Pomeroy, dissenting, did not disagree with “the same criminal episode” approach but rather dissented on the grounds that such a rule was not constitutionally mandated.</p>
      <p id="b338-10" data-blocks='[["BL_338.2",338,[311,2096,1112,267]]]'>However, in <em>Campana II </em>a unanimous Court accepted the “serme criminal episode” test for compulsory joinder since Mr. Justice Pomeroy’s dissent did not challenge the validity of the adoption of the same criminal episode rule under the Court’s supervisory powers. Moreover, Section 110 appears to have resolved the dispute between the proponents of the “same offense test” and the majority in that it adopts <em>both </em>theories. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. § 110(l)(iii)(A).</p>

Thus, the subsequent prosecution for aggravated assault is permitted under the exception found in Section 110(l)(iii)(A).</p>
