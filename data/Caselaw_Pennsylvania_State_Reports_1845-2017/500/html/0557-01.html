A presentment of that grand jury and resulting criminal complaints lodged against appellants were ultimately quashed on April 30, 1982 as a result of a finding that misleading evidence had been submitted to that jury by the prosecution. The Commonwealth sought review in this Court and by <em>per curiam </em>order of June 24,1982, we affirmed the action of the court below.</p>

The building, on February 11, 1980, was totally occupied by business and residential tenants. Appellants rented the first floor front store to conduct a women’s clothing shop called Capezio. On February 11, 1980 a fire in the shop was reported to the Philadelphia fire department at 6:18 p.m. Responding at 6:20 p.m., the fire department found a fire in the stairwell leading from the main storefront sales area to an office in the rear of the store. Two witnesses testified the fire was of incendiary origin.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[243,1033,1146,965]]]'>The Commonwealth asserted that appellants set the fire in order to collect fire insurance. That position was buttressed in part by evidence that judgments had been entered by creditors of the Krakowers and their corporation. Upon appellants’ application to quash before Judge Edwin S. Maimed, the supervising judge of Grand Jury III, it was established that of the $131,342.09 recorded debts lodged against appellants or their business, $120,372.11 of the judgments had been marked “satisfied” of record prior to the date of the fire, in some cases many years before the fire. This information, which was in the possession of the District Attorney, was not presented to Grand Jury III. Judge Maimed concluded that the failure to offer this clarification possibly left the jury with a misinterpretation which may have tainted their decision. It is to be emphasized that the quantum of the evidence presented before the grand jury to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case was not and is not being challenged.</p>

This argument suggests that the grand jury’s right to issue a presentment should be considered as an investigatory facet of the investigating grand jury’s powers. To state the argument establishes its absurdity. Clearly, the issuance of the presentment is nothing more than the result obtained once the investigative resources have concluded in establishing the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case. Moreover, it is to be recognized that the presentment itself is of little significance since the prosecu<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>tor could initiate the action, once probable cause has been established, by causing the issuance of complaint and information. In fact the argument of the Commonwealth merely highlights the abuse of the intended use of the grand jury process in this case.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[193,593,1142,1148]]]'>Traditionally, “[bjecause of the method by which its deliberations are conducted and the secrecy surrounding them, [the grand jury] is a particularly suitable body to investigate misconduct of public officials and public evils.” <em>McNair’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/324/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="324 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1171378" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0048-01">324 Pa. 48</a>, 57, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="187 A. 498">187 A. 498</a>, 503 (1936). Recognition of this important policy has been carried forth in the present Act as reflected in numerous references to “organized crime” and “public corruption” in various sections. As a corollary, the investigating grand jury has been given resources to enable it to investigate and gather evidence otherwise unobtainable in the absence of cooperation from witnesses and other sources of information. Central to the Act’s purpose is the <em>necessity </em>of the grand jury’s resources in order to adequately <em>investigate </em>and <em>uncover </em>criminal activity. Conversely, the normal law enforcement resources of the District Attorney’s office must be inadequate as a jurisdictional predicate to a submission before an investigating grand jury. In the instant case, as previously noted, the investigation is complete; no further evidence needs to be gathered. Here the Commonwealth’s intended use of the grand jury clearly does not fall within the area its use was intended to serve.</p>
