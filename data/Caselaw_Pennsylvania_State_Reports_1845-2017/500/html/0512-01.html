Acting upon complaints concerning alleged violations at the Lyncott landfill, received from both Susquehanna County (County) and a group of private citizens, DER conducted an investigation of the site. As a result of the investigation, it was found that certain violations had occurred and/or were occurring at the landfill.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The DER issued an administrative order dated <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>April 27,1979 addressed to Lyncott specifying the violations discovered and directing that Lyncott refrain from certain activities at the landfill site, and take certain other affirmative operational actions within a specified time frame. The County appealed the DER order to the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) setting forth .in its appeal that the water quality permit as well as the Solid Waste Permit of Lyncott should be revoked<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that Lyncott should be ordered to make full and complete reclamation of the landfill area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The waste approved for disposal in each instance involved materials not authorized under the original permit. This appeal also includes eight such approvals which, in each case, were issued in the form of an authorizing letter to Lyncott. The appellant-County appealed to the EHB from each approval granted and the appeals were dismissed for lack of standing on the part of the appellant. The Commonwealth Court affirmed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and a Petition For Review filed in this Court by the County was granted and consolidated with the previous County appeal from the April 27, 1979 order.</p>

The appellee DER concedes that the <em>Franklin Township </em>decision is dispositive of the issue of standing as it relates to the appeal from the issuance of eight separate approvals for disposal of toxic chemical waste at the landfill site.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It would be incongruous to hold that a county has standing to challenge the issuance of a waste permit, but lacks standing to contest amendments to an existing permit. The county’s role in protecting its substantial, direct and immediate interest in the environment could be negated by the issuance of a permit which meets with no county objections, and then the subsequent granting of amendments encompassing matters which surely would have evoked opposition had those same appended matters been a part of the original permit process.</p>

We disagree. The aesthetic, environmental and quality of life considerations discussed in <em>Franklin Township </em>are equally applicable here. It is not only the establishment of a waste disposal site, but the day to day operation of such a continuously hazardous and potentially dangerous facility which presents the environmental threat. The interest of local government — in this case a county — in promoting and protecting its environmental well-being and the well-being of its citizens is not any less substantial, immediate and direct simply because a perceived threat is posed by an operational order rather than the issuance of a permit. Once a permit is <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>issued, the efficient and lawful operation of a disposal site is of prime importance to the county of its locale. It would be a shallow right indeed if we were to hold that, on the one hand a county has standing to challenge the issuance of a permit for the operation of a waste disposal site within its borders, but, on the other hand it has no right to challenge official orders which directly relate to the operation of a landfill under a previously issued permit. The April 27,1979 order issued by the DER directly bears upon the manner of operation of the Lyncott landfill and as such is subject to challenge by the appellant county.</p>
