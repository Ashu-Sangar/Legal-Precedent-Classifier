    <blockquote id="b578-7" data-blocks='[["BL_578.7",578,[287,1520,1106,464]]]'>A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government.

    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[192,595,1138,523]]]'>The next factor to be considered is whether appellant made a timely assertion of his speedy trial right. On August 27, 1980, some 37 months after his post-verdict motions were reinstated, appellant asserted his right to a speedy disposition of post-verdict motions in the form of a Motion to Dismiss. This was hardly a timely assertion of his speedy trial right. Furthermore, it should be noted that once appellant’s Motion to Dismiss was denied on February 9, 1981, his post-verdict motions were disposed of within three months (April 29, 1981).</p>

Since appellant is unable to demonstrate any substantial prejudice from this delay, and the trial court’s denial of post-verdict motions took only 5 days longer than required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1122, appellant’s contention is without merit.</p>
