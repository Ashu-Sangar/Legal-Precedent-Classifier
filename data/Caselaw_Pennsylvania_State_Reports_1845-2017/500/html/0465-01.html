The property was acquired by Everett G. and Grace H. Rodebaugh on May 4, 1935 by deed from Edgar G. and Elizabeth H. Carlisle and has been the Rodebaughs’ residence since that date. On the tenth of November, 1976, the Rodebaughs executed an “open space easement in gross” granting Green Valleys Association, an association therein described as a public charity organized to preserve historical sites and natural scenic and conservation areas, a perpetual encumbrance, restriction and covenant to maintain Welkin-weir in its present scenic state, requiring that the “property shall be used solely for farming, residential or recreational <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>purposes or for such religious, charitable, scientific or educational purposes as might be carried on by an ‘exempt organization’ under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code or such amendments thereto ... as may hereafter govern such organizations.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Green Valleys Association, its successors and assigns, were given the right to enter upon the property “to inspect for violations of the . . .

These principles required the College, inter alia, to: (1) pay the appraisal cost for the easement given to Green Valleys Association, (2) “furnish full and first-class maintenance of the residence, contents and grounds according to standards at least as high as those previously observed, casualty and liability insurances, utilities, security patrol service on a seven-day, three-shift basis and special security services during public events or donors’ absence,” in conformity with correspondence between the college vice-president and the Rodebaughs, (3) submit any contemplated major physical additions to the Rodebaughs for approval, (4) submit the timing and details of all contemplated uses of Welkinweir and its facilities for the prior <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>approval of the Rodebaughs and (5) provide residence and ground staff satisfactory to and amenable to the direction of the Rodebaughs.

The record does not disclose the circumstances of Green Valleys’ creation, its relation, if any, to the Rodebaughs, or the methods by which its officers and directors are chosen. Even if its rights were sufficient to abstractly reduce the Rodebaughs’ present user below a life estate, these facts would need development. While there is no explicit language in the deed the Rodebaughs executed on May 31, 1977 to the college creating such an estate, the use of any particular phrases or words of art is not required in order to create or reserve a life estate. <em>Cheroka v.

The facts in the <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio </em>case are the reverse of the Welkinweir situation but the principle that the party in exclusive possession, occupancy and use of the property is liable for the payment of taxes is the same. In <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio, </em>the Commonwealth had condemned and acquired land to effectuate the relocation of railroad facilities which had previously been appropriated for the construction of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway East. When the new land was first appropriated and condemned, the Board of Assessment Appeals and Review listed it as owned by the Commonwealth and classified it as exempt from taxation. Subsequently, the Board listed the owners as the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and/or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and assessed the property as well as the structures erected thereon. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad appealed the assessments on the basis that real estate taxes follow the record owner; that the City of Pittsburgh lacked the power to tax real estate to which the sovereign holds title in the nature of a governmental function, and that the railroad held no estate in the land against which a legal assessment could be made. This Court unanimously held that the Commonwealth had no actual estate but a mere naked title to the property and, therefore, found the railroad subject to local assessment and taxation:</p>
