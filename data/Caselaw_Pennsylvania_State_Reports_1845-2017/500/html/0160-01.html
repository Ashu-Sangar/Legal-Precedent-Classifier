In a decree dated October 17, 1972, the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Orphans’ Court Division, gave appellee permission <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>to construct the proposed village, subject to the limitation that “no person, once admitted to the retirement village, will be obliged to leave the retirement village for financial reasons .... ” Construction was completed in 1974, at a cost of approximately $14 million, $6 million of which was financed, and $8 million of which was covered by “entry fees” from residents. The Village was opened for occupancy in September of 1974; full occupancy was achieved by May of 1975.</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[181,841,1140,479]]]'>The Village includes 35 “Country Homes,” 196 apartments, and a “Community Building.” The Community Building consists of an auditorium, meeting rooms, a kitchen, dining facilities, and a lounge. Each of the dwellings is fully carpeted and furnished with drapes and basic kitchen appliances. The Medical Center, which contains 25 beds, is open primarily to residents of the Dunwoody complex, although there have been instances in which emergency-room treatment has been rendered to members of the public.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[183,1358,1140,697]]]'>Each resident of the Village is obliged to pay an initial “entry fee.” Individual entry fees for the year 1975 ranged from $18,000 to $53,500, depending upon the size of the unit to be occupied; in 1976, the fees ranged from $22,000 to $59,000. Additionally, residents are obliged to pay a monthly charge for “care and service.” These charges ranged from $375 to $1000 per month in 1975 and 1976, and from $460 to $1241 per month in 1977. The charges cover the cost of what appellee terms its “complete life care” package — including meals, lodging, and health care at the Village’s Medical Center. The Village retains a right of subrogation against proceeds from health care insurance plans, including Medicare, whose coverage must be procured by residents.</p>

Although appellee does not require a statement of “complete <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>net worth” of applicants, appellee does determine an applicant’s annual income, apparently both from earnings and from investments. Appellee’s administrator acknowledged that it is appellee’s “philosophy” that qualified applicants must be “able to handle the responsibilities that they are about to undertake.” After a preliminary screening, qualified applicants are placed on a waiting list, which now includes over three hundred persons.</p>

Although the agreement gives appellee the option to subsidize a resident’s monthly charges, the decision to subsidize is solely within the discretion of appellee, and will be undertaken only if “such subsidy can be granted or continued without impairing the ability of [appellee] to attain its objectives while operating on a sound financial basis.” The record reveals that since the inception of Dunwoody Village in September of 1974, the Village has only once provided a subsidy to a resident.</p>

If an applicant fails to meet this prerequisite, the applicant will not be further considered. Subsidization of a resident’s required charges by the Village is a remote possibility, at best, as indicated by the fact that only one resident of the Village has been subsidized since the Village has been in operation. Even when the possibility of a need for subsidization arises, the decision to subsidize is wholly within the discretion of the Village, whose other options include the termination of the care agreement. Thus, on this record, it cannot be concluded that the charitable purpose found in <em>Presbyterian Homes </em>is shared by Dun-woody Village, a private housing facility which for all prac<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>tical purposes offers its residents no services beyond those which the residents demonstrate an ability to afford.</p>
