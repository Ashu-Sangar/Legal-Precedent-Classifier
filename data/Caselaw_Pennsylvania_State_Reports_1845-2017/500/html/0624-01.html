At the time of appellant’s arrest, police had found the body of the victim, a sixteen year-old boy, who had disappeared on <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>December 25, 1976. The body bore marks of sexual abuse. From investigation, which included interviews with appellant and the victim’s family, police knew that appellant and the victim had been together during the evening of the victim’s disappearance and had been last seen together at midnight. Members of the victim’s family had informed police that appellant had called them several times to inquire concerning the victim’s whereabouts. In addition, the victim’s cousin had told police of an unsuccessful sexual advance that appellant had once made toward the victim. This evidence, together with the fact that police knew that appellant had twice previously been convicted for sexually-related assaults on teenage boys, amply supports the suppression court’s finding of probable cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[208,1074,1137,936]]]'>Appellant’s second claim of error relates to a confession signed by appellant and introduced by the Commonwealth at trial. Appellant alleges that he never made the inculpatory statements contained in the confession, but that he signed the confession because of police coercion. At the hearing on appellant’s suppression motion, appellant testified that he had been severely beaten and had sustained a cut above his eye during his interrogation. Appellant also presented testimony that while in custody after his arrest he had related the same claim to a public defender, his brother and a member of the staff of a police abuse project. The court discredited appellant’s evidence and chose, instead, to credit testimony by police that appellant’s injuries had been self-inflicted. The court thus concluded that the Commonwealth had met its burden of establishing the voluntariness of appellant’s confession by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em><a href="/us/404/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="404 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="6174724" data-case-paths="/us/404/0477-01">404 U.S. 477</a>, <a href="/us/404/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="404 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="6174724" data-case-paths="/us/404/0477-01">92 S.Ct. 619</a>, <a href="/us/404/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="404 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="6174724" data-case-paths="/us/404/0477-01">30 L.Ed.2d 618</a> (1972).</p>

    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[252,672,1145,576]]]'>In his third claim of error, appellant contends that the prosecutor improperly suggested that appellant had been convicted of a prior crime by asking whether the reason that he had been a patient in a mental institution was because he had been “a sexual offender.” Appellant’s confession, which was admitted into evidence before the jury, graphically described appellant’s prior sexual relationships with younger boys. We are satisfied that the prosecutor’s passing reference, which did not refer to any specific incident or criminal conviction, cannot form a basis for relief. See <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, 410, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a>, 164 (1978).</p>

Judicial review, by either the suppression court or appellate courts, of claims such as appellant’s often centers on a swearing contest between defendant and police. A number of commentators, including law enforcement officials, have advocated the tape recording of custodial interrogations as a procedure which would aid police investigations, protect police against frivolous claims of abuse, and make judicial review of the voluntariness of in-custody statements more meaningful. See O’Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (1st ed. 1956). See also Kamisar, Police Interrogation and Confessions (1980); Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure § 130.4, Note at 39 (Official Draft 1975); Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 243 (Approved Draft 1974).</p>
