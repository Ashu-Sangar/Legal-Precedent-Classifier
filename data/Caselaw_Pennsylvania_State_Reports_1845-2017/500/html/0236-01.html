Compare <em>City of Philadelphia v. Masonic Home of Pennsylvania, </em>supra (home for aged men restricting eligibility to Freemasons not “purely public”).

Approximately $565,000 of the $590,000 total cost of the first facility and $3 million of the $4.3 million total cost of the second facility were financed by appellant. Similarly, cash donations have covered only a small portion of appellant’s day-to-day operating expenses, which include the costs of administrative and professional salaries, supplies, and utilities. Thus, both the cost of capital acquisitions and the cost of day-to-day operating expenses which have not been covered by donations have been passed along to patients, who have paid approximately 80% of the amounts billed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This high percentage of payment is attributable both to health care insurance carried by patients and the efforts of a debt-collection agency employed by appellant.</p>

This holding, however, fails to consider the proviso to section 204(a)(3), which authorizes specific applications of “revenue” — a term which includes funds earned by the rendering of services. Such funds may be applied not only to “support” the institution but also “to <em>increase </em>the efficiency and <em>facilities </em>thereofthe repair and <em>necessary increase of grounds and buildings </em>thereof ...” <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>(emphasis added).

This simply will not suffice. The key question in the second prong of the three-pronged test is not whether the institution’s activities comply with a definition of charitable purpose but, rather, was the institution begun or founded by gift, either public or private. The fact that appellant corporation is “non-profit” is not decisive of this issue. <em>See, Metropolitan Pittsburgh Nonprofit Housing Corporation v.

Roberts and Grilli in 1956 for a very low price, less than $40,000.00, was deeded to the Tioga Corporation (which is not asserted to have been non-profit and whose principal shareholders were Drs. Roberts and Grilli). A parcel of the original property was sold to the appellant West Allegheny Hospital, (a non-profit corporation whose incorporators were Drs. Roberts, Grilli, Shelhorse, Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Grilli) for a purchase price of $590,000.00 after having charged and received rent from West Allegheny Hospital for at least nine years. In addition to the huge profit in this transfer, it is also significant that appellant corporation’s first capital acquisition accrued nine years after its incorporation. The record does not support a conclusion that the founding of West Allegheny Hospital was by gift.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Such a conclusion is necessary to give this prong of the test any meaning.

Patients have paid or caused to be paid approximately 97% of the amounts billed for in-patient care and 80% of the amounts billed for out-patient care. In addition to payments from third-party payors, appellant has received huge federal sums and employs a collection agency for <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>outstanding patient accounts. The majority’s use of the word “revenue” in the proviso to section 204(a)(3) in order to overcome the blatant fact that Drs. Roberts and Grilli have passed the substantial operating costs <em>and </em>capital acquisition costs on to patients and/or the public without any significant accompanying gifts at founding or for maintenance is not in accord with the required strict construction of the statute involved nor the constitutional concept of a “purely public charity.”</p>
