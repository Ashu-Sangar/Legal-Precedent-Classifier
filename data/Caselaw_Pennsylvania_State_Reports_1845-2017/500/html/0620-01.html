    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[175,534,1142,1055]]]'>There is a vast difference between a permit invalidated for safety violations and no permit at all. Appellant obtained a permit by posting a bond guaranteeing against the damage the regulation is designed to prevent. His violation was against the safety regulations, not against the provisions aimed at regulating weight and preventing damage to the highway. To inflict a penalty for a violation already provided against by appellant’s bond is a harsh penalty and can be supported only by the clearest provision. The penalty under subchapter A for violation of the safety regulations is a $50.00 fine,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and the invalidation of the permit and possible prescription against future applications. The loss of a permit in mid-transit would itself be no small penalty to one who might thus be grounded with an unmovable load. The different penalties provided by the PennDOT regulation address different objectives, each designed to punish and prevent different wrongs. We hold, therefore, that the automatic invalidation of a permit by violation of the safety regulations is a penalty in and of itself and does not trigger all the penalties possible under the regulations.</p>

However, those citations provided no basis for subjecting appellant to a $20,250 fine under section 4945 of the Vehicle Code for an overweight-vehicle violation, as there is no indication of a legislative intent to deem a vehicle with a proper overweight permit to be “overweight” for purposes of penalty provisions merely because of unrelated safety violations.
