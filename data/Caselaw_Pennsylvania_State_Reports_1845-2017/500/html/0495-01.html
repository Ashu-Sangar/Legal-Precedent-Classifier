Therefore, the proper procedure should have been to permit the Commonwealth to file preliminary objections in accordance with our Rules of Civil Procedure, thereby giving the appellant the opportunity to establish the basis for his lawsuit.

The question is whether or not a court will be required to compel a responsive pleading before disposing of a patently frivolous action. Such a rule would unfairly place an economic burden upon persons who become the objects of Mr. Boyle’s litigious whims. It is apparent appellant has caused an inordinate consumption of the valuable time of an already overburdened judiciary, as well as the waste of precious tax dollars expended to provide a rational legal system. It should be unnecessary to state that due process does not require the courts to allow such nonsensical profligacy. The Commonwealth Court properly summarily dismissed the action and should be affirmed.</p>

    <p id="b554-11" data-blocks='[["BL_554.10",554,[232,757,1146,1258]]]'>The contents of this memorandum pertains to the description of the control mechanisms and the functions they perform on and within my Fiat automobile, a Fiat model X 1/9. I have brought two suits against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the removal of these control mechanisms. The first was dismissed in federal court and the second is now before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and it too may have a fatal defect as to the caption of the parties. I purchased this automobile from Cresko Motors, Market Street, Kingston, Pennsylvania on February 23, 1979. I will now set forth a description of those control mechanisms and their functions. The first control mechanism which I became aware of is the one that controls whether or not I am able to shift gears. I presume this mechanism is electronically controlled and when engaged it prohibits me from changing gears. This mechanism as well as the others that I will describe are used to annoy, harass and to intimidate and frighten me. At the discretion of the employees of the DPW they electronically regulate the amount of gas fed into the carburetor thereby directly controlling the speed of the automobile. There is also a mechanism that electronically shuts down the engine, stalls it out and I am unable to restart it until the employees of the DPW decide to allow me to do so.</p>
    <p id="b554-12" data-blocks='[["BL_554.11",554,[233,2061,1145,256]],["BL_555.1",555,[215,294,1140,1801]]]'>When these control mechanisms are used it is very frustrating, embarrassing and when used on interstate highways or in moving traffic very frightening. One day while I was driving Mom downtown the auto was stalled out in the middle of the intersection of Market and Ridge Streets, I <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>was permitted to restart the auto but it was then stalled out again in front of Three Duces and I was not permitted to restart it, this made it necessary for me to push the auto to the side of the street. It was embarrassing for both Mom and I; I returned later and was permitted to restart the auto without any difficulty. The auto through the use of these control mechanisms has been stalled out on numerous occasions on interstate highways in particular routes 80 &amp; 81. One day Mom and I were returning from the Allentown area via Route 81 when the mechanisms were used to stall out the auto in traffic and when restarted a mechanism was used to control the speed of the auto at speeds substantially below 40 MPH. The DPW then commenced a psychological harassment exercise. The auto was stalled out and had come to a complete stop; I was permitted to restart the engine but the auto accelerated slowly with sudden jerky movements, the car was then passed by other vehicles at a rapid speed that appeared to coincide with the jerky forward movements, and Mom was told, I believe, to lean forward in her seat. This exercise took place over a course of a mile or so of interstate highway. At the end of the exercise the auto was returned to my control and I was able to resume the journey without any further difficulty. This exercise and others like it occur at regular intervals and I believe they have sexual psychological significance. In another letter I will detail other and significant examples of the psychological manipulation of my mind. The most recent occasions when the above referred to control mechanisms have been used when Mom has been a passenger and witness to their use is as follows: On July 12,1981 while Mom and I were on a Sunday drive on Route 94 in New Jersey and again on September 10,1981 while returning from Woodrich via Route 239 and again on October 11, 1981 on Routes 239, 903 and 534.</p>

Their is <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>also equipment within the auto that dispenses narcotic gases, the effects of these narcotics will be discussed in another letter (October 12, 1981 was the last date this month the DPW administered gases to me while in my auto). Their is also a mechanism on the speedometer that when activated makes the speed indicating needle pulsate and I don’t know at what speed I am traveling. The gas gage also has a control so it also pulsates from empty to the full position when the control mechanism is activated. Recently I have detected another control mechanism that applies the brakes, it is currently being used to harass me. Another type of electronic mechanism installed in my auto pickups and transmits sound, its a ultra sensitive bugging device and I believe it is clearly illegal under Pennsylvania’s Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act 18 Pa.C.S.A. 5701 et seq. I believe while Mom has been in my auto she has received instructions from employees of the DPW, that these employees over hear the conversations that Mom and I engage in; that these conversations have been transmitted by this bugging equipment and not by any equipment that Mom has carried with her. I have been under electronic surveillance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for in excess of four years; this topic will be discussed in a separate letter. Since the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is on record as denying the existence of this electronic equipment, these control mechanisms and since these denials can be introduced into evidence in any future law suit that I may institute for the removal of this equipment, and in view of Mr. H.L. Olivieri’s letter to Judge Brominski dated September 15, 1981 (regarding suit 2766C of 1980, denial of legal counsel), I believe that under the present circumstances Mom should set forth in an affidavit her knowledge, detailing her past experiences and observations of how these control mechanisms function and any conversations she has had with DPW employees relative to these mechanisms, or the advance knowledge with which she was supplied with prior to their having been used when she was a passenger in my auto. I am on record that these control mechanisms exist, the state is on record that they don’t exist, again a close reading of the letter I received <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>from the Department of Transportation in July and Mr. Olivieri’s letter of September 15, 1981 is necessary to recognize that the Commonwealth has embarked on an exercise to discredit me.</p>

The farther the enemy from reality, the more real to them. They are sad and tedious occasions. Patient as a court may be, there must come an end, not only for the convenience of the court, but more specifically, for those against whom the proceedings are leveled. Persons are put to expense and discomfiture to answer complaints that are manifestly irrational, and to deny allegations that are the stuff of fevered sleep.</p>

Under the circumstances, I am almost reluctant to say, for it sounds a chord from Wonderland, that they can end only after they begin.

A question raised here is whether a court may do so sua sponte.</p>
