Appellant has raised twelve issues on this appeal. Appellant’s claims that the Commonwealth’s evidence was supplied by eyewitnesses who were so unreliable as to render the evidence insufficient to support the verdict; that admission of photographic exhibits C — 1 through C-9 without proper foundation was error; that the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Washington was improper; that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of disproving voluntary intoxication; that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of disproving Washington acted in self-defense; that the prosecutor’s demeanor during his closing argument was improper and prejudicial and that his statement should have been suppressed are waived. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s claims that it was error for the prosecutor to refer to flight during his closing; that he was improperly denied the right to question the jury concerning principles of law; that the court improperly denied a challenge for cause during voir dire; and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue an insanity defense and for failing to object to introduction of a photo<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>graph depicting him as a boxer have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed and found to be without merit.</p>
