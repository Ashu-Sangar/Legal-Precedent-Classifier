The permit was issued pursuant to an application received by the DER on September 11, 1979. It allowed and authorized the permitee to “stabilize and dispose of (using the ‘Stabatrol Process’ as described in the approved Facility Design and Operations Plans) neutralized inorganic sludges/residues with a solids content of 12% or greater, by weight, which do not contain (1) organic solvents, (2) sodium salts of arsenate, borate, phosphate, iodate, and/or sulfides, (3) more than 1% oil and grease.” The baneful deposits sanctioned by this license are acknowledged to be toxic wastes which perpetually retain their hazardous toxicity.</p>

Section 6002(1) declares that one of the main purposes of the Act is to “[establish and maintain a cooperative state and local program of planning and technical and financial assistance for comprehensive solid waste management.” To achieve this stated goal of cooperative regulation, section 6006(2) specifically obliges the Department of Environmental Resources to “[cjooperate with appropriate Federal, State, interstate and local units of government . . .,” and section 6006(4) obliges the Department to “[djevelop a Statewide solid waste management plan in cooperation with local governments . .. . ” Pursuant to section 6006(5), the Department is also under a duty to “[pjrovide technical assistance to municipalities, <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>counties, and authorities including the training of personnel.” These provisions make it clear that appellants, Franklin Township and the County of Fayette, have a direct interest in the means chosen by the DER to manage the disposal of solid waste materials, including the decision to grant a permit for construction and operation of a disposal facility within their boundaries.</p>

The cooperation between DER and local units of government mandated under the Act reflects the legislature’s recognition of the concerns of these communities and establishes the parameters of their participation. However, conspicuously absent from the Act are any provisions enabling the local units of government to exercise potential vetoes over DER’s judgment as to when issuance of permits furthers the statewide goal of environmental protection. The majority would rewrite the Act to enable local government units to intrude upon the ultimate authority vested in DER to establish a statewide solid waste management plan.</p>

In <em>El Rancho Grande, </em>this Court held that appellants, liquor licensees, had standing to challenge a determination of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to grant a liquor license, notwithstanding the fact that appellants did not come within any of the sections of the Liquor Code, Act of April 12, 1951, P.L. 90, art. I, § 101 <em>et seq., </em>as amended, 47 P.S. § 1-101 <em>et seq., </em>which set forth specific classes of persons and institutions who may appeal from the Board’s determination to grant or refuse a license. The underlying rationale for the grant of standing in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>was that without standing, appellants would have had no <em>input </em>in the decision-making process. However, in the instant case, the legislature has specifically provided (albeit not to the majority’s satisfaction) for the input of appellants in its scheme. 35 P.S. § 6006(2) and (4). Therefore, the reasons for extending the traditional rules of standing which justified the result in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>do not exist here.</p>
