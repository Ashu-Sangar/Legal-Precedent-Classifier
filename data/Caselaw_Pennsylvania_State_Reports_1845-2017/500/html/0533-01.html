Personal opinion that mandatory retirement is either unfair or not needed is of no consequence. It in no way dilutes the obligation of this Court to carry out a clear constitutional mandate.

Should the instant appointment be sustained, a retired judge who last ran for retention in 1975 will serve on the Board until 1987. For a period of eleven (11) years he will be authorized to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, free from accountability to the electorate.

To yield to the temptation of bending clear constitutional mandate, even where the motive is laudable, sets precedent for an erosion that will undermine our entire system of justice. This expression of my opinion is not in any way to be viewed as denigrating the value and the need for the pool of judicial manpower supplied by former and retired judges. I am fully cognizant of the high quality of judicial service rendered by our former and senior judges, on many occasions without compensation and often at great personal sacrifice and inconvenience. My dissent is compelled nonetheless because as valuable as this asset is to the system, it can only be used in accordance with constitutional direction. The will of the people as to how their government should function must be paramount.</p>
