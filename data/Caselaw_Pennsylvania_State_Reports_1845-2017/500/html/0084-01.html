At issue on this appeal is whether a motorist who has the minimum amount of liability insurance required by Pennsylvania’s financial responsibility law is nevertheless an “uninsured” motorist within the meaning of the statute whenever he causes an accident in which his insurance coverage is insufficient to indemnify the injured party for his losses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In these cases, even though the injured victim recovered some damages from the tortfeasor’s insurance carrier, the Courts permitted further recovery under the victim’s uninsured motorist coverage as to the difference between his recovery from the tortfeasor’s insurer and the minimum insurance coverage required by law. In each case the tortfeasor was deemed to be uninsured, within the meaning of the State Uninsured Motorist Statute, as to that difference. In <em>Porter, supra, </em>the plaintiff, along with four other persons, was injured in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of another. The tortfeasor had liability insurance in the minimum amounts of $10,000.00 for each person, $20,000.00 for each occurrence, and $5,000.00 property damage. The tortfeasor’s carrier settled with Porter and the others in the full amount of the <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>policy limits. Porter received $2,500.00. His damages were $10,000.00. Porter demanded $7,500.00 from his uninsured motorist insurance carrier which was the difference between his total damages and the amount he was paid by the tortfeasor’s insurer. His insurance policy defined “uninsured automobile” in exactly the same language as is in the Geico policy before us. The Arizona Supreme Court held that Porter was entitled to recover the balance of his damages — $7,500.00, under his uninsured motorist coverage.</p>

      <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>It makes little sense that a person can purchase uninsured motorist coverage of $1,000,000.00, be innocently involved in a catastrophic accident which causes him enormous damages, and then painfully watch his coverage effectively blocked by a tortfeasor’s $15,000.00 policy. I cannot agree that such a hit and miss, random benefits possibility is woven in the intent of the uninsured motorist law. It is unreasonable to believe that the legislature intended such anomolous results. The purpose of the Act is to provide insurance protection for damages which are suffered as a result of the negligence of another, and which damages are beyond any insurance coverage of a tortfeasor. The existence of a liability insurance policy and the limits thereof are not the critical elements. The key considerations are the actual damages suffered and the amount available for recovery. The primary thrust of the Uninsured Motorist Act is to provide a sound means of recompense for tortiously inflicted, uncompensated damages. It is not to provide paper coverage which evaporates when a tortfeasor produces a liability policy which provides or potentially provides the victim with compensation for his damages at something less than dollar for dollar. This was recognized in <em>Pattani v. Keystone Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/426/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="426 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="1908631" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0332-01">426 Pa. 332</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20A.2d%20402" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="231 A.2d 402">231 A.2d 402</a> (1967), where at the time of the accident the tortfeasor was insured by Wissahickon Mutual Casualty Co. and the injured party, Pattani, was insured by Keystone Insurance Company. Included in Pattani’s policy was uninsured motorist protection. Pattani sued the tortfeasor for the damages he sustained and recovered an award for $719.00. Before the tortfeasor’s insurance carrier satisfied the award, it became insolvent and went into receivership. We held that the insolvency of the tortfeasor’s insurance carrier occurring subsequent to the accident and the consequent inability to pay entitles the victim to recover under his uninsured motorist coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> This result recognized the innocent victim’s right to collect for his uncompensated <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>damages under his uninsured motorist coverage, notwithstanding that the tortfeasor had a policy of insurance at the time of the accident.</p>

If the answer is yes, then no uninsured motor vehicle, is involved. If, however, the answer is in the negative, I would hold that within the meaning of the Act, the motor vehicle is “uninsured” to the extent by which the damages suffered exceed any insurance protection.</p>

In some cases it is where the tortfeasor has no insurance, and in other cases it is where the tortfeasor’s coverage <em>available </em>to the victim is less than the victim’s damages. The cogent notion involved in an operative construction of the Act is the amount of the tortfeasor’s insurance proceeds <em>available </em>to the victim vis a vis the amount of the victim’s damages. It is not the mere existence of a policy of insurance, but rather <em>real </em>coverage as opposed to actual damages. In reality, an innocent, injured party who suffers damages of $30,001.00 due to the negligence of a tortfeasor who has a liability insurance policy with limits of $15,000.00/$30,000.00, is unprotected to a greater extent than a party who suffers damages of $15,000.00 at the hands of a tortfeasor who does not have an insurance policy.</p>
