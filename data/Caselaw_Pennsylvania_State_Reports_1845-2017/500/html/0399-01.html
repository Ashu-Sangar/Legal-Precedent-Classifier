Following destruction of the premises by fire prior to settlement, suit was brought by appellant to collect the difference between the estimate of the fire losses arrived at by the appellant’s adjuster and the estimate computed by the adjuster for the vendors. In entering judgment against appellant, the court of common pleas rejected appellant’s theory that appellant’s status as equitable owner of the property under the contract of sale required the vendors to use appellant’s more favorable estimate of loss when filing a proof of loss statement with the vendors’ insurers. We agree and hence affirm.</p>

Settlement was to occur on March 16, 1970, but was postponed when a dispute arose between the vendors and appellant. That dispute led to <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>legal action by appellant which resulted in the entry of a decree of specific performance by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia in favor of appellant. The decree was affirmed by this Court on appeal. <em>Partrick and Wilkins Co. v.

At the time of the fires, both appellant and the vendors had fire insurance covering the premises: Appellant’s insurance provided coverage in the amount of $130,000 for the building and contents; the vendors’ insurance provided coverage in the amount of $75,-000 for the building only.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although appellant did not attempt to secure an assignment of the claim of the vendors against their insurers for the proceeds of the policies, appellant did notify the vendors that it intended to assert a claim to the proceeds and that it had retained an adjuster who had estimated the amount of loss from both fires to be $116,-802.80. Meanwhile, the vendors had retained their own adjuster, appellee Ben Weinstein, who, along with the adjuster hired by the insurance companies, estimated the amount of both losses to be $78,564.58. This latter figure was used by the vendors in their proofs of loss.</p>

Appellant sought damages in the <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>amount of $116,802.80, the amount of the estimate of loss computed by its own adjuster.</p>

Because the vendee must pay the full contract price whatever the condition of the property, our case law has long held that, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>although a vendor is legally entitled to recover the proceeds of his insurance policy if the property is destroyed, the vendor’s equitable entitlement to the proceeds extends only to the unpaid balance of the purchase price; any excess is deemed to be held “in trust” for the vendee. See, e.g., <em>Dubin Paper Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em><a href="/pa/361/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="361 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="476386" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0068-01">361 Pa. 68</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.2d%2085" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="63 A.2d 85">63 A.2d 85</a>, 89 (1949); <em>Insurance Co. v.

    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[255,750,1148,1099]]]'>Appellant seizes upon the “trust” concept expressed in our cases to argue that, once property has been damaged, a vendor is obliged in his dealings with its insurance company to press for settlement of its claim on terms most favorable to the vendee, the beneficiary of the “trust.” However, this argument misperceives the scope of the vendor’s obligations. Because a vendor would obviously be unjustly enriched if it were permitted to retain both the full contract price and indemnification of a loss which must be borne by the vendee, our courts have imposed a constructive trust upon the vendor’s insurance proceeds. As this Court has often stated, a constructive trust is not a trust in the ordinary sense of the term but simply an equitable remedy designed to prevent unjust enrichment. See, e.g., <em>Buchanan v. Brentwood Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass’n, </em><a href="/pa/457/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="457 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="477766" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0135-01">457 Pa. 135</a>, 151, <a href="/citations/?q=320%20A.2d%20117" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="320 A.2d 117">320 A.2d 117</a>, 126 (1974); <em>Pierro v.

However, prior to that time, the vendors were in no respect unjustly enriched, nor did they become unjustly enriched by their conveyance to appellant of a sum less than that which appellant wished to receive. Indeed, if appellant’s view were to prevail, the vendors, <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>having no further claim upon their insurance companies, would be required to pay over $38,000 to appellant from their own pocket, even though they have received nothing more than the contract price agreed upon by both parties to the sale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

So, too, our holding does not prevent a vendee from obtaining an assignment of the vendor’s claim against its insurer for the policy proceeds and using its own estimate of loss in settling the assigned claim.
