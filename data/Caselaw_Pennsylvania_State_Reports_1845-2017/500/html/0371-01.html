Trimble &amp; Sons, Limited. As the Opinion in Support of Reversal acknowledges, appellant “purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state” by partially performing the contract with appellees in Pennsylvania. Appellant entered into a contract to transport goods manufactured in Pennsylvania from Pennsylvania to Canada. In order to take custody of the goods in Pennsylvania, appellant entered into a “trip lease” of its equipment with Coastal Tanklines, Limited, which authorized appellant to enter Pennsylvania for that purpose.

All appellee must prove is that the goods were contaminated when appellant made the delivery in Canada and that the goods had been in a satisfactory condition when appellant assumed custody in Pennsylvania. While the situs of an alleged breach, if known, is relevant to a jurisdictional inquiry, it is only one of many potential contacts between the defendant, the forum, and the litigation which may support jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">1</a>

It must be remembered that there are two separate and distinct contracts involved in this litigation.

The second contract, the focus of the instant jurisdictional controversy, was negotiated and entered into by and between Kingsley Canada and Trimble Canada. This contract contemplated two shipments of methylene chloride. The first shipment to be picked up by Trimble Canada in Indianapolis, Indiana, the second shipment to be picked up by Trimble Canada in Pennsylvania. The mere fact that the contract caused one of the shipments to be picked up in Pennsylvania, absent an allegation that the breach occurred during the sojourn in Pennsylvania, fails to meet the requisite contact under this prong of the test.

The Superior Court in its opinion emphasized in its cited cases distinctions between actions in assumpsit and actions in trespass. We believe that the analysis of whether minimum contacts exist is to be determined solely on the basis of those facts tending to establish the required relationships between the nonresident defendant’s activities, the cause of action and the forum. Although the facts as averred in a contract action may be different than those averred in a tort action, it cannot be said that an alternative standard of minimum contacts is required in one as opposed to the other. <em>See, e.g., </em>D. Currie, <em>The Growth of the Long Arm: Eight Years of Extended Jurisdiction in Illinois, </em>1963 U.Ill.L.F. 533. “To vary the minimum contacts needed for jurisdiction according to the character of the suit would lead plaintiff into disingenuous manipulation of their pleadings, and it would plunge the courts into ever more difficult refine<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>ments of the categories.” <em>Vencedor Mfg.
