After Dr. Schneider had testified <em>at length </em>as to the numerous tests he had made on appellant and had given his diagnosis of “schizoid personality with paranoid features,” defense counsel asked the following question: “[W]ith a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was the defendant’s mental illness of such an intensity at that time, at the time of the killing, that he was not mentally capable of fully forming the specific intent <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>which is required for a willful, deliberate and premeditated act?” (N.T.

A schizoid personality is an individual who is eccentric, may be referred to as queer in terms of, not his sexual preferences but his behavior, shy, oversensitive, usually detached, seemingly unemotional in the face of upsetting events and experiences. There is typically a défect in the capacity to form social relationships. There is little or no desire for social involvement. They are usually loners. They have few close friends, reserved, withdrawn, reclusive. They usually pursue solitary interests and jobs, often humorless, dull, cold and aloof.

Appellant suggests that, since Mrs. Donna Zettlemoyer had testified that the victim and her son had been friends, such “friendship” gives “rise to an equally <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>speculative inference that the slaying was primarily motivated by other factors — e.g., betrayal, mistrust, etc. — and not to prevent testimony against the appellant”. Brief for appellant at 70. This suggestion evaporates when exposed to the record. <em>All </em>of the evidence at trial and at the sentencing hearing raised the singular inference that the killing was motivated by appellant’s desire to prevent the victim from testifying in the Snyder County criminal proceedings. Not one iota of evidence can be read to raise an inference of another purpose — surely not the testimony of appellant’s mother that at one time appellant and the victim were “friends”. In the absence of a confession or admission by the actor, purpose and intention will, of necessity, require proof by circumstantial evidence and inferences therefrom. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth is not required to negate every <em>conceivable </em>inference within the endless realm of human speculation that is consistent with innocence. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">476 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">383 A.2d 503</a>, 507 (1978) <em>and Commonwealth v.

Such an interpretation defies logic, common sense, the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statute, and the obvious intention of the drafters who quite clearly were concerned with the type of frontal assault upon the criminal justice system of this Commonwealth as is presented by this case. The damage to that system is equally severe whether the executed witness be the relatively rare (in such cases) eye<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>witness or otherwise. Because the “General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable,” the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1), we reject appellant’s artificial dichotomy.</p>
    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[169,613,1141,950]]]'>For the same reasons, we also reject appellant’s closely related argument that the phrase “committed by the defendant” indicates a desire on the part of the legislature to impose upon the Commonwealth the additional burden of proving that the collateral “murder or other felony” must have been <em>actually </em>committed by the defendant. Such a burden would be unreasonable and frequently impossible of execution, because, by eliminating critical prosecution witnesses, a criminal defendant could make certain that the Commonwealth could not meet that burden. The criminal justice system receives a shocking jolt when a defendant flaunts the law enforcement authority of the Commonwealth by murdering a prosecution witness. The tremors felt throughout that system are extreme and are not diminished in cases where, <em>by that very act of murder, </em>the Commonwealth may be prevented from proving that the defendant actually committed the collateral crimes with which he was charged.</p>

The Commonwealth could easily have produced proof of the admitted convictions, but defense counsel’s acquiescence to the court’s proper interpretation of subsection (d)(5) rendered that proof unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

On this record it cannot be concluded that the Commonwealth has borne its burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, the presence of an aggravating circumstance which would permit the imposition of the death penalty pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d). Moreover, appel<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>lant has not had the opportunity to develop claims challenging the effective assistance of trial counsel, an opportunity afforded through the Post-Conviction Hearing Act to all defendants who receive judgments of sentence other than the death penalty.</p>

The parties agreed that at least one mitigating circumstance was present in this case: that the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1). Of the ten aggravating circumstances defined by the Legislature, only one was alleged by the Commonwealth to be present:</p>

On this record it is clear that there is insufficient evidence to establish all necessary elements of this statutorily-defined aggravating circumstance. The Commonwealth’s evidence showed only that the victim’s name had been read from a list of Commonwealth witnesses at the jury-selection stage of the trial of appellant on felony charges. The Commonwealth presented no evidence as to the nature of the victim’s proposed testimony at the felony trial from which the jury could conclude that the victim was “a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant . . . . ”</p>

Under the majority’s reading of section 9711(d)(5), the killing of an expert witness or a witness who provides only a foundation for other testimony would be within the scope of section 9711(d)(5) even though the plain language of section 9711(d)(5) requires that the victim be a “witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant.” This statutory requirement, easily met in much the same manner as an offer of proof, may not properly be disregarded.</p>

Where, however, as here, the Commonwealth has presented no proof whatsoever regarding the nature of the victim’s testimony, it is evident that the elements of section 9711(d)(5) have not been met. The Commonwealth having failed to meet its burden of proving the presence of an aggravating circumstance, the jury’s sentence must be set aside, and a life sentence imposed.</p>

A review of the record suggests that counsel’s strategy at the sentencing hearing may fairly be questioned: counsel challenged the existence of an aggravating circumstance pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5) purely on a legal ground, and made no effort to refute the alleged motive for the killing from a factual standpoint.</p>

Yet there is a serious risk that the writs necessary to meaningful federal court review could not be timely obtained. Alternatively, this Court could independently comb the entire record in search of questionable strategies and proceed to determine whether the strategies meet the standard of effective assistance established by our case law, see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="267" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967). However, such an approach is essentially a search for “plain and fundamental error,” a doctrine abrogated by this Court because of its uneven results and inefficiency. See <em>Commonwealth v.

There are facts of record which would support a theory that the killing was motivated by financial considerations and not by a desire to prevent the victim from testifying: appellant had incurred a substantial amount of debt before he killed the victim, and appellant was in possession <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>
      <em>of </em>a large amount of cash when taken into police custody soon after the killing. Although it is possible that counsel may have had legitimate reasons not to pursue this or any other alternative motive, it is equally possible that counsel’s reasons did not serve to advance the interests of appellant, or that counsel simply overlooked relevant evidence. Without an evidentiary hearing, this Court cannot determine whether counsel’s course of conduct was constitutionally effective.</p>
    <p id="b131-5" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[185,823,1140,894]]]'>Rather than abdicate responsibility to the federal courts, or purport to engage in a search for error on the basis of an incomplete record, this Court should fashion an appropriate procedure which assures proper inquiry into the effectiveness of counsel in death cases. One such procedure would require the appointment of new counsel prior to the direct appeal from a judgment of sentence, of death. Newly appointed counsel would be obliged to gather and to evaluate all facts necessary to the determination of whether trial counsel provided the defendant with effective assistance, and then to submit a petition to the court of common pleas in the nature of a petition for post-conviction relief, confined to the question of whether trial counsel was effective. The court of common pleas would conduct an evidentiary hearing on newly appointed counsel’s petition and, after making appropriate findings of fact, enter an order which disposes of the petition.</p>

Later, the court instructed the jury that the death penalty was required if an aggravating circumstance was found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt and there was either no mitigating circumstance or that the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating circumstance.
