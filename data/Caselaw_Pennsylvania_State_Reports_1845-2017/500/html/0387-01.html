We conclude that the record adequately supports the Commission’s determination that Brooks is fit, <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>willing, and able to perform the authorized services.

That application was granted by the Commission on April 20, 1978.</p>

The protests were based on the activities of an affiliate of Brooks, WFB, Inc., a company owned by William F. Brooks, Sr., who also owns 85% of Brooks. In 1974, WFB obtained a P.U.C. permit authorizing it “[t]o transport, as a class B carrier, property between various points in the City and County of Philadelphia.” Pursuant to this authority, WFB began operating an armored car service, transporting monies, securities, and other valuables between points in Philadelphia. On October 17, 1977, the Commonwealth Court held that WFB’s armored car service was not within the scope of the authority conferred by the property certificate. <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>

Although WFB filed a petition for allowance of appeal, it did not obtain a supersedeas of the Commonwealth Court’s order. Nonetheless, WFB continued to operate its armored car service in violation of the Commonwealth Court’s order during the pendency of the petition for allowance of appeal and for six weeks after March 1, 1978, the date on which the petition for allowance of appeal was denied. WFB finally terminated its armored car operations pursuant to a cease and desist order issued by the Commission on April 12, 1978. The protestors contended that the operations of WFB beyond the date of the <em>Purolator </em>decision in 1977 should be imputed to Brooks and should be deemed to render Brooks unfit to perform the services applied for. See 66 Pa.C.S. § 2503 (Applicant must be “fit, willing, and able to properly perform the service of a contract carrier by motor vehicle”).</p>

On the basis of this testimony, the administrative law judge recommended that Brooks’ application be granted. Although the administrative law judge found that WFB had not “willfully” violated the Commission’s authority, he made no determination as to whether Brooks had willfully violated the Commonwealth Court’s order. Following exceptions filed by Brinks, the Commission issued an order which adopted the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge and granted Brooks’ application.</p>

A majority of a panel of the Commonwealth Court (Wilkinson, J., joined by Rogers, J.; <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Craig, J., dissenting) agreed with Brinks and, accordingly, reversed the Commission’s order. <em>Brinks, Inc. v.

Although counsel for Brooks has throughout the proceedings attempted to take the blame for Brooks’ manifest disregard of the Commonwealth Court’s order, the record is clear that Brooks was made aware of the court’s ruling and understood its consequences.</p>

Our case law is clear that, although a favorable finding of fitness may not be based upon evidence of the quality of service conducted in willfull violation of a court order or the Commission’s authority, the mere fact of prior operation in violation of a court order or the Commission’s authority does not preclude a carrier from obtaining lawful authority in a subsequent proceeding before the Commission.

    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[263,642,1146,938]]]'>The record is clear that the Commission’s determination of fitness in this case was not predicated solely on evidence relating to WFB’s <em>post-Purolator </em>operations. Although all of the supporting banks had used WFB’s service both before and after the Commonwealth Court’s <em>Purolator </em>decision, most of the supporting banks testified on the basis of the interstate armored car service which Brooks had provided for them since the 1950’s. These banks classified Brooks’ service as either “very good,” “very fine,” “excellent,” or “top notch,” and stated that they would use Brooks’ intrastate service if the application were granted. In addition, three supporting banks — Continental, Fidelity and Philadelphia National — expressed dissatisfaction with existing service. As this evidence amply supports the Commission’s determination of fitness, the order of the Commonwealth Court must be reversed and the order of the Commission reinstated.

The justification for the rule permitting the acquisition of contract carrier rights despite past unlawful operations is evident. The essence of public utility regulation is to assure that the public’s needs are best served at the most reasonable rates. If past unlawful operations were deemed conclusive of an applicant’s fitness, the Commission would be powerless to grant the application of a carrier who, despite its past unlawful activities, has otherwise demonstrated ' its present fitness to perform services beneficial to the public. Such an automatic disqualification, moreover, would improperly view the Commission’s statutory obligation to determine an applicant’s fitness prior to granting a contract carrier permit as a punitive measure directed against the individual wrongdoer rather than as a safeguard, the primary purpose of which is the protection of the public.
