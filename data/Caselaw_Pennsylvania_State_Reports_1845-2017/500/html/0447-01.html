Manusov directed that “rent, income and profits” from the premises were to be applied to “taxes, insurance, cost of maintenance and other expenses in connection with the management of said property.” Manusov further directed the payment of $200 per month to himself for the rest of his life, $300 per year “[t]o each of the Grantees or their survivors and successors,” up to $50 per week to “Grantees, Trustees, or their issue or any member of their respective families” for care and maintenance “in the event of sickness <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>or need,” such educational expenses of children of the trustees as appropriate, and $1,000 as a wedding gift to each trustee’s child who should marry.

This request was made by the four plaintiffs in their capacity as “Trustees of [the] Manusov Family Trust.” The second count contained a request for a judgment of $100,000, the amount of coverage on the contents of the building. This request was made by the four plaintiffs in their capacity as “Trustees Under the Will of Charles Kracoff,” and by Harry Kracoff “in his own right.” Appellee filed an answer and new matter, the latter of which averred that in the sworn proofs of loss Harry Kracoff had deliberately concealed the true origin of the fire with intent to defraud appellee, in violation of the “Concealment, Fraud” provision of the insurance policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellee further averred that it was not liable for the losses under the “Perils Not Included” clause,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and added that plaintiffs had, “in fact, intentionally and deliberately caused or contributed to the cause of such fire and any consequent loss.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On October 3, 1978, shortly before trial, Harry Kracoff resigned as a trustee of the Manusov Family Trust, “effec<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>tive immediately.” That same day he executed a “Release and Disclaimer,” which stated that he renounced and disclaimed “all right, title and interest of any kind which I ever had, now have or may have in the future in said Trust as a beneficiary thereof.” Nathan Petrushansky, one of the other co-trustees, died on October 13,1978, also before trial. As a result of Harry Kracoff s resignation and Nathan Petrushansky’s death, Doris Kracoff and Sara Stark were the remaining co-trustees of the Manusov Family Trust.</p>

In its opinion, the court concluded from the evidence presented by appellee that the fire had been a “setup” arranged by an “insider,” rather than by “an angry outside person,” as Harry Kracoff had maintained. Having determined that there were “only two suspects,” Harry Kracoff and his son-in-law Leon Bryn, both of whom had been present at the store throughout the day of the fire, the court concluded that the fire had been started solely by Harry Kracoff.</p>

Having concluded that the remaining co-trustees were bound by Harry Kracoffs conduct, the court went on to state that “we do not see how any future beneficiaries of the trust have independent standing.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Plaintiffs filed timely exceptions to the adjudication in their capacity as co-trustees under the Manusov Family <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>Trust. The exceptions did not dispute the court’s finding that the fire had been started by Harry Kracoff, but did dispute the court’s determination that all interests were bound by Harry Kracoff’s wrongful act, including the interests of “minors and unborn remaindermen.” In an opinion dated February 2,1979, dismissing the exceptions, the court concluded that the remaindermen were “innocent,” but perceived the remaindermen as “natural objects of [the] bounty of Harry Kracoff and his co-trustees” whose right to recover was dependent upon the right to recover of Harry Kracoff and the co-trustees.</p>

Appellee’s right to retain the shares of Harry Kracoff and his “children or issue” is in no respect dependent upon the “Release and Disclaimer” executed by Harry Kracoff on October 3, 1978, the day on which he resigned as trustee. Rather, appellee’s right to retain these shares gives full <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>effect to “the common law principle that a person will not be permitted to profit by his own wrong, particularly his own crime.” <em>Greifer Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="333 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1187900" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0278-01">333 Pa. 278</a>, 279, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20118" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 A.2d 118">5 A.2d 118</a>, 119 (1939).</p>

The policy issued by appellee provided insurance on properties owned by the “Manusov Family Trust, Harry Kracoff, Trustee, and Harry Kracoff, A.T.I.M.A.,” the latter a shorthand for “as their interests may appear.” See <em>New Hampshire Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>American Employers Insurance Co., </em><a href="/kan/208/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="208 Kan. 532" data-case-ids="61036" data-case-paths="/kan/208/0532-01">208 Kan. 532</a>, 533, <a href="/kan/208/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="208 Kan. 532" data-case-ids="61036" data-case-paths="/kan/208/0532-01">492 P.2d 1322</a>, 1324 (1972). It is clear from the findings of the court of common pleas that Harry Kracoff acted alone in setting the fire, without any assistance from the other co-trustees, who were also income beneficiaries under the terms of the Trust, or from any “children or issue” of the designated co-trustees. Absent evidence that the other beneficiaries assisted in or approved of Harry Kracoff’s wrongful conduct, there is no basis for prohibiting recovery by the other beneficiaries.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[171,1486,1139,871]]]'>Contrary to the determination of the court of common pleas, the wrongful conduct of Harry Kracoff may not fairly be imputed to the entire Trust, as nothing in the trust instrument even remotely contemplated that any portion of the corpus might be deliberately destroyed by fire. Nor may Harry Kracoff’s wrongful conduct fairly be imputed to the other beneficiaries on the theory that they acquiesced in his assumption of control over the family’s business affairs. “A trustee as such is not an agent of the beneficiary .. . . ” Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 276 Comment a (1959). Although over the years of the administration of the Trust the other trustee-beneficiaries permitted Harry Kracoff to assume progressively more responsibilities under the Deed of Trust, including the responsibility to procure insurance on the trust property, appellee has failed to establish that Harry Kracoff became the agent of any of the other beneficiaries for all purposes.</p>

The conduct of Harry Kracoff was wholly unilateral and in no way may be deemed to be an act of the Trust itself.</p>

If the proceedings to terminate the Trust are still pending, appellee should be permitted to appear and to protect its interests; if those proceedings have been terminated and a final decree entered, the decree of the orphans’ court may be opened to the extent necessary to assist the court of common pleas in entering a fair adjudication in this case.</p>
