We are satisfied after reviewing the record that there is no basis upon which to disturb these findings. Nothing in the record supports the contention that Novelty established the existence of a course of conduct or representations justifying its reasonable expectation that <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>Bernette would place an order directing Novelty to process the stored five tons of yarn.</p>
    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[230,472,1139,739]]]'>The record reveals Mr. Gripp, Novelty’s president at the time, believed that agreeing to store the yarn would generate “a good business relationship”. When asked whether he expected Bernette to order the five tons of yarn to be fabricated into sweaters, Mr. Gripp replied that he regarded this only as “a possibility”. Not only did he state that no specific order was guaranteed but he admitted that no oral agreement had been reached as to any specific garment with respect to style or price. When the trial judge asked Mr. Gripp whether agreements on style and price were prerequisites to a commitment, he responded in the affirmative. Thus, the record does not indicate that Bernette induced Novelty nor does it support Novelty’s claim that it justifiably relied on any such inducement.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[231,1240,1139,471]]]'>Novelty’s assertion that its bankruptcy was caused by Bernette’s failure to place the order in question is also belied by the facts contained in the record. When asked whether he did not accept other work in anticipation of Bernette’s order, Mr. Gripp answered emphatically in the negative. He also indicated that anticipation of Bernette’s order was not the only reason that “key help” was retained. This work force was also needed so that Novelty would remain prepared to meet other potential contracts.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[228,1741,1137,576]],["BL_488.1",488,[240,326,1141,96]]]'>The burden of proof under <em>Blofsen </em>requires clear, precise and unequivocal evidence to support the elements of equitable estoppel. We must agree with the courts below that Novelty has failed to meet this burden. Rather than showing that Bernette induced Novelty to rely on a promise never delivered, our review of the record shows that Novelty’s claims amount to little more than speculation to support an illusory promise. This is particularly apparent when viewing Novelty’s assertion that its bankruptcy was caused by Bernette’s failure to order the five tons of yarn to be fabricated into sweaters. Mr. Gripp identified the deteriora<a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>tion of the market and outdated equipment among the causes of his company’s decline.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[238,443,1142,363]]]'>Thus, it was well known to Novelty that its uncompetitive position and the general condition of the clothing business in the 1968-69 period were factors in creating the financial instability from which Novelty suffered. The claim that Bernette’s order would have prevented Novelty’s bankruptcy is, therefore, pure conjecture and, as such, it fails to meet the unequivocal evidence standard of <em>Blofsen.</em>
