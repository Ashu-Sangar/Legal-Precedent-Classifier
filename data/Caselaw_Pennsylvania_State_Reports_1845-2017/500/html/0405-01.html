In the early part of that month, appellant stated to a friend, Brenda Cropper, that he intended to kill the deceased, Willie “Omar” Tinsley. The cause of the animosity was Tinsley’s intrusion upon appellant’s business interests. At the residence where appellant’s illicit business was being conducted, Tinsley was shot and killed on March 20,1979. Tinsley died from shotgun wounds fired by Frank Jenkins in the presence of appellant. Appellant assisted in the disposal of the body and arranged for the concealing of the murder weapon. A few days after the incident, appellant admitted to a friend, ■ Butler Branch, that he had killed Tinsley, and admonished him not to disclose that confidence. The cause of death was determined to have been a shotgun blast from a distance of three (3) to five (5) feet to the face of the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
