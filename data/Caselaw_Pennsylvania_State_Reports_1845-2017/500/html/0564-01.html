      <em>Id. </em>485 Pa. at 446 n. 4,402 A.2d at 1356 n. 4 (Mr. Justice Nix, dissenting). It is the function of the judiciary at every level to decide cases impartially and without regard to political considerations. Furthermore, although judges are chosen in a political forum, a judge’s further participation in party politics is forbidden expressly by Pa. Const. Art. 5, § 17(a), which proscribes a judge’s holding office in political parties or organizations, and implicitly by § 17(b), which proscribes activity violative of the canons of judicial conduct, as Canon 7 of the Code of Judicial Conduct admonishes jurists to abstain from political activity. Thus any legislative regulation of membership on a court according to political party affiliation must necessarily involve a useless purpose. Any suggestion that jurists decide matters before them based on party politics is an affront to the dignity and integrity of <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>the Judiciary; and any encouragement to judicial officers to actively participate in political activities is condemned.</p>

The Commonwealth Court was <em>constitutionally </em>mandated in 1968, Pa. Const. Art. 5, § 4, as a part of the unified judicial system, Pa. Const. Art. 5, § 1. The implementing legislation necessary to create the court, Act of January 6, 1970, 1969 P.L. 434, No. 185, provided a method of gubernatorial appointment of the initial seven judges in a manner guaranteeing minority party representation on the Court. The legislative history of the Act, however, is totally void of any basis, for continued minority party representation. The constitutional provision prescribing the manner of <em>election </em>of judges, Pa. Const. Art. 5 § 13(a) makes no distinction among the statewide courts. I think it is abundantly clear that according to the constitution the manner of election of judges to the Commonwealth Court is to differ in no way from the manner of election of the members of the other courts of this Commonwealth, thus retaining the integrity of a unified judicial system. The <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>attempt by the legislature in Section 3133 to carry the minority party representation “guarantee” of the initial appointment over to later elections runs contrary to the constitutional mandates of Art. 5, Sections 1, 4, arid 13, and is an infririgement on the independence of the judiciary.</p>
