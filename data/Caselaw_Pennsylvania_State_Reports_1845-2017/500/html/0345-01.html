Unlike the scheme of the current Crimes Code where there is only one statutory crime of robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701, the Penal Code at the time of appellants’ crimes defined various types of robbery in four separate sections: “robbery and robbery by assault and force”, 18 P.S. § 4704; “robbery with accomplice or while armed or by violence”, 18 P.S. § 4705; “robbery of bank vaults”, 18 P.S. § 4706; and “train robbery”, 18 P.S. § 4707.

Appendix). The lower court’s sentence of five to ten years for “armed robbery” was well within the legislative parameters of punishment. The legislature is also acting completely within permissible constitutional bounds in deciding that the use of a <em>firearm </em>in that crime of violence (as well as other specifically enumerated crimes of violence), poses an additional, serious threat to society, and warrants the imposition of an additional penalty. Again, the sentencing court did no more than impose the punishment authoriz<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>ed — indeed, mandated — by the legislature in sentencing appellants to additional consecutive terms of imprisonment of five to ten years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

However, since appellant Bostic has properly raised the issue in his PCHA petition and hearing, we will not review the “waiver” disposition in Bradby’s case but will instead, given the disposition of the double jeopardy claim, treat the issue in that case as having been preserved for purposes of discussion.</p>
