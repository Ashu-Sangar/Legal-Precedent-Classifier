However, because the remedies provided by a collective bargaining agreement, more often than not, are controlled by the union and employer, “they may prove unsatisfactory or unworkable for the individual grievant”. <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em><a href="/us/386/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="386 U.S. 171" data-case-ids="6169888" data-case-paths="/us/386/0171-01">386 U.S. at 184</a>, <a href="/us/386/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="386 U.S. 171" data-case-ids="6169888" data-case-paths="/us/386/0171-01">87 S.Ct. at 914</a> (1967). The question that arises then is whether there are instances where an individual employee may obtain judicial review of a breach of contract claim against the employer notwithstanding the failure to exhaust contractually provided remedies.</p>
    <p id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[267,1407,1147,947]],["BL_385.1",385,[193,322,1140,727]]]'>I believe such an instance exists where an employee seeks enforcement of contractual rights and a union, which possesses the exclusive power to invoke the higher stages of the grievance procedure, prevents the employee from exhausting the contract remedies by wrongfully refusing to process the grievance. In such a situation an employee is forced into an untenable position. The employee has a grievance against the employer for breach of contract. Under the terms of the contract which the employer has breached, the employee is restricted to seeking relief within the remedial procedures established by the agreement. Such employee, thus, cannot pursue, on his own, the contract remedies to the fullest extent. Under the agreement, the employee must rely on the union to prosecute his grievance. If the union breaches its obligation by wrongfully refusing or neglecting to pursue the grievance, then the aggrieved employee would be left without an effective remedy as to the employer. He would have a theoretical remedy and yet be deprived of the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>means of enforcement. This is the plight of the appellant in this case. She alleges that her employer has wrongfully discharged her in violation of the collective bargaining agreement. The agreement which she claims the Commonwealth violated restricts her pursuit of a remedy to the procedure established therein. Further, that same agreement provides that only the union may prosecute a grievance at the arbitration level. Additionally, she alleges that the union has wrongfully failed to proceed with arbitration on her behalf. As a result, she is unable to pursue the remedy she seeks within the procedures established by the contract. In short, she was prevented from exhausting her contractual remedies by alleged wrongful conduct on the part of the union.</p>
    <blockquote id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[230,1064,1099,1000]]]'>“It is true that the employer in such a situation may have done nothing to prevent exhaustion of the exclusive contractual remedies to which [the employer] agreed in the collective bargaining agreement. But the employer has committed [an alleged] wrongful discharge in breach of that agreement, a breach which could be remedied through the grievance process to the [employee’s] benefit were it not for the union’s breach of its [duty to represent the employee fairly in the grievance process]. To leave the employe remediless in such circumstances would, . . . be a great injustice. We cannot believe that [the legislative intent], in conferring upon employers and unions the power to establish exclusive grievance procedures, was to confer upon unions such unlimited discretion to deprive injured employees of all remedies for breach of contract. Nor do we think that the [legislative intent] was to shield employers from the natural consequences of their breaches of bargaining agreements by wrongful union conduct in the enforcement of such agreements”.</blockquote>
