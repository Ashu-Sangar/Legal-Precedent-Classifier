A number of objections have been raised by appellant challenging his dismissal. We granted review to address the question as to whether the procedures employed in the decision-making process violated his constitutional rights to procedural due process and a fair hearing.

Three levels of disciplinary proceedings exist and the level of proceedings is determined according to the severity of the alleged breaches of the rules and regulations. Disciplinary action is instituted when a member’s superior or supervisor draws up a disciplinary action report (DAR) specifying certain charges against the member. After the DAR is completed, a copy is given to the accused member. For “first level” charges, an informal hearing is held by an “approval officer,” usually a division director or troop commander. At this first level informal hearing before the approval officer, the charges are discussed and the member may present any relevant facts. The punishment for a finding of a first level infraction is either a written reprimand or disciplinary training anywhere from 5 to 20 duty days. A right of appeal to the next level is also provided.</p>

A member may have counsel or a <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>representative present at a second level hearing, but counsel or the representative is not given the right to actively participate in the proceedings. The punishment for a finding of second level infractions may range from 1 to 30 days suspension without pay.</p>
      <p id="b246-7" data-blocks='[["BL_246.2",246,[315,1930,1114,420]]]'>Third level charges brought against a member are first heard by the appropriate disciplinary hearing board to determine if sufficient cause exists to warrant the convening of a court martial board. If a court martial board is approved, the disciplinary board will determine the duty status of the member pending the outcome of the case. The court martial board adjudicates all third level charges against a member who has the right of active representation of counsel. After hearing of third level charges, the court martial board makes findings and recommendations to the Commissioner who may in his discretion follow or disregard the recommendations of the court martial board.</p>

We recognize that one of the features of the disciplinary scheme was to provide the possibility that the Commissioner may have given greater weight to certain mitigating factors and on that basis rejected the recommendation of dismissal. This, however, is counterbalanced by the fact that the scheme would have also permitted the Commissioner to have taken a harsher view than the one recommended by the Board. By eliminating consideration of the Commissioner’s decision, we have avoided the possibility that he may have been influenced adverse to Mr. Soja because of unrecorded information. In our review of the record in this matter, we have looked with great care for any mitigating factors which would have justified the imposition of a discipline less severe.</p>

Thus, for the sake of correcting a speculative harm in those few cases which will result in court-martial proceedings, the opinion of Mr. Justice Nix would require the Commissioner to ignore reports of all disciplinary concerns as they arise, thus substantially impairing the Commissioner’s essential authority as “the head and executive officer of the Pennsylvania State Police.” 71 P.S. § 251(a). With an incomplete awareness of the disciplinary problems in the force under his command, the Commissioner of Pennsylvania State Police would be unable to carry out effectively his statutory duties to “make rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Governor, prescribing <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>qualifications prerequisite to, or retention of, membership in the force; for the enlistment, training, discipline, and conduct of the members of the force; for the selection and promotion of such members on the basis of merit; for the filing and hearing of charges against such members, and such other rules and regulations as are deemed necessary for the control and regulation of the State Police Force.” 71 P.S. § 251(a).</p>

By suggesting that the Pennsylvania State Police should “make any information received by this [preliminary investigation] process a part of the record so that the charged trooper as well as a reviewing tribunal will be aware of it,” the opinion would implicitly allow the Commissioner to rely upon information beyond that which he is statutorily authorized to consider. Although the charged trooper would be “aware” of the information once the Commissioner had placed it on the record, he would have no opportunity to respond through the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, as he is able to respond to all issues raised at the court-martial hearing. Without the support of an adequate record, this information, which otherwise should never have been considered, would be of little, if any, use to a complaining trooper on appeal, where the reviewing court would be obliged to sustain the Commissioner’s decision if there is substantial evidence of the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
