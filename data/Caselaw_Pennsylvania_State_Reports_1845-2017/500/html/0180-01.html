These are hardly the words of driven epigones of Lord Coke. If the majority opinion in this case did no more than give a new source to supply sufficient consideration for an accord and satisfaction and provide a rule to enforce it, our time would have been well spent.</p>

Tracing its provenance to old Lord Coke’s Reports the majority finds that “it may still have sound psychological roots in the content of executory promises” which I gather to mean, maybe it does not. See Majority Opinion at 110. I see no reason, in passing, to throw doubt on a settled principle of law, while saying “our law should neither invite litigation nor encourage its continuance.” <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 110.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[188,746,1139,629]]]'>This is a case of an unfaithful servant and the majority rightly holds that he was invested with apparent authority. While a master must answer for loss inflicted by one wearing his apparent authority, that loss must be a legal one. If Mr. Smallhoover did- not give legally sufficient consideration under existing law, he suffered no loss, for he gave only what he was obliged to give. He did not give legally sufficient consideration unless he paid a lesser sum for a genuinely disputed debt. In his answer to the motion to strike, he raised that very issue; he argued that the original judgment was induced by fraud. He obviously knew the requirements of the rule and responded accordingly.</p>

To my mind, under all the facts of this case, it is an injustice to alter or change that rule on the parties hereto. I would strike the “satisfaction” and remand the case to the court of common pleas to determine whether there was an accord and satisfaction under the long-standing law.</p>

I agree that appellants (Small-hoover) must be given credit for the $15,000.00 paid to prior counsel, Harry E. Walk, and counsel of record, Lawrence May, for appellee (Hazelwood) albeit the $15,000.00 was not received by Hazelwood. However, since appellants purchased goods from appellee and failed to pay for those goods, the majority’s decision is a $57,372.65 boon (the un<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>paid balance minus the $15,000.00 paid to Walk and May) to Smallhoover.</p>

However, the present case in controversy is not the appropriate instance where modification is either warranted or proper. As valid as the majority’s simile of the Uniform Written Obligations Act, Act of May 13, 1927, P.L. 985, § 1, 33 P.S. § 6, may appear to be on first reading, close scrutiny reveals it inopposite to the instant case since that Act applies to signers, rather than binds principals of the agents who have signed they “intend to be legally bound.” 33 P.S. § 6; <em>Hoober v. Charles, </em>42 Lane. 673 (1931).</p>
