        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice,\nIn Davis v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 500 Pa. 84, 454 A.2d 973 (1982), we held that a party injured in an automobile accident may not recover under the uninsured motorist provision of his own insurance policy where the responsible party has maintained liability insurance in at least the minimum amount required by Pennsylvania\u2019s financial responsibility law. The question presented in this case is whether recovery should be permitted pursuant to an uninsured motorist clause where the responsible party has the statutory minimum amount of liability insurance but where the claimant recovers less than that amount because of multiple claims against the responsible party\u2019s insurance.\nIn Davis, we concluded that the plain meaning of the term \u201cuninsured\u201d forecloses the claim that a motorist who has a policy of liability insurance meeting the statutory requirements is \u201cuninsured.\u201d Here, although the responsible party was unable to pay the claimant the amount that he would have received had there been two or fewer claimants, the fact remains that, as in Davis, the responsible party had a policy of liability insurance which met statutory requirements. In light of the plain meaning of the term \u201cuninsured,\u201d we conclude that the Legislature did not intend that the \u201cuninsured\u201d status of the responsible party should vary according to whether the injured party is able to recover the statutory minimum amount. As we stated in Davis, \u201c[our] Legislature has chosen not to require insurance coverage for those instances in which a tortfeasor\u2019s insurance is insufficient to satisfy the injured party\u2019s claims. . . . [T]his Court may not enlarge the scope of the plain meaning of the Uninsured Motorist Law to circumvent the Legislature\u2019s judgment.\u201d\nOrder of the Superior Court affirmed.\nHUTCHINSON, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, J., joins.",
