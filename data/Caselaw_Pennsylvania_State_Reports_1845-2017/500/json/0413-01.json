        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn August 2, 1978, 62-year-old Willa Mae Hill was brutally stabbed to death and her apartment was ransacked. In connection with these crimes, a jury found appellant James M. Giles guilty of murder of the second degree and robbery. Following the denial of post-verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment for murder and ten to twenty years imprisonment for robbery. This direct appeal followed.\nAppellant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.\nThe test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCommonwealth v. Pitts, 486 Pa. 212, 215, 404 A.2d 1305, 1306 (1979).\nViewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record in this case reveals the following facts: The decedent, Willa Mae Hill, lived in a second floor apartment above a bar owned by appellant\u2019s family. It was her custom to come into the bar each month to pick up her food stamps and Social Security check. On the afternoon of August 2,1978, the decedent came into the bar, picked up an envelope, and left. Appellant, who lived in the third floor apartment above the bar and who worked in the bar, was in the bar when the decedent came in. Some time thereafter, appellant left the bar.\nAt about 4:20 p.m., police officer Dominic Bellizzie, responding to a radio call, found appellant lying on the sidewalk outside the apartment building. Appellant was surrounded by a group of spectators; appellant\u2019s cheek was bleeding and a broken knife was lying on the sidewalk about four feet in front of him. In response to a suggestion from an unidentified onlooker, Bellizzie proceeded into the apartment building to investigate the second floor apartment. Once inside, Bellizzie found a wig, eyeglasses and a slipper in the hallway near the entrance. In the front bedroom, Bellizzie found the decedent lying on the floor in a pool of blood. While Bellizzie was investigating, appellant came into the apartment and tried to enter the bedroom where the decedent had been found. Bellizzie restrained appellant and, with the help of another police officer who had arrived on the scene, placed appellant in a second bedroom. Bellizzie then asked appellant, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI know who did it.\u201d When Bellizzie asked, \u201cOkay, who did it?\u201d appellant responded, \u201cI did it. Go ahead and take me downtown.\u201d\nThe bedroom where the decedent was found was in disarray; the bureau drawers were pulled out, some of the drawers\u2019 contents were on the floor, and the decedent\u2019s open purse was on the floor. There were also numerous bloodstains found in both the decedent\u2019s and appellant\u2019s apartments: an envelope in the top drawer of the decedent\u2019s bureau was stained with blood; appellant\u2019s blood was found in the decedent\u2019s apartment on a light switch in the kitchen, on the refrigerator, on the bedroom wall and on a piece of newspaper; and clots of the decedent\u2019s blood were found, along with some clothes and some bloodstained water, in the bathtub of appellant\u2019s third floor apartment.\nThe medical examiner testified that the decedent\u2019s death was caused by bleeding from at least eleven stab wounds to the neck, chest, abdomen and right leg. The medical examiner further testified that there was evidence that the decedent had been sexually assaulted.\nThis evidence is sufficient to prove both robbery and murder of the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crimes Code provides that\n(1) A person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he:\n(i) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another;\n(2) An act shall be deemed \u201cin the course of committing a theft\u201d if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in flight after the attempt or commission.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3701(a) .\nThere is no question that the Commonwealth proved the element of serious bodily injury beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, we may infer from the facts of record that the decedent came into the bar and picked up her food stamps or Social Security check, and that appellant knew this. This inference, together with the disarray in the decedent\u2019s bedroom and the bloodstained envelope found in the decedent\u2019s bureau, constitutes sufficient evidence from which we may conclude that appellant stabbed the decedent in an attempt to take some of the decedent\u2019s property from her apartment.\nThe Crimes Code also provides that A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b). \u201cPerpetration of a felony\u201d is defined as\nThe act of the defendant in engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(d).\nAppellant\u2019s admission to Officer Bellizzie that \u201cI did it. Go ahead and take me downtown,\u201d along with the fact that the decedent was stabbed at least eleven times, is sufficient to prove that appellant was guilty of criminal homicide. Further, the evidence of appellant\u2019s attempt to commit a robbery is sufficient to prove that the criminal homicide of the decedent was committed by appellant in the perpetration of a felony. The evidence is thus sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of murder of the second degree.\nAppellant next contends that the trial court erred in allowing testimony concerning a sexual assault upon the decedent. The medical examiner testified that the decedent was found lying on the floor of her bedroom nude, except for a pair of socks and a blouse which was pulled up around her neck; that the tissues around the victim\u2019s vaginal and anal openings were stretched, torn and bruised; and that these injuries were most likely the result of a sexual assault. Appellant argues that since he was not charged with any sexual offense, the medical examiner\u2019s testimony only served to impermissibly inflame and prejudice the jury. This argument is without merit.\nWhere a murder is alleged to have been committed in the perpetration of a felony, there is no requirement that the defendant actually be charged with the underlying felony. See Commonwealth v. Bastone, 466 Pa. 548, 553-54, 353 A.2d 827, 830 (1976) and cases cited therein. In this case, appellant was charged with murder generally; the Commonwealth proceeded upon a theory of murder of the second degree based upon the underlying felonies of rape and robbery; and the challenged testimony of the medical examiner was relevant to prove an element of the crime with which appellant was charged, namely, the underlying felony of rape. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b), (d). Thus, even assuming that this testimony was of an inflammatory nature, its possible effect upon the jury did not outweigh its relevance in proving an element of a crime with which appellant was charged. See Commonwealth v. Green, 477 Pa. 170, 176, 383 A.2d 877, 880 (1978) (\u201cAll of the prosecution\u2019s evidence is intended to prejudice the defense. Simply because it is damaging to the defense is no reason to exclude the evidence. ... Prejudicial evidence is inadmissible only if it violates rules concerning the admission of evidence.\u201d).\nFinally, appellant contends that the Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence from him, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\nThe evidence which appellant sought to obtain was a \u201cpolice 48.\u201d According to Officer Bellizzie, the \u201cpolice 48\u201d is a small form which gives brief details of the date, time and location of an incident, the name of the officer at the scene of the incident, and the name of the complainant. Although Bellizzie admitted that he had completed a \u201cpolice 48\u201d in this case, he stated that he had turned the form over to the police operation\u2019s room supervisor; that he had no idea what happened to the form thereafter; and that he had attempted to get a copy, but that no such copy was available.\nIn Brady, the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\nId. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-1197.\nIn this case, there is no evidence that the prosecutor suppressed the \u201cpolice 48\u201d which appellant sought to obtain. In fact, testimony from appellant\u2019s suppression hearing reveals that police officials mistakenly threw away the \u201c48\u201d filed by Bellizzie so that the prosecutor never even had an opportunity to see it, much less to suppress it.\nFurther, it is difficult to imagine, and appellant does not suggest, how the names and dates on the \u201cpolice 48\u201d would be either favorable to him or material to the issues of his guilt or punishment. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no violation of Brady in this case.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed..\n. The Crimes Code provides that\nA person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921(a).\n. The fact that there is no evidence that appellant actually took any of the decedent\u2019s property is irrelevant, since a person may be guilty of robbery even if he only attempts to commit theft. See 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 3701(a)(1), (a)(2).\n. The Crimes Code provides that\nA person is guilty of criminal homicide if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2501(a).\n. After the Commonwealth rested, the trial judge reserved judgment on appellant\u2019s request that the jury not be instructed on the availability of rape as an underlying felony to support a conviction for murder of the second degree. In response, the Commonwealth withdrew its request to have the jury charged on the crime of rape as an underlying felony. Nevertheless, when the Commonwealth introduced the medical examiner\u2019s testimony at the beginning of its case, that testimony was still relevant to prove an element of the crime charged.\n. Appellant also contends 1) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on murder of the second degree because there was no evidence to support such a charge, 2) that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence photographs of blood-stained clothing in appellant\u2019s bathtub, 3) that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence an inculpatory statement made by appellant at the scene of the murder, and 4) that the felony of attempted robbery could not form the basis for his conviction since he was never charged with attempted robbery. These issues have been waived, however, because they were not included in appellant\u2019s post-verdict motions. See Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975); Commonwealth v. Gravely, 486 Pa. 194, 404 A.2d 1296 (1979).",
