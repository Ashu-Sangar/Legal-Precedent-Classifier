        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAt issue on this appeal is whether the health care facilities of appellant West Allegheny Hospital, a non-profit corporation founded in 1956, are exempt from real estate taxes imposed by appellee West Allegheny School District. Two facilities are involved, one of which was acquired by appellant in late 1964 and was in operation until 1973, the other of which was built by appellant in 1973 and has been in operation since.\nThe Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County denied both of appellant\u2019s applications for an exemption. After evidentiary hearings, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered orders sustaining both of appellant\u2019s appeals from the adverse rulings of the Board. A divided panel of the Commonwealth Court entered an order reversing the orders of the court of common pleas. This Court granted allowance of appeal.\nAfter a review of our case law interpreting the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, we conclude that the present record establishes appellant\u2019s entitlement to an exemption with respect to both health care facilities. Hence, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the orders of the court of common pleas. 63 Pa.Cmwlth. 555, 439 A.2d 1293.\nThe basis for appellant\u2019s claims of exemption is section 204(a)(3) of the General County Assessment Law, Act of May 22,1933, P.L. 853, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-204(a)(3) (Supp.1982), a statute enacted by the Legislature pursuant to its constitutional authority to confer tax-exempt status on \u201cinstitutions of purely public charity,\u201d Pa. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 2. Section 204(a)(3) confers an exemption on \u201c[a]ll hospitais, universities, colleges, seminaries, academies, associations and institutions of learning, benevolence, or charity, including fire and rescue stations, with the grounds thereto annexed and necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the same, founded, endowed, and maintained by public or private charity . .. . \u201d These requirements are subject to the following: \u201cProvided, That the entire revenue derived by the same be applied to the support and to increase the efficiency and facilities thereof, the repair and the necessary increase of grounds and buildings thereof, and for no other purpose.\u201d\nIt is clear that appellant\u2019s facilities are \u201cpurely public\u201d within the meaning of Pa. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 2. \u201c[T]he word \u2018purely\u2019 is prefixed by the constitution ... to intensify the word \u2018public,\u2019 not \u2018charity.\u2019 It must be purely public; that is, there must be no admixture of any qualification for admission, heterogeneous, and not solely relating to the public.\u201d City of Philadelphia v. Masonic Home of Pennsylvania, 160 Pa. 572, 578-79, 28 A. 954, 955 (1894). By-laws of the corporation provide that \u201cno distinction shall be made in the admission or treatment of patients in regard to race, color, creed, national origin or sex,\u201d a policy which has been adhered to in practice. Compare City of Philadelphia v. Masonic Home of Pennsylvania, supra (home for aged men restricting eligibility to Freemasons not \u201cpurely public\u201d). Since its inception, appellant has maintained an \u201copen-admission policy,\u201d pursuant to which appellant has provided comprehensive health care without regard to a patient\u2019s ability to pay.\nIt is also clear that each of appellant\u2019s facilities is a \u201chospital,\u201d an institution specifically deemed eligible by the Legislature for tax-exempt status, with a recognized charitable purpose \u2014 the promotion of health. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 372 (1959). So, too, there is no question that appellant was charitably founded, as a non-profit corporation devoted to the \u201cdelivery of comprehensive health care\u201d to the West Allegheny community.\nWhat is disputed is whether appellant has been \u201cendowed and maintained by public or private charity.\u201d It is apparent on the present record that, although appellant has been the object of considerable generosity, both public and private, both quantifiable and not, this generosity has not been sufficient to offset the cost of capital acquisition. Approximately $565,000 of the $590,000 total cost of the first facility and $3 million of the $4.3 million total cost of the second facility were financed by appellant. Similarly, cash donations have covered only a small portion of appellant\u2019s day-to-day operating expenses, which include the costs of administrative and professional salaries, supplies, and utilities. Thus, both the cost of capital acquisitions and the cost of day-to-day operating expenses which have not been covered by donations have been passed along to patients, who have paid approximately 80% of the amounts billed. This high percentage of payment is attributable both to health care insurance carried by patients and the efforts of a debt-collection agency employed by appellant.\nIn denying appellant\u2019s exemption claims, the Commonwealth Court held that appellant\u2019s patient billings have placed a disproportionate burden of appellant\u2019s operational costs on patients. This holding, however, fails to consider the proviso to section 204(a)(3), which authorizes specific applications of \u201crevenue\u201d \u2014 a term which includes funds earned by the rendering of services. Such funds may be applied not only to \u201csupport\u201d the institution but also \u201cto increase the efficiency and facilities thereofthe repair and necessary increase of grounds and buildings thereof ...\u201d (emphasis added). This legislative definition of the scope of permissible applications of revenues \u2014 here, funds derived from patient billings \u2014 recognizes that the support and repair of the institution need not be funded solely by charity, and that necessary capital acquisitions need not be financed completely through charitable endowments.\nThe record is clear that appellant has satisfied these terms of the statutory proviso. Revenues from patient billings have been properly applied to the day-to-day operating expenses of appellant\u2019s institutions, including the expenses of support and repair. The revenues also have been properly applied to the costs of financing the acquisition of facilities necessary to the fulfillment of the institution\u2019s charitable purpose.\nFinally, the revenues from patient billings have, in the words of the proviso, been used by appellant \u201cfor no other purpose\u201d than to contribute to \u201cthe support [of the institution] and the increase of the efficiency and facilities thereof, the repair and the necessary increase of grounds and buildings thereof.\u201d Although appellant was founded in part by two doctors who have been compensated by appellant for their work in various administrative capacities, the record establishes that the doctors\u2019 work has been necessary to the functioning of appellant\u2019s facilities and has been paid for at rates equal to or less than the rates paid by comparable institutions for comparable services. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra, \u00a7 376 Comment b. The same founding doctors were the principal shareholders of the corporation which had owned the facility in 1964, immediately preceding its acquisition. However, the record reveals that the acquisition price of $590,000 was reasonable, being $43,000 less than the lower of two appraisals which had been considered by the board of trustees.\nOur reading of the proviso to section 204(a)(3) of the General County Assessment Law is supported by Presbyterian Homes Tax Exemption Case, 428 Pa. 145, 236 A.2d 776 (1968), a case interpreting provisions of The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law which are comparable to the provisions of section 204(a)(3). See Act of May 21, 1943, P.L. 571, \u00a7 202(a)(3), 72 P.S. \u00a7 5453.202(a)(3) (1968). There it was held that a residence for elderly citizens was entitled to an exemption as a charity even though \u201cmany residents [paid] their way completely and 80 per cent of the operational costs [were] paid by the residents .... \u201d 428 Pa. at 153, 236 A.2d at 780. See Episcopal Academy v. City of Philadelphia, 150 Pa. 565, 25 A. 55 (1892); Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra, \u00a7 376 Comment c.\nAppellee, however, relies upon language in our early case law which would suggest that the costs of necessary capital acquisition are not appropriately passed along to the beneficiaries of an institution. For example, in Y.M.C.A. of Germantown v. City of Philadelphia, 323 Pa. 401, 187 A. 204 (1936), this Court quoted a dictionary\u2019s definition of \u201ccharity\u201d to support its conclusion that \u201cwhatever [a charitable institution] does for others is done free of charge, or at least so nearly free of charge as to make the charges nominal or negligible . . . . \u201d 323 Pa. at 411-12, 187 A. at 209. Notwithstanding this language, our reading of the proviso to section 204(a)(3) convinces us that the word \u201ccharity\u201d as used by the Legislature does not contemplate the requirement that there be only a nominal charge to beneficiaries. Such a requirement clearly conflicts with the evident intent of the proviso to accommodate evolving institutional needs in the light of limits to public and private generosity. Accordingly, the language in Germantown Y.M.C.A. must be disapproved.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County are reinstated.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which HUTCHINSON, J., joins.\n. Pa. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 2 provides:\n\u201cThe General Assembly may by law exempt from taxation ... [\u00a1Institutions of purely public charity, but in the case of any real property tax exemptions only that portion of real property of such institution which is actually and regularly used for the purposes of the institution.\u201d\n. As was summarized by one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, West Allegheny is a \u201ctypical community hospital.\u201d Appellant\u2019s services include emergency, out-patient, and in-patient acute medical care. Appellant is a member of the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, the Southern Allegheny County Hospital Association, and the American Osteopathic Hospital Association, and has been accredited by the Joint Council on Hospital Accreditation.\n. The major portion of appellant\u2019s billings have been scrutinized by third-party payors for excessive costs. See generally Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia v. Pustilnik, 497 Pa. 221, 439 A.2d 1149 (1981).\n. Any other reading of the proviso would yield unreasonable results. As this record indicates, construction costs for a facility frequently involve several millions of dollars, and \u201cprime\u201d real estate must often be acquired if the facility is to be able to fulfill the institution\u2019s charitable purpose. One would have to be removed from modern-day realities to believe that such costs are easily subsidized, even in part; and yet if such costs were not the proper subject of the application of funds derived from beneficiaries of the institution, the language \u201cendowed ... by public or private charity,\u201d if not qualified by the proviso, would require subsidization in full.\n. Appellee School District advances several arguments which are secondary to the primary issue of whether appellant is entitled to an exemption, none of which warrants extended discussion. With respect to the claim that appellant failed to lay a proper foundation for the testimony of a witness who had prepared summaries of appellant\u2019s financial data, the record is clear that that witness supplied no evidence in support of facts material to a resolution of the present dispute which had not already been acknowledged by appellee. As to appellee\u2019s claims relating to the timeliness of appellant\u2019s exemption applications filed with the Board of Property Assessment and appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration of the initial denial of an exemption for the facility acquired in 1964, the court of common pleas correctly held that appellee has failed to establish the claims. We also agree with the court of common pleas that, contrary to appellee\u2019s contention, appellant has established that those properties which the court deemed to be tax-exempt have been used for charitable purposes.",

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority appears to have centered its analysis upon the fact that appellant is a hospital and concludes that because a hospital promotes health, if it is public, it should be tax exempt. However, our case law has established a three-pronged test to be applied when a claim is made for real estate tax exemption under the Pa. Const., art. VIII, \u00a7 2 and 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-204(a)(3) (Supp.1981-82). The test is set forth in Woods School Tax Exemption Case, 406 Pa. 579, 584, 178 A.2d 600, 602 (1962):\n[T]o obtain the claimed exemption from taxation, [appellant] must affirmatively show that the entire institution, (1) is one of \u201cpurely public charity\u201d; (2) was founded by public or private charity; (3) is maintained by public or private charity. [Emphasis added.]\nAccord, Four Freedoms House of Phila., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 443 Pa. 215, 279 A.2d 155 (1971); Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics Tax Exemption Case, 435 Pa. 618, 258 A.2d 850 (1969).\nMoreover, in Four Freedoms House of Phila., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, supra, a review of the pertinent law for such cases revealed:\nSince liability of all real estate is the rule with exemption the exception, e.g., Dougherty v. City of Philadelphia, 112 Pa.Superior Ct. 570, 172 Atl. 177 (1934), the burden is placed on the claimant to bring itself within the exemption. E.g., Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics Tax Exemption Case, 435 Pa. 618, 258 A.2d 850 (1969); University of Pittsburgh Tax Exemption Case, 407 Pa. 416, 180 A.2d 760 (1962); Wynnefield United Presbyterian Church v. City of Philadelphia, 348 Pa. 252, 35 A.2d 276 (1944); Albright College Tax Assessment Case, 213 Pa.Superior Ct. 478, 249 A.2d 833 (1968). Moreover, statutory provisions exempting property from taxation are subject to a strict construction. E.g., Y.M.C.A. v. Reading, 402 Pa. 592, 167 A.2d 469 (1961); McGuire v. Pittsburgh School District, 359 Pa. 602, 60 A.2d 44 (1948).\n433 Pa. at 218, 379 A.2d at 157.\nTurning to the case at bar, appellant\u2019s \u201copen-admission policy\u201d coupled with adherence to its by-laws\u2019 prohibition against discrimination or a distinction in the admission of patients based upon race, color, creed, national origin or sex, may satisfy the public part of the first prong of the test.\nYet, the second and third prongs also must be met. The majority rather summarily dispenses with the requirement of having been founded by a public or private charity by noting the institution has a purpose, the promotion of health, which has been accepted as a charitable purpose in regards to an inter vivos or testamentary trust. This simply will not suffice. The key question in the second prong of the three-pronged test is not whether the institution\u2019s activities comply with a definition of charitable purpose but, rather, was the institution begun or founded by gift, either public or private. The fact that appellant corporation is \u201cnon-profit\u201d is not decisive of this issue. See, Metropolitan Pittsburgh Nonprofit Housing Corporation v. Bd. of Property Assessment, 480 Pa. 622, 391 A.2d 1059 (1978).\nAn objective examination of the record reveals that the original property purchased by Drs. Roberts and Grilli in 1956 for a very low price, less than $40,000.00, was deeded to the Tioga Corporation (which is not asserted to have been non-profit and whose principal shareholders were Drs. Roberts and Grilli). A parcel of the original property was sold to the appellant West Allegheny Hospital, (a non-profit corporation whose incorporators were Drs. Roberts, Grilli, Shelhorse, Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Grilli) for a purchase price of $590,000.00 after having charged and received rent from West Allegheny Hospital for at least nine years. In addition to the huge profit in this transfer, it is also significant that appellant corporation\u2019s first capital acquisition accrued nine years after its incorporation. The record does not support a conclusion that the founding of West Allegheny Hospital was by gift. Such a conclusion is necessary to give this prong of the test any meaning. Therefore, the second prong of the test has not been met.\nFinally, the third prong of the test has not been met either. Patients have paid or caused to be paid approximately 97% of the amounts billed for in-patient care and 80% of the amounts billed for out-patient care. In addition to payments from third-party payors, appellant has received huge federal sums and employs a collection agency for outstanding patient accounts. The majority\u2019s use of the word \u201crevenue\u201d in the proviso to section 204(a)(3) in order to overcome the blatant fact that Drs. Roberts and Grilli have passed the substantial operating costs and capital acquisition costs on to patients and/or the public without any significant accompanying gifts at founding or for maintenance is not in accord with the required strict construction of the statute involved nor the constitutional concept of a \u201cpurely public charity.\u201d\nIt was stated in Hill School Tax Exemption Case, 370 Pa. 21, 23, 87 A.2d 259, 261 (1952). \u201cIt requires no citation of authority to demonstrate that a private hospital founded and maintained by a group of doctors for their own convenience, with or without profit, would not qualify for such tax exemption.\u201d It requires no citation of authority to show that a non-profit corporation serving the public as a hospital but (1) founded by several doctors and their wives, without identifiable or quantifiable gift, (2) paid rent to a private corporation owned by two of the same doctors for nine years, (3) delivered a capital gain of over $550,000.00 to that private corporation owned by two of the same doctors, (4) received approximately $1,500,000 in federal money for capital improvements, (5) whose patients cover the major portion of appellant\u2019s operating expenses by paying approximately 97% or 80% of the amount billed through hospital third-party coverage or a collection agency, (6) whose physicians pay a \u201cbed-tax\u201d to the hospital and (7) receives payments from this Commonwealth for treatment of those on welfare, does not qualify for the tax exemption.\nPassing a substantial part of operating costs on to appellant\u2019s health care consumers is one thing. Passing an additional part of appellant\u2019s costs on to the public by way of a constitutional real estate tax exemption under these facts is quite another. I would affirm the Commonwealth Court.\nHUTCHINSON, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. We note that the first prong also requires a pure charity element which is not satisfied merely by the dispensing of medical service.\n. After a careful review of the record, I find no evidence of founding monetary gifts. At inception, there were loans made to West Allegheny Hospital. The loans were repaid with interest.",
