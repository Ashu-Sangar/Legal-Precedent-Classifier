        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMcDERMOTT, Justice:\nThis is a claim for the contents of a decedent\u2019s safe deposit box. Appellant contends a gift inter vivos.\nWe have often stated that a gift among the living must be intentionally made by a delivery of the subject matter of the gift to the donee by the donor; a delivery, actual or constructive, that puts the subject matter beyond the control of the donor.\nOne who claims a gift inter vivos must, before he may himself testify to the donative intent, establish a prima facie case that the subject matter was delivered to him beyond the power of recall by the donor.\nWe have several times dealt with the contents of a safe deposit box and have set down rules directly applicable to the case at bar:\nTo constitute a valid gift inter vivos of the contents of a safe deposit box, two essential elements are requisite: An intention to make an immediate gift, and such an actual or constructive delivery to the donee (a) as to divest the donor of all dominion and control, or (b) if a joint tenancy is created, as to invest in the donee so much dominion and control of the subject matter of the gift as is consonant with a joint ownership or interest therein.\nIn Re Secary\u2019s Estate, 407 Pa. 162, 166, 180 A.2d 572, 574 (1962). We have said these elements may only be established by evidence which is clear, direct, precise, and convincing. In Re Chiarra\u2019s Estate, 467 Pa. 586, 359 A.2d 756 (1976), affirmed 478 Pa. 630, 387 A.2d 666 (1978). The trial court found, and we agree, that the appellant\u2019s evidence failed to meet these standards.\nThe court found that appellant had not established prima facie the existence of a gift and therefore, his own testimony was incompetent under the \u201cDead Man\u2019s Act\u201d. The court found further that even were it to consider all the testimony placed on record, including that of appellant, the necessary elements had not been established.\nThe two witnesses offered by claimant to establish the prima facie case failed of their mission when their testimony proved that, whatever intentions might have existed in the mind of the decedent, one was that the money was to be available if needed by the decedent.\nDecedent had the right to use the funds during his lifetime. Hence, the dominion and control that must be relinquished by the donor was qualified by its availability for decedent\u2019s needs. Legal ownership of the safe deposit box was in decedent. That claimant was the only one who ever used the box does not argue that its contents were his or kept for reasons other than those produced by his own evidence. Appellant failed to carry the high burden. of proving an inter vivos gift.\nThe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is hereby affirmed, with each party to pay its own costs.\nROBERTS, C.J., concurs in the result.\n. In Re Donsavage Estate, 420 Pa. 587, 218 A.2d 112 (1966).\n. Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, No. 89 \u00a7 5(e), 28 P.S. \u00a7 322 (Repealed); 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5930.\n. Claimant offered the testimony of two witnesses, Mr. Charles Johnson and his wife Shirley, each of whom were employed at the complex in which decedent resided. Mrs. Johnson, who performed weekly housekeeping chores for the decedent, testified as follows:\nQ. Now directing your attention to the period at or about the end of the year 1977. Can you tell us whether or not you had any conversations with Carl concerning Mr. Marrone?\nA. Yes, we did.\nQ. And you say we, by we who do you mean?\nA. It was in December 30 of 1977, Carl had asked Charlie and I, my husband, if we would stop in after work and have a New Year\u2019s drink with him before we went home because he would not see us on the weekend. So we said sure. So we stopped in and Carl and Charlie and I were talking. We were talking about different things and then Carl brought up about the money that he had given Gene and he said it was the amount of $5,000.00 and that it was in the safety deposit box and that Gene had a key to the box and that the money there, you know, would be used by Carl if he needed it.\nNotes of Testimony, November 13, 1979, at 5-6.\nThe testimony of Mr. Johnson, maintenance supervisor at the residence, was to similar effect:\nQ. What, if anything, did you hear him say regarding the money for Mr. Marrone?\nA. I heard Carl say that he gave Gene $5,000.00 in an envelope and Gene took it and put it in a safe deposit box, which Carl could use it if he needed it.\nNotes of Testimony, November 13, 1979 at 11.",
