        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nOn July 4,1978 appellee, Zoe Ann Breitegan, was involved in a motor vehicle accident, as a result of which the driver of another vehicle involved was killed. Three traffic citations were issued under the Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 101, et seq., and Ms. Breitegan was charged with the misdemeanors of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3731, homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3732, and involuntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504.\nAppellee filed a motion in the Court of Common Pleas to quash the information for the misdemeanors on the grounds of her plea to the three summary offenses. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the motion to quash. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the Court of Common Pleas and quashed the information on the basis of our compulsory joinder rule and Section 110 of the Crimes Code. 18 C.P. S.A. \u00a7 110.\nWe have held in Commonwealth v. Beatty, 500 Pa. 284, 455 A.2d 1194 (1983) that the compulsory joinder rule and Section 110 do not apply to prior summary convictions for traffic violations under the Motor Vehicle Code. Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is reversed and the Order of the Court of Common Pleas is reinstated.\nFormer Chief Justice O\u2019Brien did not participate in the decision of this case.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result. See Commonwealth v. Beatty, 500 Pa. 284, 293, 455 A.2d 1194, 1199, LARSEN, J. concurring (1983).\nFLAHERTY, J., concurs in the result.\n. Driving too fast for conditions, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361; Reckless driving, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3714; and Driving to the left of center, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301.\n. Under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6502(b) the penalty for the instant summary offenses was Twenty-five ($25.00) Dollars.",
