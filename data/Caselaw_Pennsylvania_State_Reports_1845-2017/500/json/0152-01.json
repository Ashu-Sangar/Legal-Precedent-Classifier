        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis is an appeal by appellant, Schuylkill County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Program, from a Superior Court order reversing the decision of the Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas, by which appellee, Donna Hutchinson, was involuntarily committed to Wernersville State Hospital for a period of ninety days for psychiatric treatment under Section 304 of the Mental Health Procedures Act (hereinafter \u201cMHPA\u201d).\nThe facts revealed by the record are as follows. Appellee\u2019s grandmother petitioned under Section 304 of the MHPA for an emergency examination of appellee on May 19, 1979, claiming that appellee had physically abused and threatened her. On May 21, 1979, an examining physician petitioned the court to commit appellee involuntarily for a period not to exceed ninety days pursuant to the MHPA. The following day a hearing was conducted, at which the examining psychiatrist and appellee appeared as witnesses.\nAt the hearing, the psychiatrist testified that the May 19, 1979, emergency commitment forms indicated that within the last thirty days appellee had struck her grandmother and that she had possessed a gun with which she had threatened to kill someone. Although the police had taken the gun from her, appellee had continued her threats, according to the psychiatrist.\nThe psychiatrist further testified as to appellee\u2019s prior history of psychiatric treatment and his personal examination of her during the emergency commitment. He concluded that appellee was suffering from a severe mental disability and without treatment she was a serious threat to the people of the community. In addition to relying on the commitment forms in his testimony the psychiatrist testified to the content of conversations he had had with appellee\u2019s grandmother and with several of appellee\u2019s other relatives. Appellee\u2019s counsel made no objection to these obvious hearsay statements.\nAppellee took the stand and denied threatening or striking her grandmother and possessing a gun during the thirty-day period prior the proceedings below. She testified that her relatives were hostile toward her and admitted that she was not taking the medication prescribed by her physician. At the close of the hearing, the trial court ordered appellees to receive in-patient treatment at the state hospital for a period not to exceed ninety days.\nAppellee obtained the services of different counsel and appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the lower court\u2019s order, holding that appellee had not received effective assistance of counsel. In re Commitment of Donna Hutchinson, 279 Pa.Super. 401, 421 A.2d 261 (1980). We granted allocatur and now affirm.\nThe instant case again requires us to consider the MHPA, which, we have observed, is \u201can enlightened legislative endeavor to strike a balance between the state\u2019s valid interest in imposing and providing mental health treatment and the individual patient\u2019s rights.\u201d In re Gross, 476 Pa. 203, 212, 382 A.2d 116, 121 (1978). It is well-settled that involuntary civil commitment of mentally ill persons constitutes deprivation of liberty and may be accomplished only in accordance with due process protections. Appeal of Niccoli, 472 Pa. 389, 395 n. 4, 372 A.2d 749, 752 n. 4 (1977); Commonwealth v. McQuaid, 464 Pa. 499, 517, 347 A.2d 465, 475 (1975); Commonwealth ex rel. Finken v. Roop, 234 Pa.Super. 155, 163, 339 A.2d 764, 768 (1975), appeal dismissed, 424 U.S. 960, 96 S.Ct. 1452, 47 L.Ed.2d 728 (1976). See also, Adding-ton v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979). As the General Assembly stated in enacting the MHPA:\nIt is the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to seek to assure the availability of adequate treatment to persons who are mentally ill, and it is the purpose of this act to establish procedures whereby this policy can be effected. The provisions of this act shall be interpreted in conformity with the principles of due process to make voluntary and involuntary treatment available where the need is great and its absence could result in serious harm to the mentally ill person or to others.\n50 P.S. \u00a7 7102 (emphasis supplied).\nWe are now called upon to decide whether the vindication of the due process rights of an alleged mental incompetent require that such a person receive effective representation of counsel at civil commitment proceedings. Resolution of this question requires us to balance the competing interests of the Commonwealth and of the individual in the civil commitment context.\nThe Commonwealth has dual interests in civil commitment proceedings. First, the state must assure availability of adequate treatment to those persons who are mentally ill, but who, for whatever reasons, decline treatment. See 50 P.S. \u00a7 7102. The Commonwealth\u2019s right to impinge upon the freedom of a mentally ill person for his or her own benefit is based on the doctrine of parens patriae, i.e., that the state has a solemn duty to safeguard the welfare of the individual. Secondly, the Commonwealth is obliged to protect the welfare of others from the mentally ill person. The authority to confine dangerous persons arises from the state\u2019s inherent police powers. See generally, Developments \u2014 Civil Commitment of the Mentally 111, 87 Harv.L. Rev. 1190 (1974).\nThe individual interests in such proceedings are self-evident: to obtain treatment where necessary, but always to preserve individual liberty. To protect these interests the legislature has provided that an alleged mental incompetent is entitled to representation by private or court-appointed counsel. 50 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7304(c)(3), 7304(e)(1).\nFor the legislatively-created right to representation to have meaning, counsel must be effective. Indeed, without the guiding hand of competent counsel, appellee\u2019s right to representation would be rendered worthless. Moreover, appellee would be unable to enjoy the other protections guaranteed by Section 304 of the MHPA, such as the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses and the right to a public hearing on the record.\nWe therefore hold that an alleged mental incompetent is entitled to effective representation by competent counsel, and that such a person may raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in attacking a commitment order. Upon review of a challenge to counsel\u2019s effectiveness, the courts must examine the record of the proceedings to ascertain whether counsel\u2019s actions had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. See Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-05, 235 A.2d 349, 352-53 (1967). Where no such basis appears in the record, counsel shall be deemed ineffective, and a new hearing, at which the alleged mental incompetent may be represented by competent counsel, must be held.\nApplying this standard to the instant case, we agree with the Superior Court that appellee\u2019s counsel was ineffective. Appellee\u2019s counsel failed to object when the Commonwealth\u2019s only witness, the examining psychiatrist, testified that the commitment forms and a-telephone conversation with appellee\u2019s grandmother revealed that appellee had assaulted her grandmother and had possessed a gun which was taken from her by the police. This testimony was clearly hearsay because it represented out of court statements made by appellee\u2019s grandmother, which were offered to prove that appellee did indeed commit the alleged assault. Neither the police nor the grandmother were called as witnesses. Without doubt, this evidence was crucial in establishing whether appellant presented a clear and present danger to others under Section 301(b)(1) of MHPA. Under these circumstances, appellee\u2019s counsel at the commitment hearing could have had no reasonable basis for failing to object to this evidence. See Commonwealth v. Witherspoon, 481 Pa. 321, 392 A.2d 1313 (1978). Because counsel was ineffective, a new hearing is required.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nHUTCHINSON, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 817, No. 143, \u00a7 304, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304.\n. A court may order involuntary treatment under 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304, if it determines that a person is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment. An individual is considered severely mentally disabled when he or she poses a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself or herself. 50 P.S. 7301(a). To establish dangerousness to others, it must be shown that within the past thirty days the person has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another and that there is reason to believe that such conduct will be repeated. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7301(b)(1).\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. 724.\n. The Legislature has mandated extensive procedural protections for the individual in civil commitment proceedings. See generally, 50 P.S. 7304.\n. As the Superior Court noted, other jurisdictions have insisted that counsel at a civil commitment hearing must be effective. E.g., Lynch v. Baxley, 386 F.Supp. 378 (M.D.Ala. 1974): Suzuki v. Quisenberry, 411 F.Supp. 1113 (D.Hawaii 1976); State ex rel. Hawks v. Lazaro, 157 W.Va. 417, 202 S.E.2d 109 (1974); State ex rel. Memmel v. Mundy, 75 Wis.2d 276, 249 N.W.2d 573 (1977).\n. We are constrained to note that, while the standard we announce today for effective assistance in commitment proceedings is the same as that for criminal proceedings, the rights to effective assistance are not precisely co-extensive in the criminal and civil commitment realms. The right to effective assistance in commitment proceedings must be viewed in the civil commitment context in light of the purposes of the MHPA as set forth in Section 102, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7102.\n. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7301.\n. We find without merit appellant\u2019s claim that hearsay evidence is admissible in all proceedings under MHPA on the theory that hearsay is admissible at the informal hearing required for an application for extended emergency treatment not to exceed 20 days. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(c). Appellee was committed for a period not to exceed 90 days pursuant to \u00a7 304, which requires a formal hearing to be held in accordance with due process standards. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304. The legislature has determined that commitments for less than twenty days do not require the same formalities as are necessary in commitments for longer periods of time. This case does not require us to decide the propriety of the relaxed standards under \u00a7 303.\nFurthermore, appellant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses necessarily implies that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304(e)(3). Finally, considering the grave consequences of an adjudication of mental illness under \u00a7 304, it is imperative that the commitment court strictly comply with the rules of evidence generally applicable to other proceedings which may result in an extended deprivation of an individual\u2019s liberty. The Commonwealth\u2019s burden to present admissible evidence at the commitment hearings is small compared to the individual\u2019s interest in not being deprived of liberty on the basis of inherently unreliable evidence. See Commonwealth ex rel. Finken v. Roop, 234 Pa.Super. at 173-74, 339 A.2d at 773-74.",

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI am in agreement that the right of counsel, conferred under the Mental Health Procedures Act, carries with it the concomitant requirement that counsel\u2019s performance must be effective on behalf of the client. However, in view of the nature of the inquiry, it must be remembered that the best interest of the client in these cases is not necessarily served by striving to seek the client\u2019s release. The mere fact that counsel failed to object to the hearsay evidence in this case without a further explanation as to why counsel elected to follow that course of action does not provide a justification for a finding of ineffectiveness.\nFor example, counsel from his own investigation may well have been aware of the existence of the facts supportive of the conclusion that his client was a danger to herself and others. If such was the case, I do not believe that the attorney was under a duty to take advantage of some fortuitous difficulty with which the government may have been faced in presenting legally admissible evidence of these facts.\nAccordingly, I would have directed at the very least that a hearing be held to ascertain counsel\u2019s explanation for his decision.\n.
