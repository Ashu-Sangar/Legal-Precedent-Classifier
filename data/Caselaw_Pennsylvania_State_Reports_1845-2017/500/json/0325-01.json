Section 9(C) provides:\nThis section, without reference to any other law, shall be deemed complete for the acquisition, by agreement, of projects, as defined in this act. . . any provisions of other laws to the contrary notwithstanding, and no proceedings or other action shall be required except as herein prescribed.\nThat language and its legislative history show a plain legislative intent to deprive the Public Utilities Commission of jurisdiction over the transfer of utility facilities to a municipal authority. That decision may be unwise. However, in the absence of a constitutional problem, it is within the province of the legislature and not our power to ignore it.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
