        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nAppellant James J. Fairell was convicted at a non-jury trial of murder of the first degree and related weapons offenses. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt specific intent to commit murder, appellant having placed in issue his capacity to form such specific intent due to the use of narcotics.\nAppellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree, guilty of possession of an instrument of crime generally, guilty of possession of an instrument of crime, i. e., a weapon, and not guilty of possessing a prohibited offensive weapon on October 6, 1975. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the charge of murder and to two and one-half to five years on each of the weapons charges, sentences to run concurrently. These appeals followed.\nA summary of the facts of the case are as follows: On April 27, 1975, at or about 1:00 o\u2019clock p.m., appellant entered the home of his wife\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Quartman, and, after a brief, threatening verbal exchange with those present, shot and killed his estranged wife Francine Quartman Fairell in the presence of her parents and other eyewitnesses. The cause of death was attributed to gunshot wounds of the head, right arm and back of thorax.\nAppellant\u2019s defense at trial was that he was intoxicated by narcotics to the extent that at the time of the incident he was unable to form a specific intent to commit murder. This defense was put forward through the testimony of appellant\u2019s half-brother, John Nelson, and that of Dr. Albert M. Levitt, a psychologist. Dr. Levitt testified without objection that appellant had told him of appellant\u2019s use of drugs the day of the shooting and on other occasions. Dr. Levitt also gave opinion testimony as to appellant\u2019s psychological make-up and the possible effect on appellant of the use of such drugs.\nJohn Nelson testified that a few hours before the shooting he saw appellant in possession of a number of glassine envelopes containing a white powder and that Fairell appeared \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cnot normal\u201d to him.\nRelying upon the well-settled proposition that the presumption of an accused\u2019s innocence in a criminal prosecution places upon the Commonwealth an unshifting burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, Commonwealth v. Rose, 457 Pa. 380, 321 A.2d 880 (1974) (hereinafter Rose I); Commonwealth v. Bonomo, 396 Pa. 222, 229, 151 A.2d 441 (1959); In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), appellant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of an essential element of murder of the first degree, the specific intent to kill. The presence of such specific intent is, of course, a distinguishing feature of murder of the first degree under the Crimes Code as well as at common law. Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 235, 352 A.2d 30, 35 (1976); Commonwealth v. Bricker, 458 Pa. 367, 371, 326 A.2d 279, 281 (1974); Commonwealth v. Mosley, 444 Pa. 134, 139, 279 A.2d 174, 177 (1971); Commonwealth v. Ewing, 439 Pa. 88, 91, 264 A.2d 661, 667 (1970).\nThe Commonwealth responds to this argument with the assertion that the evidence as to appellant\u2019s intoxication, or drugged state, is at best equivocal, and that the total evidence adduced at trial, when coupled with the permissible inference of specific intent to kill from appellant\u2019s intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body, is sufficient to sustain a conviction of murder of the first degree. Appellant counters with the argument, somewhat unclearly phrased, that once his capacity to form specific intent is in issue the Commonwealth may not rely alone upon the inference arising out of intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part.\nWhile the deadly weapon inference, in the absence of other evidence relevant to intent, has been held sufficient standing alone to sustain a finding of murder of the first degree, Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, supra; Commonwealth v. White, 442 Pa. 461, 463, 275 A.2d 75, 76 (1971); accord, Commonwealth v. Ewing, supra, we do not find it necessary to rely on this ground for disposition of the instant case. Our review of the record satisfies us that there was other evidence, discussed below, sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s capacity to form a specific intent.\nEvidence which is sufficient to place in issue capacity to form a specific intent due to intoxication may come from any source and at any stage of the trial, including the case-in-chief of the defense or prosecution, or the cross-examination of any witness. Rose I, supra; Commonwealth v. Haywood, 464 Pa. 226, 346 A.2d 298 (1975). The defendant need not raise the issue of his intoxication through a deliberate and formal offering of evidence on that subject.\nEvidence of intoxication, if believed, may operate to negate the intent necessary for conviction of murder in the first degree. Crimes Code, \u00a7 308, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, effective June 6, 1973. Such evidence is submitted for the consideration of the fact finder. We have held that intoxication evidence\n\u201c[C]reates no new presumption for the defendant and imposes no new burden on the Commonwealth. .\nIn Rose we stated:\n\u2018[The burden to prove the specific intent to kill] is neither increased nor diminished by an attempt by a defendant to disprove the element of intent by a showing of lack of capacity, due to intoxication, to form such an intent. Whether the Commonwealth will, in a particular case, elect to carry that burden without introducing evidence to negate the existence of a disabling condition of intoxication, . . . will be for it to decide; as in every case, the risk of nonpersuasion remains with the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 268, 344 A.2d 824, 826 (1975) (hereinafter Rose II) quoting Rose I, supra, 457 Pa. at 389, 321 A.2d at 884.\nThe Commonwealth may offer any relevant evidentiary response to defense evidence that it chooses, or none whatsoever. It is under no obligation to counter appellant\u2019s expert testimony with that of its own, but may rely on lay testimony and the testimony as to surrounding circumstances to prove its case. Commonwealth v. Zlatovich, 440 Pa. 388, 393, 269 A.2d 469, 473 (1970); Commonwealth v. Demmitt, 456 Pa. 475, 480-83, 321 A.2d 627, 630 (1974); Commonwealth v. Updergrove, 413 Pa. 599, 601-03, 198 A.2d 534, 535-36 (1964); Accord, Rose I, supra.\nThe well-known test of the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, was sufficient to sustain the conviction of murder of the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Robson, 461 Pa. 615, 625, 337 A.2d 573, 578 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 290, 46 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975). Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 605, 608, 334 A.2d 255, 257 (1975); Commonwealth v. McFadden, 448 Pa. 277, 281, 292 A.2d 324, 326 (1972).\nViewed in this light, the evidence in the case at bar is as follows: Appellant entered the Quartman home at approximately 1:00 p.m. on April 27, 1975, and shot and killed his estranged wife in the presence of several eyewitnesses. The victim\u2019s father, Leroy Quartman, called as a witness for the Commonwealth, testified that his daughter had left her husband the day before and was staying with Mr. Quartman at his house. Appellant entered the Quartman home without knocking and demanded to talk to his wife outside. After a brief exchange, the witness told Fairell, \u201cI am going to call the cops, I think you are coming here for trouble.\u201d Fairell then shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t touch the phone\u201d, and stated that he came to kill everyone in the house. He then pulled a gun from his pocket, aimed it, and shot twice in the direction of his wife, killing her instantly.\nMrs. Ethel Quartman, mother of the victim, testified that when the defendant appeared in the house he told her, \u201cI am going to get you for that smart talk you were talking to me about.\u201d When she retreated towards the kitchen and the telephone, he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t touch that phone . nobody move because everybody is going to get killed in here today.\u201d Frightened, Mrs. Quartman ran down the hall and into the cellar and in a short while heard shooting upstairs.\nThese facts were confirmed by the testimony of two other Commonwealth witnesses: Mary Root, a neighbor who was visiting the Quartmans, who ran upstairs when appellant began firing, and Stanley Quartman, the brother of the victim, who also fled after appellant shot his sister. Both witnesses corroborated the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Quart-man, and stated that they had heard appellant say that he was going to kill everybody in the house.\nThere is clearly sufficient evidence in the record in contradiction of appellant\u2019s assertion that he was so drugged at the time of the shooting that he could not have formed the requisite specific intent. Appellant threatened to kill everyone in the house, subsequently did shoot his wife, and chased Mr. Quartman out of his home, shooting after him. Mrs. Quartman\u2019s unrebutted testimony was that she had known appellant about three years, that appellant was in her home about fifteen minutes before firing the fatal shots, and during this time he threatened her and other people present. Mrs. Quartman further testified that she noticed nothing different about Fairell on that day, that he did not appear to her to have been drinking, and that it appeared to her that he was alert and knew what he was doing. In response to a similar line of questioning, Stanley Quartman stated that, \u201cI seen him [appellant] mean before.\u201d\nThe defense presented the two witnesses mentioned above, appellant\u2019s half-brother, John Nelson, and Dr. Levitt. While Nelson testified that he saw appellant with what appeared to be drugs and that Fairell appeared \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cnot normal\u201d, there was no specific evidence as to what the substance was, or that appellant actually took it, or took any drugs or alcohol. It is also significant that in Mr. Nelson\u2019s signed statement to the police, given the day of the shooting, he made no mention of drugs or anything unusual about his brother\u2019s condition.\nIt is settled law that the trier of fact may believe \u00bfny, all, or none of the testimony offered at trial, and that the credibility of the witnesses is for the trier of fact. Commonwealth v. Robson, 461 Pa. 615, 337 A.2d 573 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 290, 46 L.Ed.2d 265 (1976); Commonwealth v. Smith, 457 Pa. 638, 326 A.2d 60 (1974). Appellant may not rely upon testimony which the trier of fact is not obliged to accept as true.\nDr. Levitt (who, as chief psychologist for the court of common pleas had examined appellant at length and found him competent to stand trial) testified extensively as to appellant\u2019s mental difficulties. He stated that, having testified in criminal cases, both in federal and state courts \u201chundreds of times\u201d, he was familiar with the terms \u201cpremeditation\u201d and \u201cspecific intent\u201d and that appellant had the capacity to form a specific intent, knew right from wrong, and understood the nature and quality of his act.\nFinally, appellant arrived at the Quartman home armed with a loaded gun, was there some fifteen minutes before firing it, during which time he made threats later carried out in part, i. e., that he was going to \u201cget\u201d Mrs. Quartman and that \u201ceverybody is going to get killed here today\u201d. Appellant prevented the witnesses from using the telephone to summon aid, and then used a gun on a vital part of his wife\u2019s body. In light of the above, we hold that the evidence was such that a trier of fact could conclude that there was no reasonable doubt of appellant\u2019s ability to form the specific intent to kill required for a conviction of murder of the first degree. The Commonwealth met its burden of proof with respect to this element of the offense charged, and the conviction is, accordingly, affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., and MANDERINO, J., concur in the result.\n. Appellate jurisdiction of the murder conviction is in this Court by virtue of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, section 202, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202 \u00a7 1. The weapons convictions were appealed first to the Superior Court and by it certified to this Court. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, supra, art. V, \u00a7 503, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503(a). The appeals were then consolidated.\n. Appellant told Dr. Levitt that on the day of the shooting he had purchased and ingested a \u201cFifteen dollar spoon of \u2018Monster\u2019 \u201d and was under the influence of the drug at the time of the shooting. According to the record, \u201cMonster\u201d is a colloquial term for the amphetamine methedrine, i. e., methamphetamine, or \u201cspeed\u201d. Appellant made the same claim in his statement given to the police, which was introduced at the preliminary hearing, N. T. 17-19,5/7/75. The statement was held admissible at the suppression hearing but was not introduced at trial.\nThe court stenographer numbered and bound the transcript of testimony for each day separately, without using consecutive page numbers throughout; therefore all citations necessarily refer to date as well as page number.\n. N. T. 62-99, 10/3/75.\n. John Nelson was not present at trial but his testimony at the suppression hearing was by stipulation incorporated into the trial record as part of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief. N. T. 100, 10/3/75.\n. Murder of the first degree is a willful, deliberate and premeditated unlawful killing. Crimes Code, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, effective June 6, 1973, as amended by Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46, \u00a7 4, immediately effective, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502 (1975 Supp.).\n. At the time of the trial, \u00a7 308 of the Crimes Code provided as follows:\n\u201cIntoxication or drugged condition are not, as such, defenses to a criminal charge; but in any prosecution for any offense, evidence of intoxication or drugged condition of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negative an element of the offense.\u201d\nSection 308 was amended by the Act of April 7, 1976, P.L. 72, No. 32, \u00a7 1, immediately effective, to provide that:\n\u201cNeither voluntary intoxication nor voluntary drugged condition is a defense to a criminal charge, nor may evidence of such conditions be introduced to negative the element of intent of the offense, except that evidence of such intoxication or drugged condition of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to reduce murder from a higher degree to a lower degree of murder.\u201d\n. N. T. 92, 10/2/75.\n. N. T. 119, 10/2/75.\n. N. T. 7-8, 10/3/75.\n. N. T. 34-35, 10/3/75.\n. N. T. 44-45, 10/3/75.\n. N. T. 95, 10/2/75.\n. N. T. 13, 10/3/75.\n. N. T. 16, 10/3/75.\n. Id.\n. N. T. 48, 10/3/75.\n. N. T. 38-44, 10/2/75.\n. N. T. 92-94, 10/3/75.\n. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance due to the temporary unavailability of one of the interrogating detectives whom Fairell wished to question about the detective\u2019s beliefs concerning appellant\u2019s use of narcotics. Although counsel took exception to the refusal of his motion, he did not include the point in his motion for a new trial and/or in arrest of judgment. See, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(a), P.S. Appendix, effective July-23, 1973. The issue is therefore not preserved for review. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975); Commonwealth v. Irwin, 460 Pa. 296, 333 A.2d 735 (1975).",
