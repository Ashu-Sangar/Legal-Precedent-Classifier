        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nOn March 1, 1972, Richard Lane, while represented by privately retained counsel, was convicted of receiving stolen goods in a non-jury trial in Allegheny County. He was placed on probation for five years. No appeal was entered.\nOn January 10, 1975, Lane filed a petition seeking post-conviction relief. After an evidentiary hearing, Lane was permitted to file post-verdict motions nunc pro tunc. The motions were filed and subsequently denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s probation order. We granted allocatur. Throughout these proceedings, Lane had the assistance of new counsel.\nThe sole issue posed by this appeal is whether Lane was denied his constitutional right to effective trial counsel. We are convinced he was and thus reverse.\nDuring his summation and before the trial court had entered a finding as to guilt or innocence, Lane\u2019s trial counsel said this to the court:\n\u201cYour Honor, this Defendant has been in trouble before. I do believe even though he did commit a foolish act here I believe he tried to rectify that act by being very cooperative with Chief Hoover. If he didn\u2019t have a record I would ask Your Honor to give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty. I do believe he paid for what he has done in the past, and I think his story is very plausible. Before he consulted anybody, why, he told the Chief probably the same as he told on the witness stand. I think the only thing he is guilty of is foolishness. I don\u2019t believe there is any proof that he knew the merchandise was stolen, and surely the thieves wouldn\u2019t tell him it was stolen. They wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018We have hot merchandise.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)\nFollowing this the court inquired: \u201cWhat does the record show?\u201d Whereupon it was disclosed that Lane has previously been convicted of three armed robberies, a burglary, and a violation of the Narcotics Act.\nThe test to be applied in determining if trial counsel\u2019s assistance is constitutionally effective is set forth in Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). Instantly, we can discern no reasonable basis designed to effectuate Lane\u2019s interest by trial counsel informing the court of Lane\u2019s prior criminal record before the question of guilt or innocence was resolved. Indeed, it probably was a disservice to Lane\u2019s interests, particularly in view of counsel\u2019s statement \u201c. . . if he didn\u2019t have a record I would ask Your Honor to give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty . . . .\u201d\nIt is urged counsel was engaged in a strategic trial tactic to obtain leniency for his client. We are not so persuaded. At the particular moment, Lane was challenging his guilt and the issue confronting the court was guilt or innocence. We are unable to see how trial counsel\u2019s statement would aid Lane\u2019s claim of innocence.\nThe order of the Superior Court and the probation order of the trial court are reversed, and a new trial is granted.\nPACKEL, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Lane testified at trial and admitted receiving the goods but denied knowing they were stolen.\n. An order placing a criminal defendant on probation is an appealable order. Commonwealth v. Gilmore, 465 Pa. 202, 348 A.2d 425 (1975).",
