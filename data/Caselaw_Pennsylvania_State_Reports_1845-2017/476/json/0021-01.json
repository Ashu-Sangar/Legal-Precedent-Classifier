We also remanded the record to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for it to decide if the claimant had established that his disability had increased from partial to total, since the matter had previously been adjudicated. The Board decided the claimant had met this burden and ordered that he receive Workmen\u2019s Compensation payments for total disability. The employer and its insurance carrier filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court and that court \u201ctransferred\u201d the appeal here.\nThe order of the Board is affirmed.",
