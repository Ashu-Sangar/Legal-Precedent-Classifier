This is a direct appeal from the murder conviction.\nAlthough two issues are raised, only one has been properly preserved for our review. The appellant\u2019s contention that a portion of his suppressed statement was improperly used for impeachment was not raised at trial or in post-verdict motions, and has been waived. Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nThe only issue properly preserved is that the evidence was insufficient to prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt. We have examined this issue and found it to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
