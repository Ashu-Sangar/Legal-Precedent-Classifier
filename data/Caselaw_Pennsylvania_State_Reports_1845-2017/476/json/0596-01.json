Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment from eight to twenty years. This direct appeal followed.\nAppellant claims (1) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; and (2) that he did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial. We have examined these issues and find them to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
