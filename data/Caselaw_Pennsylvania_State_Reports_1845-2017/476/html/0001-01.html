In the instant case there is no question under the evidence but that the child was in the physical custody and control of the husband. There is no justifiable basis for the conclusion that the stepmother was responsible for the nonproduction of the child at a hearing.

Prevention of that assertion of power by the court warranted its civil contempt order against the husband.

We recognize that full faith and credit of custody decrees as a matter of good conflict of laws must be matched by current circumstances as to what is good for the child. “The welfare of the child is always the overriding consideration.

Whether a contempt order should remain in effect after subsequently contested litigation causes a possibly inconsistent situation could be resolved after a factual determination by the hearing court. Among other things, its review can include determinations of the substantive question as to what is best for the child or whether a Pennsylvania court procedurally should make a determination on the merits as to a controversy between a Florida mother and a New York father.</p>

She was unable <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>to comply with the writ of habeas corpus because she did not have custody or control over the child at the time he was directed to be taken to the custody hearing.

    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[294,698,1151,695]]]'>With regard to Donald McKinney’s contempt order, the majority looks beyond the face of the return of service as did the court below. They conclude that since Linda McKinney testified as to giving Mr. McKinney notice, that he should be deemed to have had knowledge of the writ of habeas corpus and, therefore, should be held in contempt of court for his non-compliance. The majority acknowledges the authority of <em>Hollinger v. Hollinger, </em><a href="/pa/416/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="416 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1893016" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0473-01">416 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="206 A.2d 1">206 A.2d 1</a> (1965) for the proposition that residents cannot attack a sheriff’s return when it recites facts showing that service has been effected. However, the majority confines <em>Hollinger </em>to the situation where service was, in fact, effected. The Court in <em>Hollinger </em>stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[335,1407,1108,253]]]'>Our courts have long adhered to the rule that, in the absence of fraud, the return of service of a sheriff, which is full and complete on its face, is conclusive and immune from attack by extrinsic evidence, (cites omitted) <em><a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="206 A.2d 1">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/416/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="416 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1893016" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0473-01">416 Pa. at 476</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="206 A.2d 1">206 A.2d at 3</a>.</blockquote>

In either case the return would be conclusive and immune from attack. This interpretation of <em>Hollinger </em>is supported by the reasoning underlying this rule as set forth in <em>Hollinger. </em>The Court stated:</p>
