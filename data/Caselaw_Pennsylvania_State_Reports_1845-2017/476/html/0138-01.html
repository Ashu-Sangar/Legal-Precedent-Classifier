S., voluntarily placed her <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>two youngest children, T. M. S., then age four, and D. R. S., then age one, in the custody of appellee, Cambria County Children’s Services (Children’s Services). Children’s Services placed the two children in foster care, where they have since remained. Despite repeated warnings from Children’s Services to appellants that their parental rights would be terminated if they failed to make greater efforts to maintain contact with the children and work for the children’s eventual return to the home, appellant H. S. managed to visit them only eight times over a three year period. Appellant R. S. visited them only twice in the 21 months before the orphans’ court hearing. He last visited them more than a year before the hearing. Upon Children’s Services’ petition, the orphans’ court terminated appellants’ parental rights pursuant to section 311(1) of the Adoption Act, which provides for termination of parental rights when it is demonstrated that, for at least six months, a parent has either evidenced a settled purpose to relinquish parental claims to a child, or failed or refused to perform parental duties. Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. Ill, § 311, 1 P.S. § 311(1) (Supp.1977).</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[252,1400,1149,737]]]'>The Opinion of Mr. Justice Nix, heedless of this Court’s obligation to affirm a decree of the orphans’ court supported by competent evidence, selectively re-evaluates the record to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the orphans’ court. By this process, the Opinion of Mr. Justice Nix reads the record to conclude that while the children were in foster care, appellant H. S. continuously attempted to reunite her family. Thus, the Opinion of Mr. Justice Nix would reverse the decree terminating her parental rights. The Opinion of Mr. Justice Nix would also reverse the decree terminating the parental rights of appellant R. S., without any attempt to explain why his nearly total indifference to his children while they remained in foster care does not justify the orphans’ court’s decree.</p>

By August of the same year, H. S., apparently unable to resolve her problem and to cope with the difficulties in caring for her children, contacted Cambria County Children’s Services. The agency succeeded in housing the eldest S. children with relatives and in placing, upon H. S.’s signing a voluntary placement agreement, T. M. S. and D. R. S., in foster homes. By November, H. S. was well enough for the older children to be returned to her; however, due to the inadequacy of the apartment which the family inhabited, the two younger children remained under foster care.

While this fact may be of significance in determining whether there was a “refus[al] or fail[ure] to perform parental duties” it could hardly represent the type of “affirmative indication” of the existence of a “settled purpose” to sever their relationship with their children. To the contrary, the visits negate rather than support the inference that Mr. and Mrs. S. had made a determined choice to sever their relationship with their two youngest children. That appellants did not in fact entertain the finality of purpose to relinquish their parental rights as required by our law is buttressed by competent and unrefuted evidence that they took positive steps to remedy their domestic problems for the purpose of creating a home environment suitable for raising their family. H. S. acquired larger and more adequate housing and obtained additional furniture. Upon inspection, at H. S.’s request, the premises were found to be adequate.</p>

Accepting the fact that the family break-up was largely as a result of H. S.’s alcoholism, whatever blame that might be assigned to H. S. from this fact is offset by her prompt and diligent efforts to remedy her drinking problems. The record also demonstrates that although the family was required to exist on a meager income provided by public assistance, they were able to ultimately obtain and furnish premises that were found to be adequate for the housing of their entire family. A review of the actions of the natural mother during the year preceding the filing of the petition for involuntary termination is particularly illuminating. The record indicates that in October of 1973, Ms. Rebecca Carlin was appointed as caseworker for the family and as such her objective should have been the reunification of the family. The most significant obstacle to that end was the need to obtain appropriate housing for the family unit. At this point, H. S. resided with her three older children and subsisted on a grant of $308.00 per month. Nevertheless, she secured other lodgings in October of 1974. Because this residence required extensive repairs, it took until December of 1974 for the rehabilitation to be completed. On her own initiative, H. S. requested in December of 1974 that the premises be inspected. This request was granted and the caseworker testified that the home was adequate and that <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>promises were made to H. S. that if she could maintain the home reasonably for another two or three months, the children would be returned. Although the evidence establishes that the home was in fact maintained, the promise was not kept but rather the agency responded by filing a petition to terminate. Ms. Carlin’s testimony, which sought to explain the apparent contradiction between her promise and the actions of the agency, leaves much to be desired as is indicated by the following excerpt from the record:</p>

It must be remembered that even though Section 311(1) somewhat relaxed the more stringent requirements of its precursor, it nevertheless requires proof of intent where refusal or failure to perform parental duties is charged, however, the nature of the refusal or failure to perform must be of such magnitude as to justify equating the dereliction with an intentional abandonment. Although this Court has repeatedly stated that parenthood must necessarily entail the responsibility of providing a constant affirmative demonstration of parental love, protection and concern, we have never suggested that this standard be construed to make all but a model parent subject to the possibility of the termination of his or her parental rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">8</a> Recognizing the frailties <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>of human nature, one must necessarily construe Section 311(1) to require conduct (commission or omission) which reasonably warrants a conclusion of abandonment.

In this respect, I agree with the opinion of my brother Roberts that the Mr. Justice Nix’s characterization of the § 311(1) test as requiring evidence “equating dereliction with an intentional abandonment” is contrary to the legislative intent indicated in the 1970 amendments to the Adoption Act.

S. to her children took place. The present petition was not filed, however, until some two years subsequent to the end of that period. During that time, prior to the filing of the present petition by Cambria County Children’s Service (the agency), the agency actively encouraged H. S. to obtain more suitable living arrangements, and H. S. did indeed make such efforts and actively worked with the agency for the return of the children. In my view it would be most unfair to rely upon the antecedent six-month time period (i. e., prior to October 19, 1973) as satisfying the requirements of§ 311(1) of the Act.</p>

Although the petition of the Cambria County Children’s Services included an allegation that termination was justified under Section 311(2) of the Adoption Act, the lower court did not express an opinion on whether there existed the “repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, [or] neglect” which caused the child to be “without essential parental care, control, or subsistence” and which could not and would not be remedied. Act of 1970, July 24, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. III, § 311(2), 1 P.S. § 311(2) (Supp.1977-78). Nevertheless an independent review of the record shows that an order of involuntary termination could not have been based upon the provisions of this particular section. Even if there had been evidence of <em>repeated </em>and <em>continued </em>incapacity, abuse, or neglect, a finding I reject, no testimony whatsoever was adduced concerning the inability or unwillingness of the parents to remedy the situation. To the contrary, the record clearly demonstrates efforts by the parents to provide a better living environment for their children.</p>

Since any contemplated adoption plan of the agency would necessarily be frustrated by a decision dismissing a petition as to the natural mother, no purpose would be served by continuing the inquiry to seek a basis for sustaining the lower court’s action as to the father. Unlike a situation where a natural mother is contemplating another marriage and the adoption of her children by her prospective husband, here the termination of the father’s right would provide, at this time, no benefit for the children. To the contrary, the severance of this relationship could conceivably inure to the detriment of the children.</p>
