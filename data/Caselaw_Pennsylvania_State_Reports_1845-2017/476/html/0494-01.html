I cannot, however, accept appellant’s drastic characterization of the situation confronting her. The record indicates that Mr. Perillo’s refusal to execute the form was due to his mistaken belief that to do so would cause his children to lose the home. Apparently, therefore, a lack of effective communication rather than DPW’s policy was responsible for appellant’s problem. Since section 401 also provides that “assistance shall be administered in such a way and manner as to encourage self-respect, self-dependency and the desire to be a good citizen and useful to society,” I cannot conclude that the policy challenged instantly, which merely requires a member of a family unit to recognize and acknowledge his liability for the public assistance to be provided to his dependents with whom he is living as a condition of that assistance, while it enables him or his family to keep the property so long as it remains his or his family’s home, lacks “due regard for the preservation of family life.”</p>

As indicated previously, the families in appellant’s class are in fact a social and economic unit; the property-owning husband and father living with his dependents, even if he is not more intimately involved in helping to fulfill their needs, can far less readily escape or avoid the financial and emotional consequences of his failure to acknowledge his responsibility for them. The absent husband and father, on the other hand, even if his whereabouts are known and he is easily accessible, is by the very fact of his physical and psychological separation from the family unit less likely to be involved with or affected by its needs. Thus, as DPW suggests in its brief, while efforts are made to obtain his <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>signature on a PA-9 form, it is considered unfair to condition his dependents’ eligibility for assistance on the cooperation of an absent husband and father.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> I therefore find that the difference in treatment between the two classes is based upon a rational and meaningful distinction between their respective situations consistent with the purposes of the AFDC program; thus, the distinction is not an invidious discrimination depriving appellant of equal protection.</p>

This regulation is here used to deny aid to Mrs. Perillo, a cooperating eligible parent, and eligible Perillo children solely because of the noncooperation of Mr. Perillo, a non-recipient of AFDC benefits.

The absent spouse, on the other hand, is less likely, according to the opinion in support of affirmance, to be involved with or affected by the needs of his dependents because of his physical and psychological separation from the family unit. Thus, according to the Department of Public Welfare and the opinion in support of affirmance, it would be unfair to condition eligibility of dependents of an absent spouse upon the cooperation of that absent spouse. Withholding eligibility, however, is not the only means by which the Department of Public Welfare could enforce the statute. As acknowledged by the opinion in support of affirmance, the statute gives DPW the authority to sue for monies received from it by a recipient property owner. Such a remedy is apparently considered adequate by DPW when dealing with absent property-owning spouses. If such <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>a remedy is adequate for absent property-owning spouses, it is also adequate for those property owning spouses living with their dependents.</p>

The Department of Public Welfare should not be allowed to use its position of economic supremacy to extract confessions of judgment from the property owning spouses of those eligible for assistance. The opinion in support of affirmance penalizes one citizen because of another citizen’s refusal to encumber his real estate. Penalizing one citizen for the nonperformance of an act which that citizen does not have the ability to perform is no different than punishing one citizen for the crime of another.

Although <em>Wohlgemuth </em>specifically held the requirement of signing the form was not invalid, the court appeared to assume that this result followed from its determination, following <em>Snell, </em>that the state could legitimately seek reimbursement from the property encumbered. I do not agree. This condition imposes a significant additional eligibility requirement not contemplated by the Social Security Act.</p>
