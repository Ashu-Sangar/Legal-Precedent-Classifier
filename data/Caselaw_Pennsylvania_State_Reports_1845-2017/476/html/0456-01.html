This court established early that the Arbitration Act, rather than becoming the exclusive method of arbitration in Pennsylvania, left commonlaw arbitration intact. <em>Sukonik v.

    <p id="b493-9" data-blocks='[["BL_493.8",493,[180,1364,1152,1005]]]'>A commonlaw arbitration award is not reviewable ón the basis of error of law or fact by the arbitrators. The setting aside of an award is proper only on a showing of denial of a hearing or fraud, misconduct, corruption, or similar irregularity leading to an unjust, inequitable, or unconscionable award. <em>Harwitz v. Selas Corp. of America, supra. </em>Keystone admits the above principle to be applicable here, but claims that the award was contrary to the language of the policy so as to constitute such “other irregularity” as would justify its being vacated. Keystone points to <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Fioravanti, </em><a href="/pa/451/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="451 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1948594" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0108-01">451 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20585" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="299 A.2d 585">299 A.2d 585</a> (1973) to support this premise. In that case, the insured’s granddaughter was struck by an uninsured motorist. The insurer refused to pay, claiming that she was not a member of the insured’s household so as to be covered. In affirming the arbitration award, which required payment under the uninsured motorist provision, we mentioned that a hearing must be “full and fair” to meet the commonlaw procedural standard.</p>

      <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>Keystone points to our statement in <em>Fioravanti </em>that we could hypothesize a situation where an arbitration award could be vacated because of bad faith, ignorance of law, or indifference to justice. It claims that such a situation exists in the instant case. In <em>Fioravanti </em>we elaborated on our hypothesis by citing <em>Smaligo v. Fireman’s F. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/432/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="432 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1919688" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0133-01">432 Pa. 133</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20577" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="247 A.2d 577">247 A.2d 577</a> (1968). In <em>Smaligo, </em>the insured’s daughter was killed by a hit-and-run driver. The arbitrators awarded only $243 in damages after refusing to allow the decedent’s attending physician to testify as to her future work expectancy. We found such refusal to constitute denial of a full and fair hearing because its effect was to completely exclude evidence on a crucial point. We distinguished <em>Fioravanti </em>from <em>Smaligo </em>because no factual evidence or argument was excluded there. The insurer’s counsel expressed the points contained in the memorandum in his opening and closing arguments and his cross-examination of the opposing witnesses. The argument was not excluded. The arbitrators merely declined to have it repeated in another form. Every opportunity was given to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. That was sufficient for a fair hearing. In this case, Keystone does not contend that it was not permitted to present its case to the arbitrators as it saw fit. The award is not objectionable on the basis of <em>Smaligo </em>and <em>Fioravanti.</em>

Unlike the Court, I cannot sanction this drastic rewriting of the policy because it has been done by arbitrators. Hence this dissent.</p>

      <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>Part IV of the insurance policy in issue in this case contains the uninsured motorist coverage. By the terms of this part of the policy, the insurer promises to pay the insured for all bodily injury caused by an “uninsured automobile.” “Uninsured automobile” is a defined term. In pertinent part, the definition is an automobile “with respect to which the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is ... <em>no insurance policy applicable </em>at the time of the accident . . .” (my emphasis). Disputed claims under this part of the policy are to be resolved by arbitration.</p>

To upset an arbitrator’s award, it must be shown “that there was fraud, misconduct, corruption or some other irregularity on the part of the arbitrator which caused him to render an unjust, inequitable or unconscionable award, the arbitrator being the final judge of both law and fact, his award not being subject to disturbance for a mistake of either.” <em>Harwitz v. Selas Corp. of America, </em><a href="/pa/406/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="406 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1304854" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0539-01">406 Pa. 539</a>, 542, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20617" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="178 A.2d 617">178 A.2d 617</a>, 619 (1962). Acting on this concept, we have in a long line of cases given arbitration clauses in uninsured motorist portions of automobile insurance policies a very broad reading, and have almost uniformly upheld the power of the arbitrator to decide the issue before him. See, e. g., <em>Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Medycki, </em><a href="/pa/431/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="431 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1917419" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0067-01">431 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20655" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="244 A.2d 655">244 A.2d 655</a> (1968); <em>Preferred Risk Mut.

Indeed, the parties to the accident settled Mrs. Runewicz’s claim against the other motorist for the full amount of the other driver’s policy, $25,000, and the sum was paid by the other driver’s insurer. It simply cannot be said that the other driver was “uninsured” within the meaning of Mrs. Runewicz’s policy, for the uninsured motorist coverage of that policy rests totally on the condition that the offending motorist will in fact be uninsured. <em>Grange Mut.

This was a question of fact for the arbitrator to resolve.
