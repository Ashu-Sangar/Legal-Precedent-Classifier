After appellant had socialized with the Anderson family for about fifteen minutes, Tina left the home to visit a neighbor. Seconds later, appellant also departed from the Anderson home. It was subsequently learned that Tina never reached the neighbor’s home. However, at 6:20 P.M., a Bethlehem motorcycle patrolman stopped appellant’s vehicle on Stefko Boulevard in Bethlehem for a traffic light violation. The officer observed a passenger in appellant’s vehicle and recorded the number “two” in the “occupant” square on the citation. He later described the passenger as about an eight year old female wearing clothing which matched that worn by Tina Anderson when she left her home.</p>

He introduced his wife to Thelma Anderson, Tina’s mother, and told Mrs. Anderson that he could not take her to the movies that evening as had been arranged during the appellant’s earlier visit. During this conversation he made no mention of having Tina with him in his car earlier that evening. At about 9:30 P.M. that same evening, Mrs. Anderson reported Tina missing. Despite an intensive police search, she was not located that night. The next day, December 12, 1973, Tina was found dead at 1:15 P.M. in a stream behind the Western Electric Plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, by an employee of the City of Allentown. Her body was partially submerged in the shallow stream and a large rock had been placed on her chest in an apparent attempt to prevent the body from floating to the surface.</p>

A pathologist testified that there had been penile entry in the mouth, vagina, and rectum of Tina. He further testified that there were lacerations in both the anus and vagina as well as injuries to the mouth. Based on these findings he concluded that Tina’s death was caused by asphyxiation. It was his judgment that asphyxiation was caused by either penile choking; suffocation resulting from another person’s pubic or lower abdominal regions covering Tina’s face; or suffocation resulting from another person’s body on Tina’s chest. Additionally, he testified that he could not conclusively rule out the possibility of drowning, but that he believed that possibility to be highly unlikely since seminal fluid was found in the mouth and in the event of drowning the fluid would most likely have been washed away. Another Commonwealth witness was Charles LaFever, appellant’s cellmate at Northampton County Prison. LaFever testified that on or about March 10, 1974, apparently during an altercation, appellant said to LaFever: “I killed one.

First, appellant, noting that the Commonwealth had proceeded under a felony-murder theory,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> contends that the evidence presented was insuffi<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>dent to establish any of the requisite underlying felonies. Secondly, it is argued that the evidence fails to establish that death resulted from a criminal agency. We do not agree with either position.</p>

We cannot agree. The lacerations in the area of the anus and vagina and the injury to the mouth clearly suggest a forcible rather than a consensual act. Additionally, support for this conclusion is provided by the patholo<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>gist’s opinion that the victim was most likely suffocated during the sexual assault.

    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[274,625,1152,1181]]]'>We also do not accept appellant’s theory that the evidence would not support a finding of kidnapping as an underlying felony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It is argued that since the intent to sexually molest the young victim may have been formed after Tina was in the company of appellant, the evidence fails to establish that he “unlawfully removed” the child “to facilitate [the] commission of any felony” or “to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim”. The fact that appellant left the house seconds after Tina had departed for the expressed purpose of visiting the home of a neighbor; that he gave no indication to the mother before leaving that he intended to intercept the child; and that he did in fact divert her from her original destination but failed to mention that fact to the mother when he saw her later that evening, all combine to provide ample basis for the conclusion that the felonious intent was present when he induced the child to enter his vehicle that evening. It must be remembered that the burden of proof upon the Commonwealth has never been construed to require it to eliminate every conceivable hypothesis of innocence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The thrust of this argument is that the pathologist, offered by the Commonwealth to prove causation, was not “convinced in his own mind beyond a reasonable doubt” that death resulted from a criminal agency.

The pathologist, after testifying that death resulted from asphyxiation, stated that the suffocation occurred during a sexual assault, i. e., penile choking, or the obstruction of a sufficient air supply. Thus considering all of the prosecution’s evidence the jury was justified in concluding that the accused’s actions caused the death and that the conduct <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>possessed the culpability required for murder of the first degree.</p>
