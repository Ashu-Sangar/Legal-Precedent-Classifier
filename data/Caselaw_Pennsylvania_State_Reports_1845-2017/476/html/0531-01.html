Upon their arrival at that address, the officers proceeded to the third floor apartment of Thomas Green where they found Andrew Banks lying in a pool of blood with a knife next to him. The officers removed Banks to Saint Joseph’s Hospital where he was examined and pronounced dead. The <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>cause of Banks’ death was later established as a single stab wound of the chest. John Colbert was arrested in connection with this incident on December 4,1972, at approximately 2:10 a. m. at 1140 East Phil-Ellena Street and was subsequently charged with Banks’ murder.</p>

Testifying in his own behalf, Colbert stated that he, Banks, Cox and others were drinking in a first floor apartment at 1501 West Girard Avenue for most of the day on December 3,1972; they later went up to Green’s third floor apartment and continued drinking. Colbert further testified that an argument devel<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>oped between himself and Banks while they were on the first floor. The argument grew out of Banks’ accusation that Colbert was “going with [Banks’] girlfriend.” According to Colbert, the argument flared up again in Green’s apartment and during the course of the disagreement, Banks lunged at Colbert with a pocketknife. In retaliation, Colbert stabbed Banks with a kitchen knife he carried in his pocket.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Commonwealth, however, disputed Colbert’s claim of self-defense. Specifically, the Commonwealth refuted Colbert’s version of the stabbing with Cox’s testimony and with the testimony of police witnesses which demonstrated that the knife Banks was alleged to have wielded against Colbert in Green’s apartment was never found, despite a thorough search by the police.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Finally, Detective Donald Lyons <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>testified during rebuttal that he had searched police records and found no indication Banks had ever been arrested.</p>

In addition to his own testimony that he had been drinking “wine, beer and whiskey” all day on December 3, 1972, Colbert’s claim of intoxication is based on Cox’s testimony that Colbert was “intoxicated” and the testimony of Cox’s sister, Mae Hunt, that Colbert “could hardly stand up” when he arrived at her house at 10:30 p. m., approximately one hour after the stabbing occurred. The Commonwealth countered with the testimony of Detective Lyons, who ar<a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>rested Colbert on December 4,1972, at approximately 2:10 a. m., and testified that, although Colbert’s eyes were bloodshot and he smelled of alcohol, Colbert had no difficulty walking, that his speech was not slurred or otherwise abnormal, and that he communicated in a normal, responsive manner. Finally, it is worth noting that Colbert during his own testimony did not profess to have been intoxicated, but rather purported to recall the stabbing and subsequent events quite clearly.</p>
