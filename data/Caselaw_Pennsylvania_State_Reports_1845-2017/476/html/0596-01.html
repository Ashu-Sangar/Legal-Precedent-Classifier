    <p id="b629-11" data-blocks='[["BL_629.11",629,[175,1070,1152,291]]]'>On June 26, 1975, appellant, Lucius Davenport, was tried before a judge sitting without a jury and found guilty of murder of the third degree. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment from eight to twenty years. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b629-12" data-blocks='[["BL_629.12",629,[175,1393,1151,246]]]'>Appellant claims (1) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; and (2) that he did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial. We have examined these issues and find them to be without merit.</p>
    <p id="b629-13" data-blocks='[["BL_629.13",629,[216,1670,616,43]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
