Rule 1100 requires the Commonwealth to bring a case to trial within 180 days of the filing of the criminal complaint against an accused. The calendar judge granted the motion except on the murder and conspiracy charges, reasoning that the arrest of February 10 on these two charges was the relevant date for measuring the Commonwealth’s compliance with Rule 1100 regarding these two charges. On August 11, 1975, 379 days after the first charges were filed, trial commenced, but ended in a mistrial. On December 8, 1975, a second trial began, and a jury found appellant guilty of murder of the first degree and conspiracy. Post-verdict motions, raising the Commonwealth’s failure to comply with Rule 1100, were denied, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment, and this appeal followed.</p>

The Commonwealth reasons that the relevant starting time for measuring the Commonwealth’s <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>compliance with the Rule is February, 1975, when appellant while incarcerated was arrested again for the murder and conspiracy charges, and not July 28, 1974, when appellant was first charged with the offenses arising out of the shooting death of Robert Davis.

Though charges of murder and conspiracy were dismissed at the preliminary hearing held September 4, 1974, other charges were still pending against appellant. Indeed, appellant remained in continuous custody on these charges. Though some of the criminal proceedings against appellant — the murder and conspiracy charges — were dismissed, appellant remained charged with possession of instruments of crime, possession of offensive weapons, aggravated assault, simple assault, and recklessly endangering another person. So long as a portion of the proceedings arising out of the shooting of Robert Davis remained pending, the Commonwealth’s obligation to bring these proceedings against appellant to trial within 180 days remained unaltered.

The conclusion in <em>Campana </em>that all charges involved in one criminal episode are to be tried together does not dictate that they likewise must necessarily be dismissed together.

When the murder and conspiracy charges against Earp were dismissed on September 4 because of the Commonwealth’s failure to establish a prima facie case, the proceedings on those charges were not, as the majority implies, suspended, they were terminated. So far as those two charges were concerned, appellant was completely at liberty from Septem<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>ber, 1974 until February, 1975. To conclude, as the majority does, that the new proceedings for murder and conspiracy subsequently commenced against appellant must relate back to the date of the original arrest ignores the effect of the dismissal of the original charges. The Commonwealth was required to bring a wholly new prosecution against appellant on those charges if it chose to proceed further on them at all,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> and nothing in Rule 1100 dictates that this new proceeding be treated, for purposes of the rule, as something different from what it actually was. Accordingly, the 180-day period of Rule 1100(a)(2), as applied to the murder and conspiracy charges, should be held to have begun anew at the time when appellant was again prosecuted for these charges in February, 1975. See <em>Commonwealth v. Mumich, </em><a href="/pa-super/239/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="239 Pa.

      <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>The majority argues that the murder and conspiracy charges and the lesser charges could not be tried separately under the joinder rules of <em>Commonwealth v. Campana, supra; </em>that the lesser charges were dismissed with prejudice on Rule 1100 grounds; and that therefore the murder and conspiracy charges must also be dismissed, and cannot be tried by themselves. This to me is a non sequitur that loses sight of the salutary purposes which both rules seek to serve. As noted above, the rule announced in <em>Campana </em>that all related charges must be joined for trial did not dictate that because one charge is dismissed at the preliminary hearing stage, all charges must be so dismissed. Similarly, the <em>Campana </em>rule of joinder does not mandate that all such charges must be considered to have been brought on the same date for purposes of Rule 1100, with the consequence that if one charge is to be dismissed with prejudice under that rule, all must be dismissed. Appellant was tried but <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>once on the charges arising out of the shooting of Robert Davis that were then outstanding against him, and hence no violation of the principles of <em>Campana </em>occurred. The trial of these charges, which were brought in February, 1975, was begun in August of that year, as contemplated by Rule 1100.</p>

Whatever “pre-trial suspicion and uncertainty” may have existed for Earp during the interim period, Opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 375, could not have existed with respect to the murder and conspiracy charges, which a judicial officer had dismissed as unfounded. Such burdens were present only as to the lesser charges for which appellant was held and as to which, as the Court notes, he later secured a complete discharge because he was not brought to trial thereon within 180 days.</p>

This statement is insupportable. The Commonwealth does not contend that the time for trial on the lesser charges should have been extended by the new prosecution for murder arid conspiracy; it argues only that the trial for murder and conspiracy could properly be started at any time within 180 days following the commencement of the new criminal proceeding on those charges. This is plainly not a case in which the Commonwealth has acted in bad faith or intentionally sought to evade the mandate of <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>Rule 1100.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> It is clear from the record that Earp was discharged at the preliminary hearing on September 4 only because the Commonwealth did not succeed in persuading the hearing judge that there was a prima facie case of murder against appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> As the trial judge noted in denying appellant’s motion to dismiss the murder and conspiracy charges for non-compliance with Rule 1100, “there was no evidence in this case of purposeful delay . . . ” N.T.

As above noted, the burdens on appellant as an accused person during the period from September 4, 1974 to February 10, 1975 stemmed only from the pendency of the <em>lesser </em>charges that were ultimately, in April, dismissed with prejudice because of violation of the speedy trial rule, a result not contested here by the Commonwealth. There were no other charges outstanding against appellant during this period, and any burdens suffered by him as a result related to a period of pre-arrest delay, not pre-trial delay. This is because appellant was not held for trial on the murder and conspiracy offenses until after his second arrest, and because the provisions of Rule 1100 are not concerned with the prejudice to one’s defense that may be caused by delay in the bringing of criminal proceedings. Whatever <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>prejudice to appellant’s defense may have resulted from the lapse of time between the shooting of Robert Davis on July 28, 1974, and Earp’s second arrest for murder on February 10, 1975 — and I emphasize that no prejudice has been shown — is a matter which affects the accused’s right to due process of law, not his right to a speedy trial under Rule 1100.

Section 2.2(b) of the Standards provides that if a charge has been dismissed on defendant’s motion and a new charge is thereafter brought, the time for trial should begin to run anew from the date of the new charge. The Standards further provide that “[i]f the [original] charge was dismissed upon motion of the prosecuting attorney and thereafter a charge is filed against the defendant for the same offense or an offense required to be joined with that offense, the period of delay from the date the charge was dismissed to the date the time limitations would commence running as to the subsequent charge had there been no previous charge,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="187 A. 498">id.</a> </em>§ 2.3(f), is to be <em>excluded </em>from computing the time for trial; that is, the speedy trial period would be tolled until the new charge is brought.

Appellant contends that there were eight witnesses available and known to the Commonwealth at the time of the first preliminary hearing. Although it is true that the Commonwealth presented one of these witnesses at the first hearing, this, without more, proves nothing. The record does not indicate that these witnesses would have testified at the first hearing, or that their possible testimony would have established a prima facie case against appellant. The Commonwealth’s decision to present only one witness could have been motivated by any number of reasonable considerations, and it is not for an appellate court to second-guess the manner in which the Commonwealth presented its case.</p>
