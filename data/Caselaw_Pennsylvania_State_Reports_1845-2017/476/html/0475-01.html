Here, appellant was represented at trial and on direct appeal by his present PCHA counsel, a member of the Huntingdon Public Defender’s Office, and by the late Edward L. Willard, a Centre County Public Defender. Accordingly, appellant’s claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness is not waived for failure to raise it on direct appeal.</p>

This same consideration is applicable where, as here, PCHA counsel is alleging the ineffectiveness of his co-counsel at trial.

Appellant also alleges he is entitled to post-conviction relief because he was prejudiced (a) when the trial judge “told the DA to be on guard”; and (b) by the delay in holding an evidentiary hearing on the instant petition. We do not agree. The first issue was before this Court on petitioner’s direct appeal where we held the entire testimonial episode, in which the statement here complained of appeared, “did not rise to that level of error so prejudicial as to necessitate a new trial.” <em>Commonwealth v. Fox, </em><a href="/pa/445/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="445 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="1940038" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0076-01">445 Pa. 76</a>, 82-83, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20341" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="282 A.2d 341">282 A.2d 341</a>, 344-45 (1971). The issue has therefore been “finally litigated” and cannot again be raised on collateral attack. Post Conviction Hearing Act, supra, § 4, 19 P.S. § 1180-4(a)(3). The second issue also does not entitle appellant to post-conviction relief. The delay appellant complains of was unavoidable and appellant has not established any prejudice requiring a new trial.</p>
