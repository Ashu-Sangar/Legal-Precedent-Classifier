Appellant prevented the witnesses from using the telephone to summon aid, and then used a gun on a vital part of his wife’s body. In light of the above, we hold that the evidence was such that a trier of fact could conclude that there was no reasonable doubt of appellant’s ability to form the specific intent to kill required for a conviction of murder of the first degree.
