The appellants are Robert J. Butera, Richard J. Tilghman, Stephen F. Friend, Nicholas J. Maiale and James R. Ronca. In addition to the political committee, Pennsylvanians for Shapp-Kline, the appellees are Milton J. Shapp and Ernest P. Kline, who were candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, respectively, in the general election of 1974, and Nancy Mawby, who served as treasurer of the committee.</p>

In their complaint, appellants alleged that as a result of a newspaper article appearing in a Philadelphia newspaper on May 21,1976, they became aware of additional funds contributed to the committee, received before and after the election, which were not reported to the Bureau of Elections. Appellants prayed for an accounting of receipts and expenditures not yet reported, as well as an audit of the accounts. Appellees filed preliminary objections to the petition, including a demurrer, contending (1) that there was no statutory duty to file the supplemental <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>report requested and (2) that the request for an audit was untimely since more than 30 days had elapsed since the filing of the committee’s account on December 5, 1974.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[212,486,1146,803]]]'>The Commonwealth Court sustained respondents’ preliminary objections and dismissed the petition. In its view, the Election Code contemplated the filing of a single expense account within thirty days after an election, and the Code did not oblige a candidate to file “supplemental expense accounts” for contributions received after an election. Second, the court determined that appellant’s request for an audit of the expense account actually filed by the Committee was barred by § 1611 of the Election Code. Since the petition for an audit was filed more than eighteen months after the last day for filing the challenged expense account, and § 1611’s thirty-day period was deemed mandatory rather than directory, the court determined that the petition was untimely. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed the complaint and therefore affirm its order.</p>

See Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 486, §§ 1 et seq., 65 P.S. §§ 261-269 (Supp. 1977) (“Sunshine Law”); Act of June 21, 1957, P.L. 390, §§ 1 et seq., as amended 65 P.S. §§ 66.1-66.4 (1959 and Supp. 1977) (“Right to Know” Act).</p>

Any reading of the statute allowing a lesser degree of disclosure ignores the express legislative language and frustrates the achievement of this clear public policy.</p>

      <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>In deciding whether the legislative directive applies with equal force to post-election receipts and contributions, we must consider how the Legislature has viewed such transactions. Section 1601(e) of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 3221(e), clearly provides that all election expenses are to be treated the same, whether they are incurred before or after the primary or election. Section 1601(e) provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="A8p" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[323,706,1109,365]]]'>“The words ‘election expenses’ shall include all expenditures of money or other valuable things made, and liabilities incurred, in furtherance of or in respect to the election of any candidate for election to any public office, or to defeat the candidacy of any candidate for election to public office, whether such expenditures are made before, during, or after the election.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[282,1088,1151,467]]]'>By including in “election expenses” all expenditures, whether made “before, during, or after the election,” the Legislature has focused not on the timing of a campaign transaction but rather on the public reporting of the financial transaction itself. Thus, in order to file a “full, true, and detailed” account of “election expenses” as directed by Section 1607(a) of the Election Code, those subject to this disclosure requirement are required to report all receipts, contributions, and disbursements.</p>
    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[283,1573,1152,526]]]'>The Election Code’s thirty day filing period seeks to provide the public with the most complete accounting possible shortly after every election. But nothing in the Election Code suggests that campaign financial transactions occurring beyond the thirty day period are intended to be undisclosed and unreported. These transactions occurring after the filing period provide just as much potential for abuse as those antedating expiration of the filing period. The integrity of the electoral process is not advanced by requiring only that pre-filing transactions be disclosed.</p>
    <p id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[284,2119,1150,259]],["BL_523.1",523,[192,303,1150,361]]]'>There is no reason to refuse to account for campaign contributions and receipts occurring after the first accounting. To interpret the Election Code to allow campaign contributions and receipts after the first filing date to remain unreported may encourage some persons involved in <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>campaign financing to postpone campaign financial transactions until thirty days after an election and thus avoid the potentially embarrassing consequences which may accompany certain campaign contributions and receipts. The majority’s reading of the Election Code approves a scheme which easily destroys the disclosure provisions which the Legislature intentionally put into the Election Code.</p>

How then can it be said that the December, 1974 account was a “full, true, and detailed,” accounting of “each and every” receipt and expenditure of the Committee? Because the Election Code requires full disclosure of campaign financing, supplemental accounting is essential if a committee and candidates are to fulfill the statutory disclosure provisions. The majority’s interpretation to the contrary negates entirely the important purposes of the campaign financing disclosure provisions.</p>

Within thirty days of the last day for filing of expense accounts, any five electors are entitled to petition for an audit of the account filed.

Recent developments, both in and out of this Commonwealth, firmly indicate that the public interest in the integrity of elections must be promoted, rather than frustrated. In light of our Commonwealth’s goal of ensuring full, honest, and complete disclosure, and <em>McErlean’s </em>recognition of the need for the availability of such chai<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>lenges-, it must be concluded that the thirty day time period is not intended to bar petitions for audits where an election expense account, though filed within the statutory time period, is not “full, true, and detailed” as required by Section 1607(a) of the Election Code. Thus, where electors have a reasonable basis, as this record establishes, for concluding that a timely election expense account has not satisfied the statutory requirement of a “full, true, and detailed” accounting, the thirty day time provision can have no applicability.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[195,858,1151,527]]]'>When appellee Nancy Mawby disclosed that certain campaign contributions made to the Committee were not reported in the December, 1974 election expense account, appellants could reasonably conclude that the December, 1974 election account was not “full, true, and detailed.” The reasonableness of their conclusion is fully supported by the record. Because these electors had no reason to believe that the December, 1974 account was incomplete when filed, the thirty day period should not apply and thus these electors should be permitted to compel an audit.</p>

    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[194,1502,1152,631]]]'>The Election Code imposes at least two obligations of campaign financing disclosure on political candidates and their committees: (1) to file an election expense account within thirty days of an election; and (2) to file a “full, true, and detailed” account. This dual responsibility is not satisfied by simply filing within the thirty day time period. Such procedural conformity cannot satisfy the far more important substantive obligation requiring complete disclosure of all receipts and contributions. Both the Legislature and the public are far more interested in ensuring that everybody is given a plain view of a candidate’s financial support.</p>
    <p id="b525-8" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[194,2156,1150,205]],["BL_526.1",526,[258,332,1149,520]]]'>Those who seek to be entrusted by the public with the responsibilities of public office must set an example not only of leadership, but also of integrity in their responses to the public interest in the conduct of their election and govern<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>mental affairs. These examples are not set nor is the public interest served when that which is public business is kept from public scrutiny. Because the Legislature requires “full, true, and detailed” disclosure of election affairs, it is no answer to say — as the majority does — that the Election Code is insufficient and that the remedy for this failure to disclose lies with the Legislature. This Court should not condone appellees’ attempt to circumvent the important requirement of full public disclosure of campaign financing set forth in the Election Code.</p>
