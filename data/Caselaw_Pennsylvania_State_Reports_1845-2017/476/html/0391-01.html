Appellant argues that it was error for the trial court to permit Marilyn Wallace to testify that she had last seen her husband alive on the morning that he was killed. Appellant contends that this testimony was irrelevant because the Commonwealth had other witnesses who could testify that the victim was alive on the morning of July 3, 1974. Appellant asserts that even if this testimony was relevant, its prejudice outweighed its probativeness. Compare <em>Commonwealth v.

Because we conclude that the photographs of the victim and his daughter and the testimony of Marilyn Wallace concerning the victim’s family status and personal life were erroneously admitted into evidence, we need not reach appellant’s claim that Marilyn Wallace’s testimony that she last saw her husband alive on the morning that he was killed was improperly admitted into evidence.</p>

Appellant contends that the evidence that the victim’s daughter was handicapped exacerbated the prejudicial nature of the evidence of the victim’s family status. The Commonwealth argues that appellant cannot claim that he was prejudiced by the testimony that the victim’s daughter attended school at the home for crippled children because on voir dire appellant asked the veniremen whether they or their families had contributed to the Jennifer Wallace Fund, which was set up after the victim’s death to help support his daughter. The Commonwealth fails to note that all the veniremen who became part of the jury stated that they or their families had not contributed to the fund. Moreover, the question on voir dire inquired only whether the jurors had contributed to the Jennifer Wallace Fund. The question did not reveal that Jennifer Wallace was handicapped. Marilyn Wallace’s testimony was the only evidence which indicated that Jennifer was handicapped.</p>

The Commonwealth misses the point. The photographs of the victim with his daughter were irrelevant and prejudicial regardless whether they revealed that Jennifer was handicapped. The photographs of the victim-father with his daughter vacationing on a beach had no place in appellant’s trial. Moreover, the Commonwealth is incorrect in its contention that the photographs did not accentuate the testimony which revealed that Jennifer was handicapped. Although the record does support the Commonwealth’s contention that the photographs do not indicate that Jennifer was handicapped, the photographs do accentuate the prejudice to the accused, for the jurors could apply their awareness of Jennifer’s condition to the photographs. Thus, we believe that the photographs exacerbated the prejudicial nature of Marilyn Wallace’s testimony.</p>

The determination whether an error is harmless because of overwhelming evidence is closely tied to the facts of a particular case, requiring examination of the entire record. Unfortunately, this determination is often made with little or no analysis. See Field, supra, note 16 at 36 (“the overwhelming evidence test . . entails a commitment to examine in detail what may be a very complicated and extensive record only to render a decision devoid of precedential value because so closely tied to the facts of the case”). Thus, it is not surprising that a few of our cases do not say whether the overwhelming evidence was uncontradicted. Even so, our research reveals no case in which this Court clearly departed from the <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>requirement that an error cannot be found harmless on the basis of overwhelming evidence unless the evidence is uncontradicted.</p>

The <em>Winship </em>rule applies not to every iota of evidence introduced in a trial, but rather to the sum of the evidence bearing on an element of the crime; that is, when looking at the record as a whole, can it be said that the Commonwealth has proved every fact necessary to constitute the crime with <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>which the defendant is charged beyond a reasonable doubt?

Appellate review would gain in forthrightness as well as reason if appellate courts could judge it highly probable, rather than almost certain, that an error did not affect the judgment.

We are not unmindful of the feelings of outrage which attend the cruel and senseless murders of innocent citizens or the concern of the victims and of society that the perpetrators be apprehended and punished. It is, however, precisely these emotions which can endanger an individual’s right to be presumed innocent. Courts have a duty to insulate a jury from such influences so as to assure as far as possible that a verdict is the result of a dispassionate consideration of the question whether the <em>defendant </em>did indeed perpetrate the acts of which he stands charged.</p>

For example, might an otherwise overwhelming case be contradicted simply by an unsupported defense assertion of alibi?

As Chief Justice Traynor noted: “Concededly, once he [an appellate judge] undertakes to evaluate error, he is driven to reviewing the whole record, even to weighing the evidence. Nevertheless I believe that in the process it is possible for him deliberately to put aside the question of the correctness of the judgment.
