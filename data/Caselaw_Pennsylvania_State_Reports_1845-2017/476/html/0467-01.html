Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a bill of particulars, requesting “a copy of any statements or confessions made by [appellant], either orally or in a written form, or reduced to writing in a report by an agent of the Commonwealth and attributed to [appellant], made at any time since the inception of this matter.” At a pretrial conference and again at trial, the trial judge ordered all such statements turned over to appellant. It is undisputed that appellant gave an oral statement to investigating officers, and that the investigating officer took notes on appellant’s statement which were <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>included in a written report. It is also undisputed that the prosecution had possession of this, report at all relevant times. Despite the presence of this report in the prosecution’s files, the assistant district attorney handling the case consistently denied its existence, repeatedly assuring the court and defense counsel that no such statements existed.</p>

In substance the report stated that appellant had told the officer that appellant, in his capacity as manager of the prison kitchen had spoken to the victim the morning of the stabbing incident. The appellant’s oral statement, reduced to writing by the police officer in his report, was contrary to appellant’s trial testimony.</p>
