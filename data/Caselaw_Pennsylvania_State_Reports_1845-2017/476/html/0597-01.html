    <p class="author" id="b631-6" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[223,592,291,34]]]'>PER CURIAM.</p>
    <p id="b631-7" data-blocks='[["BL_631.7",631,[180,661,1151,206]]]'>Appellant was indicted on charges of murder, voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. She was tried before a jury and convicted of murder of the third degree.</p>
    <p id="b631-8" data-blocks='[["BL_631.8",631,[222,895,822,43]]]'>Appellant makes the following arguments:</p>
    <p id="b631-9" data-blocks='[["BL_631.9",631,[179,991,1152,142]]]'>1. There was allegedly insufficient evidence to support a finding of malice, necessary for a conviction of murder.</p>
    <p id="b631-10" data-blocks='[["BL_631.10",631,[179,1195,1150,152]]]'>2. The Commonwealth allegedly failed to establish a causal connection between the conduct of the defendant and the death of the victim beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p id="b631-11" data-blocks='[["BL_631.11",631,[179,1399,1151,195]]]'>3. The trial court allegedly erred in giving the jury additional instructions at 12:25 A.M. where there was no request for further instructions and the jury had not indicated it was deadlocked.</p>
    <p id="b631-12" data-blocks='[["BL_631.12",631,[178,1655,1152,152]]]'>4. The trial court allegedly erred in sending out to the jury photographs of the body of the victim during deliberations of the jury without notice to defense counsel.</p>
    <p id="b631-13" data-blocks='[["BL_631.13",631,[177,1859,1150,205]]]'>5. The trial court allegedly erred in admitting as exhibits photographs of the body of the decedent and in displaying these photographs to the jury both at trial and during deliberations.</p>
