A plurality opinion (Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Jones and O’Brien) stated that § 8-409 of the charter did not grant subpoena power.

Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for himself and two of the Justices, concluded that the district attorney’s power to obtain the production of witnesses was “by court issued subpoenas, at preliminary hearings, grand jury proceedings and trials” (<a href="/pa/424/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="424 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1904922" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0508-01">424 Pa. at 519</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20382" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="228 A.2d 382">228 A.2d at 387</a>).

There were alternative bases for the conclusion reached by the court, i. <em>e., </em>whether the district attorney of Philadelphia should be viewed as a state official or as a municipal official.

Being a prerogative writ of the king it was originally employed exclusively by the Court of King’s Bench, but subsequently issued out of the Courts of Chancery, Common Pleas and Exchequer as well. Its principal purpose is to prevent an inferior judicial tribunal from assuming a jurisdiction with which it is not legally vested in cases where damage and injustice would otherwise be likely to follow from such action.

In any event, this appears to be a classical case for this Court to assert its supreme power to prevent an inferior court from going out of its bounds in disregard of a prior holding of this Court. “The extraordinary Writ of Prohibition is issued as a matter of discretion to prevent a lower court from acting outside its jurisdiction and to prevent it from abusing its discretion. <em>McNair's Petition, </em><a href="/pa/324/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="324 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1171378" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0048-01">324 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="187 A. 498">187 A. 498</a> (1936).

Yet, public concern, particularly in the criminal law field, with respect to the inadequacy of an ordinary appeal as well as proper order and regularity in judicial proceedings calls for the use of the writ of prohibition. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
