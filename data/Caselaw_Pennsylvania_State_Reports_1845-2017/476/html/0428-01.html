That section, stark in its brevity, was distinguished by a complete lack of direction as to the circumstances that would warrant imposition of the death penalty. In contrast to the elaborate mechanism of the Act of 1939, <em>supra, </em>n.7, the new legislation provided only that “[a] person who has been convicted of murder of the first degree shall be sentenced to death or to a term of life imprisonment.” It is manifest that in no way could § 1102 have been designed to cure the constitutional infirmities of the Act of 1939. It would seem, instead, that § 1102 had no purpose other than to provide some legislative authority for the imposition of a death sentence until the General Assembly could formulate an adequate response to the implications of the <em>Furman </em>decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> But because § 1102 leaves totally <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>unbridled discretion in the finders of fact to determine whether execution or life imprisonment is the proper penalty, it was clearly within the interdiction of our <em>Bradley </em>decision and the other Pennsylvania progeny of <em>Furman </em>cited above.</p>

The Commonwealth recognizes this but offers an evidentiary record, not present in those cases, purporting to show that there has been no discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty on the basis of race, wealth, or nature of the proceeding leading to conviction (jury trials <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>vs. pleas of guilty). However, as we recognized in the above cases, <em>Furman </em>holds that ‘the imposition of the death penalty <em>under statutes, such as here involved, </em>is violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.’ <em>Commonwealth v. Scoggins, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/451/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="451 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1948628" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0472-01">451 Pa. at 481</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="304 A.2d 102">304 A.2d at 108</a> (emphasis added). Had we viewed evidence of the actual application of the statute as necessary for determination of its constitutionality, we would have directed evidentiary hearings in those cases. As we understand <em>Furman, </em>the constitutional prohibition extends at least to all death sentences imposed pursuant to statutes which give the sentencing authority unfettered discretion in imposition of the death penalty.

It was not, however, designed to block giving effect to a strong public interest, which itself is a jurisprudential concern. It is evident from the record that Gerard McKenna personally prefers death to spending the remainder of his life in prison. While this may be a genuine conviction on his part, the waiver concept was never intended as a means of allowing a criminal defendant to '“choose his own sentence.

The <em>Furman </em>decision evoked a wide legislative reaction throughout the United States, with some thirty-five states adopting new death penalty statutes. The remedial legislation invariably took one of two forms. The first type provided for mandatory sentences of death for specified crimes (this type of statute was later found unconstitutional in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">428 U.S. 280</a>, <a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">96 S.Ct. 2978</a>, <a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">49 L.Ed.2d 944</a> (1976)). The second general form of statute provided for specific aggravating and mitigating circumstances which would direct the jury to a less arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty (a statute of this sort was approved in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em><a href="/us/428/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="428 U.S. 153" data-case-ids="6176749" data-case-paths="/us/428/0153-01">428 U.S. 153</a>, <a href="/us/428/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="428 U.S. 153" data-case-ids="6176749" data-case-paths="/us/428/0153-01">96 S.Ct. 2909</a>, <a href="/us/428/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="428 U.S. 153" data-case-ids="6176749" data-case-paths="/us/428/0153-01">49 L.Ed.2d 859</a> (1976) and a number of companion cases handed down the same day).

I am of the view that my insistence upon a precise formulation of the issue presented is more than a quibble but rather is imperative to a proper resolution of the question. While I concede that a similar issue might have arisen in a waiver context, I do not believe that fact alone justifies obliterating the distinction between waiver and sua sponte review. Where there is an absence of sentencing power, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>this Court’s supervisory power requires that it provide a remedy, even if sua sponte consideration is necessary to effectuate that relief. However, where a tribunal possesses the sentencing authority and is alleged to have misused or abused that authority, then I believe that the normal rules of appellate procedure should obtain and sua sponte review is unwarranted. In any event, the question raised is not whether waiver rules should be relaxed but rather whether this Court charged with its constitutional supervisory authority should sua sponte respond regardless of the wishes of the parties or their diligence in preserving the issue.</p>

In <em>Piper </em>we declined to consider a claim that the sentence denied the accused equal protection of the law since a male offender would have received a minimum sentence and she did not. The basis for not reviewing the claim was her failure to pursue the claim either in the trial court or the Superior Court. The distinguishing feature of <em>Piper </em>is that the validity of the maximum sentence was unquestioned. It is axiomatic in this jurisdiction that the maximum sentence is the legal sentence which determines the length of the State’s control over the offender. <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa/458/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="458 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="479706" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0289-01">458 Pa. 289</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="328 A.2d 851">328 A.2d 851</a> (1974); <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus the claim in <em>Piper </em>did not amount to an assertion that a court had exceeded its statutory sentencing power or that the legislature was constitutionally proscribed from promulgating such a sanction, but rather the attack was directed to the disparity in the treatment of male and female offenders. We have since had occasion to note that because the minimum merely serves to trigger parole considerations, the female offender benefited from the disparity. <em>Commonwealth v.
