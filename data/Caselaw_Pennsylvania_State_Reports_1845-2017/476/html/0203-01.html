On appeal to this Court, appellant, in addition to contending that the questions presented are not moot, claims that Section 417 is overly broad and thus violative of due process and further asserts that involuntarily committed mental patients have a common law right to refuse treatments, which right cannot, in the absence of judicially declared incompetence, be negated by the state.

It is conceded that the questions raised by appellant concerning the rights of involuntarily committed mental patients are of public importance. However, as the case law cited above indicates, the appellate courts of this jurisdiction have infrequently invoked the great public importance exception to the mootness doctrine. In <em>Wortex Mills </em>this Court was confronted with a significant question involving the interface between constitutional law and labor law and still declined to resolve the issue, because it was moot. <em>Wortex Mills v. Textile Workers, supra. </em>What is controlling in the instant case is that the legislature obviously recognized the significance of questions involving rights of mental patients and, therefore, enacted the Procedures Act subsequent to the time that this appeal was taken. As noted before, the Procedures Act deals squarely with the issues appellant raises. In view of the new comprehensive statutory scheme, there is no longer a need to assess the validity of the former scheme.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Thus, we hold that the instant appeal does not fall within the great public importance exception to the mootness doctrine.</p>

Appellant attempts to bring his case within the scope of this exception by arguing in essence that he could be recommitted, involuntarily treated, and then released again before an appeal from a denial of injunctive relief could reach this Court. While this argument would be impressive if the basis of our holding of mootness rested solely upon the fact of appellant’s discharge from W.P.I.C., it is not persuasive where mootness has been determined because of a change in the law, particularly where this change attempts to address the objections raised by appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Thus, we conclude that the instant appeal does not present a necessarily recurring question.</p>

It should be noted that while both of appellant’s previous involuntary commitments were the result of proceedings under Section 406 of the Mental Health Act, Section 406 was expressly repealed by the Procedures Act. 50 P.S. § 7502 (Supp. 1977-78). By now requiring a showing of severe mental disability, the Procedures Act establishes a significantly higher standard for involuntary commitment, thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that appellant will be recommitted. <em>See <a href="/us/419/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="419 U.S. 393" data-case-ids="6175706" data-case-paths="/us/419/0393-01">id.</a> </em>§ 7301.</p>

Appellant then asks us to conclude that should he discontinue the drug therapy now prescribed by his physician, he would be recommitted to W.P.I.C. We agree with appellee that such a conclusion could be reached only if the factual stipulation is distorted. The stipulation shows clearly that it was appellant’s own physician, not W.P.I.C., who exacted from appellant the agreement to <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>continue in drug therapy. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>The only logical conclusion that can be drawn from this correct statement of the stipulated facts is that should appellant decide to discontinue drug therapy, his physician will cease treating him.
