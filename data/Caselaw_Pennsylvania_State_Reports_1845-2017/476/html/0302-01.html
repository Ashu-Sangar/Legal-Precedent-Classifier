In an attempt to discover detailed information bearing on these employment practices, the Commission again sent interrogatories to respondent, requesting that they be answered. Respondent refused, whereupon the Commission formally ordered compliance within fifteen days.

The Commonwealth Court held that the Commission’s twice-amended complaint met the particularity requirement of § 9 of the PHRA, but refused to enforce the Commission’s order that respondent answer the interrogatories. Although it was the Commission’s prerogative to issue and <em>request </em>answers to interrogatories, in its view it could not judicially enforce an order to answer interrogatories since the PHRA did not authorize use of interrogatories as a means of discovery.</p>

A complaint lodged by the Commission, no less than a complaint filed by any other moving party, must “set forth the particulars” of the alleged discriminatory practice. The Commission’s complaint, after identifying the parties involved, asserts that respondent “discriminates in its hiring of Blacks and females and fails or refuses to utilize recruitment sources which will, or may reasonably be expected to, provide it with Black and female applicants.” This assertion is followed by statistics such as the percentage of Blacks in respondent’s work force in comparison to the percentage of Blacks in the surrounding county, the number of minorities employed in managerial <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>positions, and the percentage of females at respondent’s place of business in comparison to the percentage of females in the area. Based on these statistics obtained from the EEOC, the complaint concludes by charging that “Respondent maintains a pattern and practice of discriminating on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in its hiring, classification, and promotion policies, and its employment practices in connection therewith.”</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[246,766,1151,842]]]'>The statistics demonstrate substantial employment imbalances at respondent’s place of business. The complaint demonstrates the fact that respondent hires fewer women than men, has a disproportionate number of Caucasian employes in managerial positions, employs a smaller percentage of Blacks than the percentage residing in the surrounding county. The complaint does more than give respondent <em>notice </em>that a complaint has beén filed against it; it informs it of the <em>facts </em>giving rise to the Commission’s reason to believe that respondent is engaging in unlawful employment practices. Hence, the complaint comports with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1019, which this Court has suggested guides us in assaying the sufficiency of a complaint under § 9 of the PHRA. <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm’n v. United States Steel, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/458/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="458 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="479731" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0559-01">458 Pa. at 565</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=325%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="325 A.2d 910">325 A.2d at 913</a>.</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[245,1648,1151,582]]]'>Appellee argues that the complaint is not “free of substantial defect” nor “legally adequate” because the Commission could have interviewed respondent’s representatives and employes in order to determine the reasons for the imbalance. We do not agree. The filing of the complaint in no way militates against voluntary compliance by St. Joe; a respondent is still at liberty to explain away racial or sex imbalances. The purpose of the complaint under § 9 is to apprise the Commission of the employment practices which may prove to be unlawful, and the Commission’s figures sufficed to warrant further investigation.</p>
    <p id="b340-7" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[245,2262,1149,97]],["BL_341.1",341,[242,317,1151,532]]]'>Appellee also argues that because the complaint, filed in January, 1975, is based on employment statistics compiled <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>for the year 1972, it fails to comport with § 9. Again we do not agree. Many employment relationships are not short term. The racial or sexual composition of an employer’s work force generally does not undergo a drastic change from year to year. Indeed, respondent does not allege that were more recent statistics compiled, they would reflect different ratios than those documented in the 1972 figures. We think the Commission could reasonably conclude that substantial racial imbalances existing at respondent’s plant in 1972 would still exist two or three years later.</p>

The former consumes only the time the Commission is willing to invest, and places the burden on the Commission to elicit information which indicates unlawful discrimination. The latter places a substantial burden on the employer in terms of both time and money, possibly requiring the hiring of additional employes to locate and compile the requested information. More fundamentally, allowing the use of interrogatories relieves the Commission of the burden of investigating possible PHRA violations: it would require the employer, not the Commission, to procure the information which might prove incriminating. In view of these differences, and the fact that the legislature empowered the Commission to subpoena witnesses and documents, we reject the view that compelling answers to interrogatories is necessarily implied in the Commission’s investigative powers. The term “investigate” is admittedly broad.

We are concerned here with a legislative grant of power to the Human Relations Commission to combat discrimination, a grant accompanied by specific investigative tools backed by judicial enforcement if necessary.

There, the agency was not expressly authorized by statute to compel filing of reports describing a company’s compliance with a cease-and-desist order. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court upheld the FTC’s power to gather the information in the challenged manner by reading other statutory grants of power to the FTC to include the specific circumstances.

[The agency has power] more analogous to the Grand Jury, which does not depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.

I do not agree. Nothing in the record indicates that compliance will subject St. Joe or any other party to unreasonable hardships. Nor is the existence of such hardship so indisputable as to justify this Court’s recognition of it absent supporting evidence. Indeed, because parties such as St. Joe routinely gather information about their businesses, answering most, if not all, questions should require minimal effort.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[231,1209,1153,739]]]'>If certain interrogatories prove unduly burdensome, a party could challenge them in an orderly manner before the PHRC or in an enforcement proceeding. A court may, when necessary in a particular case, consider the reasonableness of specific interrogatories to which a party has objected and grant the necessary relief. See Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, § 10, as amended, 43 P.S. § 960. But the mere possibility of such occasional hardship cannot justify the majority’s blanket prohibition against all written interrogatories. I cannot condone this relegation of the PHRC to rigid procedural devices, frustration of the PHRC’s performance of its statutory role, and destruction of the express policy of the Commonwealth in this important area of human relations.</p>
