On May 30, 1971, the dead body of Robert Lee Jones was discovered in the apartment of appellant’s estranged wife, Deborah Galloway. Two persons, appellant and one George Quinn, were charged with the killing of Jones. Quinn was arrested on the day of the shooting, but appellant remained at large for some time. Prior to the apprehension of appellant, Quinn was brought to trial and acquitted. During this trial Quinn gave testimony which implicated appellant in the shooting of Jones.</p>

      <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>At appellant’s trial, Quinn was called by the Commonwealth to testify as he had at his own trial relative to Galloway’s involvement. Upon being sworn and questioned, Quinn invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Although informed that he had been granted immunity from prosecution, Quinn persisted in his refusal to testify. The trial court then placed Quinn in custody with a copy of the transcript of the testimony he gave at his own trial. When recalled to the stand the next day and questioned by the Assistant District Attorney concerning the events surrounding Jones’ death, Quinn testified that although he had read the notes of his testimony from his own trial at least twelve times, he had no present recollection of the facts which he related at his own trial, and had no present recollection regarding the accuracy of the transcript of his testimony from that trial.</p>

Accordingly, before addressing the merits of the constitutional question raised by appellant, it is appropriate first to determine whether Quinn’s prior testimony was admitted properly under the hearsay exception for former testimony. Galloway’s confrontation claim becomes ripe for review only if Quinn’s former testimony is found to have been correctly admitted under state evidentiary law.</p>

In the context of the present case, we believe a ruling of unavailability^ if proper, requires the conclusion that Quinn was unavailable for all purposes.

The testimony of Quinn was, however, the only evidence introduced to indicate that Quinn himself was not present in the apartment at the time of the alleged shooting. Further, and more importantly, part of the direct examination of Quinn which was read to the jury contained a statement by Quinn’s attorney that “Mrs. Galloway testified that everybody knows Cornell always has a gun with him.” This was the only evidence presented at appellant’s trial which linked appellant with a gun. While proof that appellant carried a gun is not necessary to support a finding of guilt, we cannot conclude that appellant was not seriously prejudiced by this statement.</p>
