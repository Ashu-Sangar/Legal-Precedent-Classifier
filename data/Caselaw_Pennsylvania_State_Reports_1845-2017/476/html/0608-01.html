At the time of this separation, the husband was working and was attempting to support his wife and child. When the mother left the father in January of 1973, she did not leave a forwarding address and did not leave any information as to where he could find his wife and child. The father made an attempt to find the mother and the child by asking a friend, ... to help him find them and further, he telephoned his wife’s mother, Mrs. [D.] in March, April and May in order to locate his wife and child. Mrs. [D.] would not help him and informed the father that she did not know where her daughter was and that she wouldn’t tell him if she did know. In addition, Mrs. [D.], the father’s mother-in-law, threatened to have him arrested and placed under a peace bond if he continued to make telephone calls. Inasmuch as Mrs. [D.] had previously obtained a peace bond on the father, the father refrained from making additional calls and from May of 1973, until September, 1973, he had his friend or his grandmother place calls to Mrs. [D.] inquiring as to the whereabouts of his wife and child.</blockquote>

When it became evident that the mother was not going to allow the visits of the child with the father, the meetings ceased. In November and December of 1973, the father called his wife on several occasions and was permitted to talk to the baby. Further, the father continued to request visitations but the mother refused to allow the same. At Christmas in 1973, the father delivered gifts for his child consisting of clothes and Tonka trucks. These gifts were left at the home of his mother-in-law, Mrs. [D.], who accepted the gifts on behalf of the child. In January of 1974, the wife divorced the husband and at that time the husband-father was incarcerated at the Allegheny County Jail. The father was in the Allegheny County Jail from January, 1974, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>until June of 1974. In February of 1974, while still incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail, the father requested his attorney ... to obtain information as to visitation rights to his son. Further, while the father was in jail, he sent approximately 30 letters to his mother-in-law’s home inquiring about the welfare of his child plus birthday and Easter cards were sent to the child. He also requested a photograph of his child. Although a return address was on all of the letters that were sent to his former mother-in-law’s address, none of the letters were returned and the father received no response to his letters until June of 1974 when he received a threatening letter from [G.S.], who was then his former wife’s fiance. At this time [G.S.] informed the father that he would not permit the former wife to bring the child ... to visit the father. The father responded to [G.SJ’s letter by a letter informing [G.S.] that he was concerned about his son and he intended to obtain visitation privileges. From June, 1974, through March of 1975, the father was then incarcerated in the State Correctional Institution at Huntington. Due to regulations at the Institution, the father was not allowed to make calls to his son. At Christmas of 1974, the father sent his son a Christmas card and directed one of his friends to take gifts to his son. In addition, the father requested his Parole Officer ... to make arrangements for visitation with his son. In January and February of 1975, he wrote letters to his former wife offering to pay support for his son if and when he was released from prison and he also requested his former wife to allow him visitation rights to see his son. In March of 1975, the father was released from Huntington and in the months of April and May, he called his former wife on a number of occasions in order to contact his son, but the former wife would hang up on him.</blockquote>

In September of 1975, the father requested his fiancee ... to call the mother to inquire about his son and further he requested her (his fiancee) to get <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>photographs of the son and try to arrange a visitation. The fiancee ... did make telephone calls in September and October to the mother of the child, but they were to no avail. In the first or second week of November, 1975, the father met one [N.P.] of the American Red Cross and requested his assistance in obtaining visitation rights with his son. On December 2, 1975, [N.P.] received a written letter from the father again requesting help in obtaining a visitation with his son. On December 12,1975, Mr. [P.] attempted to contact the mother through her father and on December 15, 1975, the mother called Mr. [P.] by telephone and told him that she was going to terminate the father’s parental rights to his child by a legal proceeding. On December 18, 1975, Mr. [P.] related to the father his conversation with the father’s former wife and explained to him that the wife intended to institute a proceeding to terminate his parental rights. In December of 1975, the father again sent Christmas gifts and cards to his son. The father appeared to the Court to be a very sincere witness and announced his willingness to pay support for his son to the extent that he is able.</blockquote>

The orphans’ court found that, “in November and December of 1973, the father called his wife on several occasions and was permitted to talk with the baby.” Appellant correctly points out that the father testified that he was permitted to talk to his son only once during these months. This discrepancy is irrelevant. The issue is whether the father used all resources available to contact his son. That the mother refused any or all of the father’s calls does not detract from the father’s attempts to communicate with his son. Similarly, appellant argues that the orphans’ court erred in finding that “in the months of April and May [1975], [the father] called his <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>former wife on a number of occasions in order to contact his son, but the former wife would hang up on him,” when the record shows only two such calls. Assuming that two calls do not amount to “a number of occasions,” the record as a whole still supports the conclusion of the orphans’ court.</p>

We disagree. The determination of credibility is solely for the trier of fact. E. g., <em>Garges Estate, </em>supra (conflicting evidence of common law marriage); <em>Wertman Estate, </em>supra (chancellor believed lay testimony over conflicting expert testimony). It was the task of the orphans’ court to resolve the conflicting testimony of these witnesses. Therefore, the orphans’ court did not abuse its discretion by crediting the testimony of the father.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We disagree. The father’s course of conduct during the period in question consistently aimed at maintaining his relationship with his son. The father’s extended attempts to locate his son after his wife left him, to persuade the mother to permit visitation, to send letters and gifts from prison to his son, to arrange for visitation through his new fiancee, along with the other efforts found by the orphans’ court, demonstrate the “reasonable firmness ‘in declining to yield to obstacles . .’” which will preserve parental rights. <em>Adoption of McCray, </em>460 Pa. at 216, <a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">331 A.2d at 655</a>.

In these circumstances, a mere showing that the father could conceivably have pursued legal action more promptly cannot justify termination of the father’s rights.
