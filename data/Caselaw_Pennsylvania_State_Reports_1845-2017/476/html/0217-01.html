Bail was set at $100,000 at 8% plus a $25,000 surety bond. The former was secured by a cash deposit of $8,000 with the clerk of courts; the latter was filed by the Allegheny County Casualty Company.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[209,661,1154,657]]]'>A jury trial began on November 7, 1974. During the trial McDonald failed to appear in court on November 13 and did not appear until the afternoon of November 14. The trial judge, meanwhile, declared his bail forfeited, but directed that the trial continue in his absence. After his return, the jury found him guilty as charged. The court learned that during his absence he had traveled to Detroit, where he had been arrested on other criminal charges. After his conviction in Pennsylvania, the trial court reinstated his bail but directed that the surety bond be increased to $50,000. The Allegheny County Casualty Company filed a second bond in the amount of $25,000, and McDonald was again free on bail.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[210,1345,1153,489]]]'>On April 8, 1975, the Court of Common Pleas granted McDonald a new trial. Previously, however, he had been convicted on an unrelated federal charge, bail pending appeal in that case had been denied, and he had been committed to a federal prison in Indiana. Learning of this, the district attorney of Allegheny County filed a detainer with the federal authorities pursuant to which McDonald was removed to prison in Allegheny County to await his new trial on the Pennsylvania charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court refused to vacate the detainer, and McDonald remained in prison. Subsequently, the two $25,000 surety bonds posted by the Allegheny County Casualty Company were rescinded, and the surety exonerated from its <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>obligations under them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> McDonald then petitioned the court to return to him the $8,000 bail deposit on the ground that he was now in custody and in effect without bail. At a hearing on July 3, 1975, the hearing judge was advised the money was actually put up by McDonald’s family, but the judge declared he wanted “to await the disposition here” and indicated the money would be retained “for safekeeping.” The petition was denied.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[241,744,1155,1050]]]'>On July 9, 1975, the court accepted a plea bargain pursuant to which McDonald pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. He was sentenced to a prison term of six to twelve years, concurrent with his federal sentence, and was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine as well as the costs of prosecution. At this time McDonald's counsel asked the judge to release the $8,000 bail deposit to McDonald’s sisters who, he stated, had provided the money from their own funds. The judge refused to hear the testimony of the sisters, who were present in court, and concluded that the Rules of Criminal Procedure permit fines and costs to be deducted from the bail money no matter who supplies it. Accordingly, he ordered the fine and costs to be deducted from the bail money. This was done, and the balance, $5,058.15, was returned to McDonald. On direct appeal the Superior Court affirmed without opinion the order of July 3, the judgment of sentence, and the order deducting the fine from the bail deposit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We granted McDonald’s petition for allowance of appeal, and this appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b253-7" data-blocks='[["BL_253.8",253,[214,1254,1154,514]]]'>Pa.R.Crim.P. 3(b) defines bail as “the security required and given <em>for the release of a person in the custody of the law, </em>conditioned upon a written undertaking that he will appear when required and do all other things stipulated therein.” [Emphasis added.] Bail is thus put up in exchange for the defendant’s release from custody; it secures his future appearance and other requirements of his bond, but it does not secure the payment of fines and costs which may be imposed upon him in the future. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Truesdale, </em><a href="/pa/449/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="449 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1945661" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0325-01">449 Pa. 325</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20829" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="296 A.2d 829">296 A.2d 829</a> (1972).</p>

Although no forfeiture of the bail had been declared on July 3 — see Pa.R.Crim.P. 4016 — at that time McDonald no longer had the freedom from custody which the money was deposited to secure. Rule 4015(b) authorizes the retention of a sum of money if it constitutes bail. Bail is given for the release of a person. Since bail was, in effect, revoked by the incarceration of McDonald and the release of the surety, the money no longer constituted bail. Accordingly, the court no longer had the authority under Rule 4015(b) to retain the cash deposit until “full and final disposition of the case.” Our conclusion is further supported by Rule 4011 which clearly indicates that revocation of bail invalidates a bond.

Williams, </em><a href="/wash/127/0658-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="127 Wash. 658" data-case-ids="8843398" data-case-paths="/wash/127/0658-01">127 Wash. 658</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20P.%20289" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="221 P. 289">221 P. 289</a> (1923).
