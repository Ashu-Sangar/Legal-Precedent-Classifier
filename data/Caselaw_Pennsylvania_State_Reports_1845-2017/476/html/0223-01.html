In order to establish aggravating circumstances, the Commonwealth called an assistant United States attorney from Washington, D.

Our task is complicated by the fact that no clear majority view with regard to ascertaining the constitutionality of a capital-punishment statute has emerged from these decisions. Justices Brennan and Marshall would have invalidated all five of the statutes at issue in the 1976 cases because of their consistently-expressed view that the death penalty in all circumstances constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist would have found all five constitutional. The decisions of the Court were thus controlled by a “plurality” consisting of Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens which in each case constituted part of the decisional majority with one of these justices writing the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court. The conclusion which emerges from these decisions is that the death penalty as a punishment for murder is not, <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>at least at present, inevitably cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> but that a statute authorizing capital punishment for even a narrowly-limited category of murder violates the Eighth Amendment if it does not sufficiently permit the sentencing authority in determining the sentence to take into account the particular circumstances of the crime and the individual history and character of the criminal.

After a defendant is convicted of capital-murder in Texas, a sentencing proceeding follows during which the jury is required to answer three questions based upon the evidence it has heard. For the death penalty to be imposed, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to each question is yes. One of these questions, which in effect raise the issue of mitigating circumstances, focuses upon the character and record of the defendant. The jury is thereby asked to determine “whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.” In finding the Texas statute constitutional, the plurality strongly emphasized that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals interpreted this question to permit the defendant to present to the jury whatever mitigating evidence he can adduce:</p>

      <em>Furman </em>have yet to congeal to an extent where there is a consensus by a clear majority of Justices as to those factors which must be present to assure compliance with the constitutional standards. Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL have maintained their view that the Federal Constitution prohibits capital punishment for all crimes under all circumstances. Mr. Chief Justice BURGER and Justices BLACKMUN and REHNQUIST, dissenters in <em>Fur-man, </em>have continued to find all of the statutory schemes considered by that Court to comport with their concept of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Mr. Justice WHITE, although concurring in the result in <em>Furman, </em>has since been aligned with the Chief Justice and Justices BLACKMUN and REHNQUIST. Up to this point the constitutionality of a statutory scheme for the imposition of the death sentence has been dependent upon the view of a plurality consisting of Mr. Justices STEWART, POWELL (a dissenter in Furman) and STEVENS. Thus, it is legitimate to conclude that if section 1311 provides a statutory scheme acceptable under the standards articulated by this “plurality” it would more than likely withstand a constitutional challenge in the Federal system.</p>

Act of March 31,1860, P.L. 427, § 73.1.

By improperly focusing upon the clause “at the time of the killing” the majority argues that the section excludes a sufficient consideration of the total character of the accused. The spirit of the Pennsylvania case and statutory law require a different result as the term “lack of maturity” is easily susceptible to a broad interpretation so as to encompass considerations of the defendant’s character and background. The term “maturity” is defined by Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, as having attained the normal peak of natural growth and development.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_17" id="ref_footnote_2_17">16</a> In order to determine what stage of development an individual has reached, there would necessarily have to be an examination of all of the factors influencing the developmental process.

One possible exception noted by the “plurality” appears to be a mandatory death penalty statute limited to an extremely narrow category of homicide such as murder by a prisoner serving a life sentence. <em>See Woodson v.

In <em>Woodson, </em>the “plurality” suggested that where the accused is serving a life sentence at the time of the killing that fact <em>alone </em>might provide sufficient insight as to the character of the offender to meet their concept of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments’ mandate in this regard. <em><a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="201" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="201" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">at 286, n. 7</a>, <a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="202" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">96 S.Ct. 2978</a>.
