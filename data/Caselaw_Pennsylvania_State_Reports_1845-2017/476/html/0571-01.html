Mrs. Jesse Bechter, aged 71, admitted him for the purpose of allowing him to use the telephone and directed him to the kitchen where the telephone was located. Appellant pulled out a gun and demanded money of Mrs. Bechter. He ordered her to lie down on the floor and when she was unable to comply because of physical infirmities resulting from a stroke, he hit her and knocked her to the floor. She was thereafter raped and stabbed by her assailant.</p>

Specifically, it is argued that this jewelry was recovered without a warrant and prior to the arrest of appellant. Further, it is contended that although the jewelry had been turned over to third persons, their custody was limited and that they were not empowered to consent to a police seizure of these articles. A consideration of the facts presented leads us to the conclusion that appellant had relinquished any possessory interest in the property in question and therefore his Fourth Amendment rights were in no way violated by the seizures of these items. Although there are minor discrepancies in the testimony of Hoyt and Rosemary explaining with what intent appellant had given the jewelry to them, it is clear that at least some of the items were relinquished or abandoned. One such item, an earring, was abandoned by appellant in giving it to Rosemary with the instruction to flush it down the toilet. Additionally, appellant had relinquished his interest in some of the stolen rings, evidenced by the fact Hoyt testified he purchased them from appellant. Having abandoned some of the items of jewelry, appellant lost his standing to challenge their seizures. <em>Abel v.

Additionally, appellant argues that he was unduly restricted in the cross-examination of Detective Ziemba, the officer who extracted the latent print. Defense counsel, in the cross-examination of the detective, attempted to elicit from him the fact that the defendant had been brought to the premises and handled the doorjamb in question prior to the detective’s removal of the print. It was clear, however, that the detective did not have personal knowledge of when the defendant actually visited the scene. The court therefore properly prevented trial counsel from attempting to elicit hearsay from this witness. The information as to when the defendant was taken to the scene and the relationship of that visit with the examination by Detective Ziemba was fully established by other witnesses who did in fact have personal knowledge of the event.</p>

Appellee, in his brief, properly notes that appellant could not, at this time, even if he had chosen to do so, raise the question of the admissibility of the fingerprint testimony since that objection had not been properly preserved for review because of the failure to raise it by way of a pre-trial suppression motion. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(b).</p>

It is to be noted that appellant has not expressly requested the exclusion of the fingerprint testimony but rather merely asserts the deprivation of his right against self-incrimination and due process. However, if the challenge was successful it is obvious that in a re-trial, the only way to remedy the complaint would be the suppression of the incriminating evidence which resulted from the asserted illegality.</p>
