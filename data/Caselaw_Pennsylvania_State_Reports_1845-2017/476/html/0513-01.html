Colden remained in office, asserting that his constitutional term lasted until January, 1978, “following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurred].” This Court held that this provision did not apply where the normal election process had begun before the resignation, and reaffirmed this holding in <em>Leedom v.

The method of succession involved in <em>Berardocco </em>— the normal expiration of a regular term, preceded by a primary and election in the “municipal election next preceding” — is precisely the situation to which Section 13(a) addresses itself. <em>Berardocco </em>refused to interpret § 13(b) in a manner that <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>would cause it to interfere with the operation of Section 13(a).</p>

      <em>Firing </em>simply does not call for the result sought by the appellant.

Art. 7, Sections 2 and 3, all “vacancies” that are certain to occur between now and ten months before the municipal election in 1979 are to be filled at the “next preceding municipal election.” Elections would have to be held in 1977, not only for foreseeable vacancies which will occur during 1978, but also for those which will occur in 1979 more than ten months prior to the municipal election of that year. An election will have to be held in 1977 for all judicial offices wherein the incumbent would be mandatorily retired up until ten months before the municipal election in 1979. For example, if one were to reach mandatory retirement age on January 1 of 1979, or in July of 1978, or February 1978, the “next preceding municipal election” would be the municipal election of 1977, just as is the case for mandatory retirements occurring in 1977. The absurdity of this interpretation is obvious: at the municipal election in 1977, the people will be electing judges some of whom will take office in 1978, some of whom will of necessity have to wait until as <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>late -as 1979 to take office.

If, on the other hand, a judge elected at the preceding municipal election is not to begin his term until the first Monday in January, there will be a hiatus during which either the judicial office will remain unfilled or an appointed term less than that provided for in section 13(b) will occur. A person elected might have to continue practicing law for a period of time which could be more than a year after being elected a judge. Such a situation would not be a desirable one. <em>See Reed v. Sloan, </em><a href="/pa/475/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="475 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1734151" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0570-01">475 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="475 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1734151" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0570-01">381 A.2d 421</a> (filed December 1, 1977).</p>

    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[162,612,1151,531]]]'>Filling the vacancies before us under Section 13(b) does not undermine the election rights of the people; the appointment is only for the “initial term” — regular appointed term — of Section 13(b), after which the office would be filled by the elective process of Section 13(a). The majority’s result, premised on the view that the Election Code favors elected officials over appointed ones, ignores the unambiguous provisions of Section 13(b) and consequently perverts the constitutional scheme for filling judicial vacancies. I respectfully dissent.</p>
