    <p id="b355-8" data-blocks='[["BL_355.8",355,[235,784,1149,204]]]'>Appellant, Odell McDuffie, was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of murder in the second degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment was imposed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b355-9" data-blocks='[["BL_355.9",355,[235,1009,1149,309]]]'>Appellant contends that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to strike certain testimony given on cross examination by a prosecution witness. This testimony was to the effect that appellant had previously been convicted of another homicide. We agree and therefore reverse the judgment of sentence and grant a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b355-10" data-blocks='[["BL_355.10",355,[235,1339,1150,470]]]'>The prosecution’s evidence at trial established that during the early evening of June 25, 1973, appellant and one Alvin Jordan confronted the decedent and a companion on the street in Philadelphia. The victim and his companion were sitting on some steps adjacent to the sidewalk when appellant and Jordan pulled up in a car, and, according to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, appellant shot and fatally wounded the decedent as he attempted to escape by running up the street.</p>

Jordan testified that he drove appellant to Christian Street and stopped the car in front of appellant’s house while appellant went inside. Appellant then returned to the car and told Jordan to “go around the comer.” Following appellant’s instructions, Jordan went to 19th Street and Katherine Street where they met a third party, <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>one Fred Simms. Together Jordan, Simms, and appellant drove to Colorado Street and at that point Jordan noticed that appellant had a pistol. Again following appellant’s instructions, Jordan drove down the street and stopped in front of a house where some people were sitting on the steps. Jordan testified that appellant and Simms who were both armed, got out of the car and began “pistol whipping the boys with the guns.” Jordan testified that as the boys attempted to escape by running across and down the street, he saw appellant firing shots. After the shooting appellant and Simms got back in the car and left the scene, Jordan stating that he complied with appellant’s requests to drive away because he was afraid that if he did not comply he would be shot.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[260,1064,1150,779]]]'>During the cross-examination of Jordan, defense counsel sought to establish that Jordan was presently incarcerated as the result of a series of robbery charges having been filed against him, and that he was awaiting disposition on these charges. The defense elicited testimony which indicated that the district attorney’s office had told Jordan that it would recommend a lesser sentence on several of these open robbery indictments in exchange for Jordan’s testimony in this case against the appellant. In the course of this cross-examination, Jordan responded to one of defense counsel’s questions by mentioning that appellant had received probation for a prior homicide in which appellant was involved. Such a reference to appellant’s prior criminal conduct is highly prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth v.

What Jordan said was that appellant “beat or got a probation of a homicide later on.” It is not semantic quibbling to emphasize that the import and seriousness of the two versions are not the same. At best, the admitted remark indicates that appellant had <em>not </em>been convicted of a previous homicide; at worst, that appellant had received probation, presumably pursuant to the acceptance of some sort of guilty plea.</p>

While I concede that a better response on the part of the trial judge would have been to strike the testimony and give cautionary instructions concerning it, I cannot agree that the degree of prejudice to appellant is so severe as to warrant reversal. Viewing the record as a whole, I find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth v. Stanton Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a>.</p>

      <p id="b361-12" data-blocks='[["BL_361.12",361,[216,2010,1149,349]]]'> The cross-examination of the witness Jordan, up through the point of the challenged exchange, occupies a scant twelve pages [N.T. to ] out of a trial transcript of some 739 pages reflecting four days of trial. In those twelve pages of cross-examination, the record shows, the trial judge three times requested that defense counsel keep her questions “to the point” and cease interrupting the answers of the witness. Furthermore, the trial judge also three times stated his belief that the witness was, in fact, attempting to answer counsel’s questions.</p>
