Although the parties have concentrated on section 301(d)(v) which tells us what is <em>not </em>compensation — ^“payments to reimburse actual expenses” — we must, of course, look to those parts of the Code which tell us what <em>is </em>compensation. Both section 301(d), the definition section of the Code, and section 303(a)(1), which specifies the classes of income to be taxed, state that compensation is something which is <em>received for services rendered. </em>The husband’s contract with his employer recognized that he would incur <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>expenses in the pursuit of his employment. These expenses appellant would pay. Moreover, appellee does not dispute that the business expenses of the husband were legitimately incurred by him. Can it realistically be said, that all of the payments received by the husband were received for <em>services rendered </em>? We think that one could reasonably answer “No.” More realistically, the parties contemplated that the husband would retain some of the payments received for his <em>services </em>and use a certain portion of the payments for business expenses. It would be unrealistic to conclude in such an arrangement that the bargained for commission percentages did not recognize that the employee would use some of the payments for business expenses.</p>

That interpretation, however, contradicts section 303, which limits compensation to payments received for <em>services rendered. </em>Presented with this ambiguity, we believe the matter must be resolved in favor of the appellants, otherwise an unconstitutional discrimination between taxpayers similarly situated would result.</p>

The net income from the operation of a business, profession, or other activity, <em>after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, </em>determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with accepted accounting principles and practices but without deduction of taxes based on income.” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>

Nevertheless, it can be seen from this Section that the exclusion of <em>all </em>legitimate business expenses in certain cases was acceptable to the General Assembly. Thus, our conclusion that all legitimate business expenses are excludable from compensation pursuant to Section 301(d)(v) is not an approach foreign to the Code.</p>
