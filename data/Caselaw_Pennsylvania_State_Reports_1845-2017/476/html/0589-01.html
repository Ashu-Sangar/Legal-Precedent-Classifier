While Pennsylvania’s unemployment compensation law does not allow for benefits to be paid to strikers, nevertheless, Sun Oil maintains that a lockout is just as much a weapon or technique in a labor dispute as a strike and that the payment of unemployment benefits to locked out employees restricts the employer’s right to use lockouts in labor disputes. Such a result allegedly interferes with the general regulatory scheme for labor disputes provided by federal labor legislation. Therefore, Sun Oil argues that the state legislation is void due to federal preemption.</p>

However, we believe that recent federal court decisions are dispositive of this issue. <em>Kimbell Inc. v.

A state trial court held this law invalid for reasons similar to those advanced herein, but the New Mexico Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the further appeal for want of a substantial federal question. About the same time that <em>Kimbell </em>was proceeding <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>through the courts, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Super Tire Engineering Co. v.

In that case an employer sought a declaratory judgment that a New Jersey law according unemployment benefits to striking workers was invalid. By the time the district court’s dismissal of the employer’s action reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the labor dispute had been settled, and the Court of Appeals dismissed the action for mootness. The United States Supreme Court considered only the issue of mootness and reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for further action. On remand, the Third Circuit had before it the Supreme Court’s disposition in the <em>Kimbell </em>case, and concluded that the Court’s action in <em>Kim-bell </em>was controlling on the preemption issue and affirmed the dismissal of the district court. <em>Super Tire Engineering Co. v.

The parties had a difference of opinion as to what constituted, under the circumstances, a fair period of time for expiration and notice of termination or strike. Finally, the contract was extended on a day to day basis as long as negotiations were in progress. However, after some five weeks with little progress in negotiations, Sun Oil advised the union that it would terminate the day to day extension agreement on February 17 and if an agreement were not reached by that time, it would implement some of its contract proposals. Sun Oil and the union had several meetings regarding implementation of proposals, the last of which meetings occurred on March 14, 1973. At this time Sun Oil, having previously implemented certain proposals, advised that it intended to implement additional provisions on March 25,1973. The next day, March 15, 1973, the union executive board adopted a resolution to conduct a strike vote among the membership on Sunday, March 18,1973, at which time the membership voted to strike. Sun Oil points out that at midnight March 14, 1973, refinery workers at its Toledo, Ohio plant went out on strike, having rejected a wage offer which the union in the present case considered far superior to any offer that had been made to it. Sun Oil suggests that the events in Toledo were the motivating factor in the strike involved in this case. To counter this suggestion, the union’s president and chief negotiator testified before the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review that there was dissatisfaction on the part of the union with some of the changes to be implemented, and that the union objected to putting more individual proposals into effect absent a complete collective bargaining agreement. <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>Sun Oil’s theory is that if the union strike was motivated by the events in Toledo rather than by Sun Oil’s unilateral implementation of contract proposals, then the work stoppage was a strike, not a lockout. In effect, Sun Oil is asking this Court to adopt a rule requiring a claimant to prove that a union work stoppage was motivated <em>solely </em>by the employer’s failure to maintain the status quo. This we decline to do. Such a rule would compel the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and the Commonwealth Court to fathom underlying, subjective motivations for a work stoppage and would thus undermine the clarity and relative predictability embodied in the standard set forth in our <em>Vrotney </em>and <em>Philco Corp. </em>decisions. Additionally, the rule of <em>Vrotney </em>and <em>Philco Corp. </em>tends to encourage employers and employees alike to maintain the status quo while negotiating a new agreement. The departure from this rule, urged by Sun Oil, would weaken this salutary effect.</p>
