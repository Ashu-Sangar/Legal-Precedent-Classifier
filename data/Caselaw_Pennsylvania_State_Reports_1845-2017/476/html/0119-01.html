We must therefore read the statutory reference to “calendar” and “fiscal” years so that it reaches a reasonable result in light of business accounting and operating practices. The 1969 amendments specify the time at which the 12% tax rate was to become effective, depending on whether a corporation used a calendar or fiscal year method of accounting. In 1969, Fisher Governor operated on a calendar year basis— that is, it began calculating the year’s income and expenses on January 1, as it had done in previous years. On August 12, 1969, Fisher Governor ceased doing business, and there<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>fore its 1969 tax period was not a full calendar year. But this occurrence does not change the fact that, while in business, Fisher Governor was accounting on a calendar year basis. Accordingly, for these tax purposes, Fisher Governor was a calendar year taxpayer in 1969. We therefore reject appellant’s first contention.</p>

Even if true this incident alone would not prove discrimination against Fisher Governor.

The appellant taxpayer had sold all of its assets and had ceased doing business several months before the adoption of the new law raising the tax rate. The new law can not properly tax what for practical purposes was a nonexistent taxpayer. Other corporate taxpayers which went out of business in 1969 and were thus also nonexistent on the day of the adoption of the new tax were required to pay only the lower rate solely because they filed a return earlier than the appellant. The filing date difference does not justify a different tax treatment. The new law increasing the tax rate was inapplicable to the appellant.</p>
