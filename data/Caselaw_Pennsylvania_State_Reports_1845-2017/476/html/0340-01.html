In these appeals, appellant contends that the closing argument of the prosecuting attorney was prejudicial and the instruction to the jury on felony-murder was erroneous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant has failed, however, to raise either issue in post-verdict motions and therefore these claims have not been properly preserved for appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Margaret Handerahan testified that at approximately 3:00 a. m., she woke up, finding a hand covering her mouth and a knife at <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>her throat. The man holding the knife and three of his companions led Handerahan from the car to a wooded area nearby, where she was raped by each of the men. The men left her lying in the wooded area and, a few minutes later, Handerahan heard a car drive away.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[212,593,1151,310]]]'>Handerahan testified that as she was led to the wooded area, she saw two other men holding Wolf.

    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[208,1209,1153,795]]]'>Juan Garcia, a participant in the crimes, testified that he and five companions, including appellant, approached the car in which the victims were sleeping. According to Garcia, appellant said, “Let’s see if we can get some money.” As two of the men opened the door and pulled out Wolf, appellant held a knife to Handerahan’s throat and let her out of the car. Garcia testified that he accompanied appellant and the others to the wooded area, and that appellant was the first to rape Handerahan. Garcia testified that he too raped Handerahan and then returned to the vicinity of the pool, where he heard water splashing. Upon arriving at the pool Garcia stated that he observed appellant in the pool holding Wolf around the head and two others holding Wolf’s legs and arms. Garcia stated that at first Wolf resisted but eventually Wolf lay floating in the pool face down.</p>

The evidence here was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant killed Kevin Wolf willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation. The testimony of Juan Garcia placed appellant at the scene of the crime, and established that as a result of appellant’s conduct Wolf was motionless, face down, in a pool of water. The jury was thus presented with testimony of an eyewitness which, if believed, would establish beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the crime of murder of the first degree. The evidence was thus sufficient for the jury to render its verdict.</p>
