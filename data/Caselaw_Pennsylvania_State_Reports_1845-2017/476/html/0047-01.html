Taking the last point first, it comes immediately to mind that, the claim of the Company is that it is in the class of “a butcher, baker or candlestick maker” so that its charges could not be publicly regulated.

An arbitration award required the city to pay premiums for families of employees. This Court held that the award was not enforceable because the exercise of power called for was unauthorized by enabling legislation, despite the presence of a catch-all provision in the city code, substantively identical to that of the Borough Code.

The same result was reached in <em>Genkinger v.

Here, however, the regulation of rates of a commercial enterprise is not reasonably deducible from any of the specific powers granted to the Borough in the Borough Code.
