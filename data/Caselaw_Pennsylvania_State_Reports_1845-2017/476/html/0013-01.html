Barsky appealed the administrative determination imposing the assessment to the Commonwealth Court under 72 P.S. § 7255. The Commonwealth Court ordered appellant to file an additional $200,000 bond as a condition of prosecuting the appeal, relying upon the Fiscal Code, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 343, § 1104(b), as amended, 72 P.S. § 1104(b).

    <p id="b49-7" data-blocks='[["BL_49.8",49,[192,1036,1150,677]]]'>Moreover a $579,000 lien against the assets of a small business hinders that business in obtaining a further security bond. To require such a bond would allow the Commonwealth to be doubly secured — by the lien and by the bond— as a condition to appeal, even though the Commonwealth can collect only on the lien if no appeal ensues. The Commonwealth should not be required to delay collection on its lien while appeal is pending unless the taxpayer puts up security in the form of a bond. On the other hand, if there is no supersedeas and the Commonwealth’s power to collect on the lien is not interfered with, there is no reason to impose any additional burden on a taxpayer as a condition to exercising the right to appeal.</p>

However, the parties appeared to assume that failure to meet the bond requirement would result in dismissal, and did not present the question to us squarely. The Eagles argued that <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>in the particular circumstances of its case, the bond requirement had been met; we did not consider the argument that the bond should act as a supersedeas only and not act as a condition of appeal. Furthermore, the opinion does not state whether the Commonwealth had filed a lien against the Eagles for the tax it claimed, as it has in the instant case.</p>

That section deals with the timing of tax collection while a controversy is pending before administrative tribunals, or where no appeal is taken from the administrative agency to the courts. When review is sought in the courts, the time of tax collection will be based upon other considerations — in particular the rules governing supersedeas.</p>

Barsky raises before us three constitutional issues which we need not decide: (1) a claim that 72 P.S. § 1104 denies it a right to appeal, see Pa.Const. art. V, § 9; (2) a claim that the bond procedure allows the Commonwealth to take property — the disputed assessment— without due process of law; (3) a claim that the bond requirement <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>violates equal protection. Our disposition of this case upon statutory grounds satisfies the first two of Barsky’s constitutional objections. The third issue was not raised in Barsky’s petition for nominal bond in the Commonwealth Court and is waived. Such an objection to a statute is not preserved simply because another challenge to it is made. See <em>Kimmel v.
