    <blockquote id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[302,491,1107,829]]]'>Reasoning from these facts, the Board concluded that “[t]he record reveals that the claimant believed the truck he was operating was unsafe and so informed his employer. The employer offered to have the truck repaired; and because the claimant did not agree with the employer as to who would repair the truck, he advised the employer that he would no longer operate the truck. Claimant was discharged for failing to perform the duties of the job with the equipment that was available to him. Since the claimant had no way of knowing what the condition of the truck would be after the repairs, his action in informing the employer that he would not operate the truck constitutes willful misconduct connected with the work. Therefore, the claimant must be disqualified from receiving benefits under the provisions of Section 402(e) of the Law.”</blockquote>

They have been established in the record by appellant himself — the only person who testified. The reasoning and conclusions based upon these facts, however, ignore the dictates of <em>Frumento </em>that the reasonableness of the employer’s request and good cause for the employee’s actions be evaluated in light of <em>all </em>the attendant circumstances.

The employer had no right to expect an employee to rely upon a repair service which had twice failed in making repairs essential to safe operation; hence, the employee did not disregard a reasonable employer’s request.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.6",655,[184,1015,1150,991]]]'>The Commonwealth Court held that, by refusing to drive a truck repaired by CNS appellant was in effect substituting his judgment for that of the employer. It was the employer, however, who on the first day requested that appellant inspect the truck for defects, apparently accepted appellant’s findings, and sent the truck to CNS for repairs. After repairs the employer asked appellant to test-drive the truck for one day to see if it was operational, and when appellant said that the vehicle was unsafe, the employer again proposed to have it repaired. In effect, then, the employer specifically asked for appellant’s judgment on the truck’s condition, and relied upon it. The employer knew, and was aware that appellant knew, that CNS’s repairs had been inadequate and that CNS had released an allegedly repaired truck in a dangerously defective condition. Appellant was not unreasonably insisting upon his own conditions of employment by refusing to risk his life once more on yet another potentially unreliable repair job.</p>
