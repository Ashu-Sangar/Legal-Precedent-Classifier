The contractor got into financial trouble; many of his subcontractors had not been paid and some threatened to stop work, among them appellants. The priest of the parish for which the church was being erected then told appellants that there was plenty of money to pay if they continued work, and appellants later received a check from Cardinal Dougherty’s office. It. was payable to the Woodland Construction Company <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>and endorsed by it Appellants, having completed their work, and not being paid, instituted action therefor against the cardinal, as trustee.</p>

It was held the evidence was insufficient to establish agency, and recovery was denied. ■</p>

It must be understood that ecclesiastical relationship of itself does not in any sense set up a contract or legal relation on which to base liability for acts of one for the other. In the contract the cardinal guarded him<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>self and his people by placing in the hands of an architect supervision of the construction according to the plans and specifications as interpreted by him.

Agency will not be assumed from the mere fact that one does an act for another. The fact of agency must be established. Some legal connection must appear from which the alleged principal could not escape the conclusion of delegated authority or agency. This may be shown by notice or actual knowledge, without disavowal, of the repeated acts or course of conduct of the one assuming to act as agent toward an identified person. It must be remembered <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>that what is here attempted is to create a color of agency as to the agreement on which suit is brought; it is not a real agency as is one under express or implied authority.</p>

Ordinarily the priest would be interested, as any other member of the congregation would be, but, unless specifically authorized, he cannot presume to act for the bishop. The acts of the priest enumerated above, and others not mentioned, would be of no more effect than similar ones of an inspector or overseer endeavoring and anxious successfully to complete the building. All of these acts committed on the work would not show or tend to show knowledge, either express or implied, nor would they show authority to make or modify a contract: Kelly Construction Co. v.

Appellee did not live at the place where the church was being erected, but in a different county. The bishop was not required to use diligence to discover or refute some floating rumor, gossip, or even general repute as to the actions or representations of the priest. No law requires it: Anfenson v. Banks, <a href="/iowa/180/1066-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="180 Iowa 1066" data-case-ids="2239366" data-case-paths="/iowa/180/1066-01">180 Iowa 1066</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20N.W.%20608" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="163 N.W. 608">163 N.

Whom or what would he ask? Whom would he warn? No man is responsible for rumors concerning himself or his business unless through his own, conduct he has given rise thereto, or their existence has been brought to his attention in such manner that in good conscience he should deny them. If one were legally bound to inquire what others were saying about him or about his business, there would be little time for anything else. It is only where knowl<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>edge is brought home that some identified person is about to be injured that even a denial is necessary; but here this is not so and there was committed, in writing, to competent hands, the scope, nature and character of the work and its proper supervision. Any person building a house under similar circumstances might not know or learn what an inspector or supervisor had done in connection with the construction. If authority could arise by estoppel under the circumstances here predicated, it would lead to all manner of fraud and imposition on the owner. To effect an estoppel for appellants, it should appear that they were not only influenced by the conduct and declarations of the priest to their injury, but that they were destitute of knowledge of the true state of facts, and had no convenient means of acquiring such knowledge. The contract was in writing and filed in the prothonotary’s office. They knew, or should have known, that the bishop or cardinal was the one to be relied on. They should not have reposed confidence entirely in the priest, but should have inquired at the main source of authority. Reliance must rest on some reasonable basis. We agree with the court below that the evidence was entirely insufficient to establish agency by estoppel or apparent authority.</p>

The architect had no authority to increase the liability of the owners; his connection with the contract is fixed by the writing, — to pass upon the sufficiency of the work, labor and material, to determine the right of the contractor to receive payment, to interpret the plans and specifications, and such other powers as are specifically given to <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>Mm by the contract. It would be indeed a very dangerous doctrine to hold that an architect erecting a building according to plans and specifications, could, on his general powers of supervision and interpretation, construct a building twice as large, or rewrite the entire contract. Nor would the priest’s or architect’s conversation with Bolger, another subcontractor, stating that the balance of the money would come from the cardinal’s office, be sufficient. Such declaration, even of an agent, is not admissible, it does not establish a promise to appellants themselves: Roberts v.
