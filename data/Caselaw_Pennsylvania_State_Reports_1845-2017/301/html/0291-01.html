Requests Avere made, in September, 1925, by the proper city authorities, to the company to make such necessary relocations, and in December the city served written notice on the company “to remove said conduits and appurtenant facilities, so as to permit the execution of the city’s project.” In reply, the company denied the right of the municipality to compel relocation of the conduits, “at the cost and expense of the company,” and assumed “the position......that the encroachment upon its rights heretofore granted, to construct and maintain these conduits, for purposes of subway construction, without proceeding according to law, <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>and providing compensation to this company for the loss and expense thereby occasioned, imposes a liability on the city for such loss and expense”; however to avoid interruption of its service to customers, “this company has performed the work under protest, and will hold the city responsible for the cost and expense to which it has thus been improperly and unlawfully subjected.” The city having denied liability, the company sued in trespass, to determine the question whether or not plaintiff was obliged to remove and relay the conduits in question at its own expense. By agreement of the parties, the case was tried without a jury. The court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, holding the municipality liable and entered judgment against it for the sum of $6,261.66. Exceptions to the findings were dismissed and final judgment entered for the amount of the claim, with interest. This appeal by the city is from the judgment so entered.</p>

At the time the charter of plaintiff company was granted in 1902, there was in existence and in full force and effect an ordinance adopted by council in 1886, providing, among other things, that “every company, corporation, etc., desiring to lay and construct a line or lines of telegraph,......electric light wires ......conduits......under any of the streets of the city shall first file with the board of highway supervisors an application in writing, accompanied by a general plan and specification, showing the location of the proposed work”; and that the laying, construction and maintenance of all wires, conduits, etc., shall be under the rules and regulations of the board of highway supervisors. In 1906, four years before the company’s entry and use of the streets and its first application for permission to do so, definite rules and regulations were adopted and continued in force by the board of highway supervisors, “governing applications for the laying of electrical conduits, tubes and manholes”; wherein, section 2 stipulated that, “Before any street surface shall be broken, or a permit be issued (except as hereinafter provided), the following rules and regulations, and such additional rules and regulations as the board of highway super<a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>visors may from time to time adopt, shall be binding on the applicant or applicants”; that “any modification of existing structures found to be necessary must be made by or under the direction of the bureau concerned and at the expense of the party having the permit”; and it was further provided in section 12, “If, in the laying of water or gas pipes, sewers, or any other municipal work, it shall become necessary to change the location of any of the conduits, manholes, or other structures, they shall be shifted or altered at the cost or expense of the owners, to such places as shall be directed by the board of highway supervisors.”</p>
    <p id="b321-3" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[129,997,1152,1347]]]'>Subsequent to the incorporation of plaintiff company, the city council adopted a “consenting ordinance,” granting permission to plaintiff to enter upon and use the streets of Philadelphia and the construction and operation, among other things, of underground conduits. The ordinance also provided that “the board of highway supervisors shall locate said conduits, wires ......and all such work shall be done under the direction of the electrical bureau of the department of public safety”; and it further required from the company a bond in the sum of $50,000, “conditioned that the company shall faithfully comply with the provisions of this ordinance, as well as other ordinances, regulating the construction, maintenance and extension of electrical conduits, poles, wires, and lines and license charges thereon, in the City of Philadelphia.” Following the enactment of the above mentioned ordinance, the company furnished the required bond, in which was recited all provisions of the consenting ordinance of 1902, and the further obligation that “the said company shall and will fully and faithfully comply with all the provisions” of the ordinance of 1902, “as well as all other ordinances of council of said city regulating the construction, maintenance and extension of electrical conduits,......in the City of Philadelphia.”</p>

      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>Plaintiff filed its written acceptance, obligating it “to accept and agree to be governed by the ordinances of councils, and the rules and regulations of the board of highway supervisors and such additional rules and regulations as the board shall hereafter make.” Plaintiff company made written applications in 1901, 1914 and 1916 for permission to open streets and lay conduits. To one of the applications, that of 1914, and presumably to all, were annexed plaintiff’s formal acceptance of the ordinances and rules and regulations mentioned above.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[283,885,1155,1501]],["BL_323.1",323,[133,346,1152,2054]],["BL_324.1",324,[294,343,1150,962]]]'>The right of plaintiff to enter upon Broad Street and lay its conduits beneath the surface rests, accordingly, upon contract, subject however to the police power of the city and its rights under its charter which continued its full control and supervisions over all its thoroughfares. The chief sphere of the action of the police power, being a function of government, concerns immediately a restriction on the use of property or the conduct of persons that may be detrimental to public health, morals or safety: White’s App., <a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>, 263. We need not go further than to say, in relation to the nature of this contract, that it was a contract for service; and the contractual conditions imposed by the city, which plaintiff could either accept or reject, were impositions certainly within the scope of its municipal powers. The record of the case discloses that the company had every opportunity to know, in detail, before its formal acceptance, all requirements exacted by the city and the evidence indicates its familiarity with all prerequisites imposed by the city. Consequently, when plaintiff seeks to repudiate the contractual requirement that “if, in the laying of water or gas pipes, or sewers, <em>or any other municipal </em>work, it shall become necessary to change the location of any conduits, manholes, or other structures, they shall be shifted and altered at the cost or expenses of the owners, and relaid at such places as shall be directed by the board of highway supervisors,” it unquestionably can therein find no just grounds for repudiation. When <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>the occasion arose and necessity required the moving and replacing of the conduits, and plaintiff, in the face of its contract with the municipality, refused to comply with the city’s request, a situation was created threatening the convenience and safety of the people and one which the city could meet only by exercising its rights in behalf of the public welfare in requiring the obstructing conduits to be shifted. The city, however, was mindful of the rights of the company when it set forth the stipulation as to shifting and replacing. No such work could be performed at the expense of plaintiff except when “it shall become necessary.” The city had entered upon the construction, at great expense, of a most extensive subway improvement in one of its prominent thoroughfares. In the course of construction of this municipal enterprise it was found that conduits of plaintiff, as then located, hindered and prevented the proper completion of the project, intended for public use. The shifting and relaying of the structures was <em>k </em>matter of pressing and immediate public concern. Hindrance and delay in the construction by reason of the location of plaintiff’s property meant not only increased cost to the city, but also a serious public inconvenience and that such continued incompletion, or an improper completion, would unquestionably amount to nothing less than jeopardy to public safety. Before these imposing public necessities, private rights may not stand as a barrier; and in the present instance the conduits were subject to the regulatory control of the municipality under its police power (Springfield Con. Water Co. v. Phila.,. <a href="/pa/285/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="285 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1095106" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0172-01">285 Pa. 172</a>,175; Pittsburgh v.

Superior Ct. 374</a>) and by its acceptance of the provisions of the ordinances and rules and regulations governing its right to enter upon and use the streets, plaintiff was obligated to defray the cost of moving and relaying its conduits and other property in accordance with the principle set forth in many declarations of this court: Allegheny v.

L. 520, by which authority was given the municipality of Philadelphia, as a city of the first class, to construct the subway in question here. An examination of that act reveals that it does not apply to and therefore does not control the present dispute. The act provides that a city of the first class may “purchase, lease, locate, construct and equip, or otherwise acquire, transit facilities, and to own......and operate the same.” By the provisions of section 6 the municipality is empowered to resort to the exercise of the right of eminent domain to acquire such private property, “as shall be necessary,” and the payment of compensatory damages. But the learned court below quite misconstrues the meaning and <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>intent of the act, with reference to the present controversy, in saying: “The Act of 1913, under which the defendant is. constructing the underground railway, to make way for which its officers caused the shifting of the plaintiff’s conduits, provides for the assessment of damages for property taken thereunder, and thus indicated that the taking of such property is not by virtue of the police power.” In the case before us there was no taking or appropriating of property. The conduits were not removed from Broad Street by the city, nor destroyed or demolished. In their original position they rested upon property of the municipality, in which the company had no proprietary rights or interests whatever. They were merely shifted to another and near-by location in the same street and remained upon the city’s property. It is true, the Act of 1913 makes specific provisions with reference to the removal and relocation of underground conduits, of the character here in question. The provisions apply to a situation entirely different from that which exists here. Section 6 of the act sets forth in terms the exact purposes for which the city shall exercise its right of eminent domain. It may take and appropriate, under that right, lands for the construction and operation of transit facilities, such as may be necessary for the relocation of existing railway tracks and for the removal and relocation of “any pipes, sewers, underground conduits, when such things interfere with the construction and operation of the facilities of transit”; and “including also, such lands and rights and interests therein, as shall be necessary for the purpose of disposing of earth, stone, or other material excavated in the construction of such transit facilities.” That is to say, when private property for the designated various purposes is required it may be taken by right of eminent domain. But what land, other than already owned by the municipality, was needed here for the relocation of plaintiff’s conduits? Upon what other property were they to be shifted and relaid? Certainly not upon any <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>additional land purchased, or acquired in any manner, or to be so purchased or acquired, by the city. The appliances in their original position rested upon municipal property; when shifted and relaid they still remained on city property. Subject to the paramount authority of the Commonwealth, the regulation and control of the streets, which are the great highways of the city, belong to the city government (Southwark R. R. Co. v.

The precise question here involved was met in the case of New Orleans Gas Light Co. v. Drainage Commission of New Orleans, <a href="/us/197/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="197 U.S. 453" data-case-ids="3636188" data-case-paths="/us/197/0453-01">197 U. S. 453</a>. The gas company was given the exclusive privilege to supply gas to the city and laid underground pipes and conduits in the streets. Later the municipality adopted a general system of drainage, and in the construction of the scheme found it necessary to remove and change the location of the gas conduits and pipes. The company claimed an arbitrary taking by the city, without just compensation. The court in denying the claim of the corporation, so clearly sets forth the legal principles which governed there, and equally control here, that we may quote and adopt them as stated: “There is nothing in the grant of the privilege which gave the company the right to any particular location in the streets; it had the right to use the streets, or such of them as it might require, in the prosecution of its business...... Except that the privilege was conferred to use the streets in laying the pipes in some places thereunder, there was nothing in the terms of the grant to indicate the intention of the State to give up its control of the public streets, certainly not so far as such power might be required by proper regulations to con<a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>trol their use for legitimate purposes connected with the public health and safety...... The gas company by its grant from the city acquired no exclusive right to the location of its pipes in the streets as chosen by it, under a general grant of authority to use the streets. The city made no contract that the gas company should not be disturbed in the locations therein.” In Keystone Telephone Co. v. P. &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa-super/56/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="56 Pa. Super. 384" data-case-ids="441995" data-case-paths="/pa-super/56/0384-01">56 Pa. Superior Ct. 384</a>, the stipulation involved in the present case whereby the plaintiff here was required, and agreed, to shift and relay its conduits under Broad Street at its own expense, was considered. In that case the City of Philadelphia changed the street grade to enable the tracks of a railroad company to be elevated, which necessitated a relocation of the telephone company’s underground conduits. In affirming the judgment of the court below for the city, the appellate court said: “The shifting of the conduits was decided upon by the city authorities, and these were removed and replaced under the direction and supervision of the board of highway supervisors of the city...... The resultant changes were necessary to enable the telephone company to continue its business, and these were reasonably in contemplation, by the provisions that they shall be shifted and altered at the expense of the owners, to such places as shall be directed.”</p>

Though not material, the local traction company has been operating the subway since its completion. When the city began the work of building the subway, various public service companies were already in Broad Street, engaged in the business of selling their product or the use of their facilities to the public. Among these were the electric company (the appellees), which supplies light to the city and its people, telephone companies, and others. One of appellee’s main trunk lines was located in Broad Street and from it other lines extended into other intersecting highways. Acting under the above mentioned Act of 1913 and ordinance of 1924, the city directed these operations to be removed from their existing locations to make way for the subway. The eom<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>pany protested the removal order, which involved the destruction of extensive sections of its conduit system without being compensated for the expense connected with it; later, by arrangement and to avoid delaying the work, the conduits were demolished by the city’s contractor and subsequently removed and rebuilt by the electric company at its own expense.

In 1902, the electric company requested the city to grant its consent to their occupation of the streets of Philadelphia; this franchise was granted in the ordinance of 1902 with the stipulation that a bond should be furnished conditioned for the compliance with that ordinance and all “other ordinances regulating the construction, maintenance and extension of electrical conduits.” The provisions of the ordinance of 1886, consistent with that of 1902, formed a part of appellee’s rights and obligations. That latter ordinance regulated the manner and method under which companies, securing the city’s consent, could enter its highways by placing in them their conduits, pipe lines, and like equipment. Section 4 of the 1886 ordinance reads: “The laying, construction and maintenance of all......conduits......shall be under the supervision of......the electrical department...... and <em>shall be laid </em>under the rules and regulations of the Board of Highway Supervisors.” That board was created and their duties defined by the ordinance of 1884 for the purpose of preventing frequent and unnecessary opening of street pavements.

It was not simply of a privilege to maintain pipes actually laid, but to lay pipes so far as they might be required in order to effect an adequate distribution. The privilege was defined as that ‘of using the public streets and thoroughfares thereof, and of laying down pipes and conduits therein, and connections therewith, so far as may be necessary for introducing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants either with gas light, or other illuminating light, or with fresh water for domestic and all other purposes, upon the condition that the municipal government shall have the right to regulate the charges thereof.’ ”</p>

The city at the time of the adoption of section 12 in 1906, or prior thereto, did not have the power to engage in building subways, nor could it move the conduits for that purpose. The effect of the term used in section 12 must be related to, and limited by, the character of work contemplated by these enabling ordinances of 1884, 1886 and 1902. Section 12 states that in the “laying of......other municipal work” the utility must shift to some other place as directed by the board. This must be read in connection with section 5, which requires that a utility already occupying a city street shall be compensated when the shift is made for the benefit of another utility. It is the clear intent of the regulations taken as a whole that as between utility enterprises, priority of position in the streets should carry with it priority of right, and that any expenses incidental to the entrance into the streets of a later utility project, should be borne by that project rather than imposed upon prior occupants. This principle should be borne in mind in interpreting the phrase “municipal work” as used in section 12, and since under that section the cost of making way for municipal projects is imposed upon the occupants of the street for the benefit of the municipality without regard to priority, in order to make this section consistent with the earlier section and with the general scheme of responsibility <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>contemplated by the regulations, it must be interpreted to apply to strictly governmental activities of the municipality, as distinguished from its private or proprietary enterprises. Then section 12 must be interpreted as being authorized and limited by the ordinance relating to the “time” and “manner” of “opening” streets. An ordinance authorizing an underground railway to be built can scarcely be considered as one referring to the time, manner and method of placing a conduit or as “laying a municipal work,” even if it be considered as municipal work. The city did not so regard it since it proceeded under the ordinance of 1924 to attempt revocation of appellee’s permits. That ordinance is provided for the building of an underground electric railway, a business venture, and, as incidental to the building, took hold of plaintiff’s conduits and, in effect, destroyed them. It compelled the electric company to build new conduits and relay them in a new location, — clearly a matter not authorized either by the ordinances of 1886 and 1902 or section 12. No one of them contemplated a situation like the present, permitting one business corporation to force, without compensation, another business corporation to remove and rebuild its equipment for the benefit of a newcomer in the field.</p>

But such paper could not and did not affect the substantive right granted by the city, — in fact, no authority from the company, authorizing such release is pleaded, and, further, such acceptance should be limited, as stated above, by the powers of the board and the ordinary work to which the rule, section 12, related and to reasonable regulations as authorized by the ordinances of 1884, 1886 and 1902. It may be seriously doubted whether, even with the corporate sanction, a charter right could be contracted away, without consideration, in this manner.</p>
