In 1920, oil was discovered on an adjoining property and drilling operations were begun. The same year defendant took several leases on adjacent land, and acquired also the right to enter on the plaintiffs’ farm, and did construct the well known as Aronson No. 1. During the three years succeeding, several others were opened in close proximity by different prospectors, one within 200 feet of the Schlichtkrull home, and some across an inter<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>vening stream, of about the same level as the well in question, and into which waste water found its way, but on the opposite slope. In 1922, after the first Aronson drilling, salt appeared in the well water, but, after complaint, and the installation of proper drainage, this condition was corrected. During the summer of 1925, the defendant caused a second boring to be made, 988 feet from the house, and with which we are concerned in the present proceeding. It was driven through the bluff or fresh sand some 80 feet from the surface, but as no water then appeared, it was continued to a much lower depth, without the insertion of any casing, as some witnesses testified was customarily done to prevent the salt water, —reached at lower levels, — coming in contact with the fresh, which passed through the strata above. In failing to so protect from possible contamination, the jury has found on disputed testimony that defendant failed to exercise due care.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[279,1322,1155,1065]]]'>In 1926 the well water became salty and bitter, and so continued until the time of bringing this suit. It was claimed that a permanent injury to the land resulted, for which loss damages were asked. An expert for plaintiffs, by the use of a violet dye inserted at the point of drilling, disclosed some connection between the salty water there present and the contents of the well, though differing in other chemical contents, as shown by an analysis, and the jury was justified in finding that the water passed in some way through the ground from one point to the other. Other wells on the farther slope also produced salt water, as in the case of the one located on the Utes property on the opposite side of the stream. No connection between them and the house water supply appeared from the evidence produced. The operation last mentioned had been in use for 20 years, during part of which time at least the water of plaintiffs was in good condition, not having become again polluted until 1922, and later in 1926, after the Aronson No. 2 was drilled.</p>

Chartiers V. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/131/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="131 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="810304" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0143-01">131 Pa. 143</a>, 160, s. c. <a href="/pa/139/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="139 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="11250654" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0111-01">139 Pa. 111</a>. In this case, the earlier decisions are discussed, and the rule stated thus: “[If] there is evidence from which the jury could fairly find that the defendant, when the well was drilled, knew, or ought to have known, if [it] had exercised any reasonable judgment, or investigated or paid attention to it, that the boring of this well in the way it was done, without shutting off the salt water from the fresh water, would almost inevitably ruin these and other wells in the immediate vicinity [damages may be recovered]. And I think there is evidence from which the jury could fairly find that the defendant could, with the outlay of a small amount of money, have shut off the salt water from the fresh water so that it could not have done any injury...... If the plaintiff showed that the injury was plainly to be anticipated, and easily preventable with reasonable care and expense, he brought himself within the exception of all the cases.” See also Pfeiffer v. Brown, <a href="/pa/165/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="165 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="862076" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0267-01">165 Pa. 267</a>.

In the statement of claim, a permanent injury to the land was asserted and not denied in the affidavit of defense, though this averment was not required in such a pleading. The case was tried, without objection by defendant, on the theory that the difference in the market value of the property as a whole, before and after the injury to the well, was the proper method by which the loss should be estimated. No points suggesting the application of a contrary rule <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>were presented by appellant, and it was not until the inotion for a new trial that it was urged a different test should be applied.
