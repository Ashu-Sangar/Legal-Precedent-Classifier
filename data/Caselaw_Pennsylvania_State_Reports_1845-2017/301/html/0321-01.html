The clear import of the case is that the state court does not act solely as a federal agency, but exercises judicial functions.

Schwimmer, <a href="/us/279/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="279 U.S. 644" data-case-ids="3906090" data-case-paths="/us/279/0644-01">279 U. S. 644</a>, <a href="/us/279/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="279 U.S. 644" data-case-ids="3906090" data-case-paths="/us/279/0644-01">49 Sup. Ct. 448</a>, rules the case to the contrary. The Act of 1906 requires that before any one is admitted to citizenship, he shall declare on oath in open court that he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same. The qualification, “so far as they are in accord with the moral law of Jesus Christ” would raise quite an independent thought. It carries with it the conviction that some of our laws are not in accord with the moral law of Jesus Christ, and these he will not support or defend. The difficulty with appellant’s position is that he sets up his own conscience or will as the sole judge to determine what laws are not in accord with the moral law of Jesus Christ. We might point to laws contested with much vigor on this point.</p>

The oath is not one to be debated; its equivalent in other language is not a legitimate subject of discussion. It predicates a definite state of mind in those seeking admission. The naturalization clause is one of the most important provisions of the Constitution, as is the legislation thereunder. Judges, who accept into citizenship one who wishes to subtract from its declared requirements, or attempts to limit or modify its intent, open the door for further infractions and anarchy may stalk in unmolested. No sophistry of illu<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>sionary reasoning can minimize the ordinary import of the oath. It would be much more in keeping with intellectual honesty to say openly that we do not regard Congress as capable of enacting rules, or hold that regardless of what is laid down we think the applicant should be admitted to citizenship. If one desiring citizenship, holding views contrary to those prescribed by Congress for membership in the United States, may, because of superior education, age, or mental reservation, become a citizen notwithstanding the rule, why have a rule at all? Admission would then depend on the inclination of the judge. It makes little difference what judges may think of the views of those seeking naturalization; Congress has pointed the way with unmistakable directness, and has declared that an applicant must agree under oath to support and defend the laws of the United States; it is for us to follow the law, not to legislate. The court below was clearly right in denying the applicant admission on the terms he wished to impose on the national government.</p>
