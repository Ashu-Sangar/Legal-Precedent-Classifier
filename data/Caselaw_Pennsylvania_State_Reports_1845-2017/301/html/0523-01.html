The mother may or may not have owed a duty to maintain him, depending on the circumstances at the time of the parent’s death.

When a child is an inmate of a county home as an indigent, the poor laws provide for support from a class of relatives,. The obligation for support of inmates of state institutions is controlled by the Act of June 12,1913, P. L. 494. Keeping in mind that pecuniary loss as to adults is built on acts and conduct prior to the death of the parent, if the mother contributed nothing to his support because she was absolved therefrom under that act, no expectation of pecuniary advantage exists, hence no right to damages in Stephen or his representatives. However, if she was obliged to support him, the duty thus enjoined would raise a presumption of expectancy. If she did in fact support him, he would have an expectancy. Then, too, Stephen may have had a separate estate. The difficulty we encounter is from the failure of the record to show any of the facts necessary on which to predicate a loss. Damages are never presumed, the burden of showing facts which would bring any claimant into the class within the rule that entitles him to recover under the act rests on the one asserting the claim: Beck v.

The mother had a right to their earnings until they reached their majority, and she owed a duty to support them for the same period: Act of May 5, 1911, P. L. 177. The law presumes the family relation and pecuniary loss to one under age. Their damage would be the difference between the value of their mother’s services, maintenance and spending money furnished to the minors, and the amount the parent would probably have received from the earnings of the children until twenty-one, and after twenty-one, in view of the relationship here established, their probable contributions to the mother during her life or as long as the family relation was not severed. It is urged that the services of <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>the mother was no more than a housekeeper, — citing a Texas case. This is not the correct view. Their mother’s services consisted of so many indefinable acts of tender solicitude, frugality, industry, usefulness and attention to her children which only a mother knows how and when to give. These services, in addition to managing the household, buying clothing and food, washing, cooking, and general care and supervision of the house, are certainly more valuable than those of a housekeeper or servant and therefore worth more. Her age, health, expectancy and diminishing power to serve, all these items are proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>

These adult children might reasonably expect to receive from their mother the same shelter, care, attention and service until her death as each had been given before; now that she is gone, the services cannot be secured altogether from paid help.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[260,1530,1152,849]]]'>Appellant’s contention that Ernest, the youngest child, and in fact all the children at home, have not suffered loss because their earnings have been or might have been of more value than the parent’s services, demonstrates nothing but that there might be no possible net loss. This might be an argument for the jury, but it does not create a situation on which to base binding instructions. The mere fact that his brothers and sisters contributed their earnings to the mother would not alter or limit this pecuniary loss to the minor who contributed nothing. These payments may be considered in the same light as though the parent used her own money. They certainly were not made for the benefit of the injuring party; the mother made no profit and she gave the children, in spending money, much that was given to her.</p>

It is the pecuniary value of the life of that mother to these children which you can consider in this case and nothing else. Compensation for the loss of life was given to certain survivors by the Act of 1855. The law chose to regard it as property in a certain sense. It was to be established by the same standard as other property, to wit, its pecuniary value.” It will be seen that much of this instruction violates en<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>tirely the fundamental principle for the basis of ascertaining value, and, unless this court will hold that the human life has a value as property to which all the children are entitled, regardless of their situation, or to which the husband or wife may be entitled regardless of his or her situation, this instruction cannot be sustained. The damages are not based on the value of the life as property. The very first rule laid down by this court was that they are based on a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage based on past acts, and should be confined to those who were entitled to that pecuniary advantage from those past acts. This is the clear effect of Schnatz v. Phila. &amp; Reading Railroad, and other cases quoted above. In the same line is Glaseo v.
