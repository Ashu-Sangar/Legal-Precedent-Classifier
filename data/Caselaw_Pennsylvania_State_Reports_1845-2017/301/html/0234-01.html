The lessee agreed to pay the taxes assessed, and a fixed rental for the first five years, at the expiration of which time, and at like <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>succeeding intervals, the amount should be determined by a revaluation of the premises. The right to assign or sublet was given, and the contract bound the lessee, its successors and assigns. On January 22, 1922, it did assign to an admittedly straw man, Samuel Gross, the entire term, reserving, however, for 21 years the payment of an annual sum of $7,500, in addition to the taxes and rent payable to the lessor, which the assignee covenanted to liquidate, and to this obligation also bound his representatives and assigns. To secure faithful performance, the original lease was deposited with the Greenfield Co., who were given entire charge of the property, with right to collect the rentals, paying, first, the lessors, second, the compensation for 21 years reserved by the Realty Associates, Inc., and the balance to the assignee or his assigns.</p>

Rentals fixed were paid the lessor until a revaluation was had, in which proceeding, it is averred, Greenfield &amp; Co., acting as agent for the defendants, undisclosed principals, took part, resulting in an increased annual charge. The sum agreed on was paid until 1928, when it was discovered that those having the beneficial enjoyment of the property were in default in satisfaction of taxes, whereupon demand was made of their representative for payment of the sums due. This obligation was not complied with, though the advancement of the rent accruing continued until May 13th of that year. Thereafter, this action of assumpsit was brought, against those having the use of the property, to recover overdue installments of rent, and for the amount of unpaid taxes as well. Affidavits of defense were filed raising questions of law, liability being denied on the ground that those named as defendants were undisclosed principals, as to whom <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>there was no privity of estate with plaintiff, and contending that the assignee named in the written agreement could alone be proceeded against.

The agreement with the Associates, Inc., was under seal, as was the assignment to the straw man, Gross, but plaintiffs insist that those having the beneficial enjoyment or use are liable for the performance of the sealed covenants, binding as they did their successors and assigns. If any liability exists it must arise from the proof of a privity of estate rather than of contract.</p>

But this was not the case of a trust, but an allegation of the assumption of the covenants by the undisclosed principals through their agent, who took charge of the property. Nor do we see merit in the suggestion that the relation of the parties was altered because the Associates, Inc., provided in its assignment for additional compensation to it, running over 21 years, retaining the power to reenter if default occurred: Lloyd v. Cozens, 2 Ashmead 131. The transaction is still to be treated as an assignment, with the incidents flowing therefrom, though such a reservation appears as shown by the cases cited by appellees: Gillette Bros. v.

It must be kept in mind that judgment was here entered summarily for want of a sufficient statement.

It does allege, however, that the lease was taken by the Associates, Inc., who assigned to a straw man, Gross, under agreement that the written contract be placed with Greenfield &amp; Co., who should have entire control. It did so act, for and in conjunction with the other defendants, using the rents collected to pay the lessor directly, taking part in the revaluation of the property, adjusting the rental for the second five-year period, and through it the undisclosed principals had the beneficial enjoyment of the property, though not personally in possession, if the averments of the statement be taken as true.</p>

In the first place, the statement of claim contains no averment or recital of facts to show that defendants either had the actual use of the property in controversy or were entitled to its beneficial enjoyment. Plaintiffs satisfy themselves with the mere statement of their conclusion that “Gross, in accepting the assignment of the said lease and in executing the said articles of agreement dated January 26,1922, acted as agent for defendants......as undisclosed principals.” Jules E. Mastbaum, the decedent of the first three defendants, like the last named defendant, Greenfield &amp; Co., was a real estate broker and agent; for all that appears in the present statement of claim, their connection with this property may have been merely as agents of someone else entitled to its beneficial enjoyment. While I find no averment in the statement of claim which indicates what Mastbaum’s real relation to this property was, and the <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>averment as to Greenfield &amp; Co. would be entirely consistent with the performance of its duties as a real estate agent, yet my chief difficulty with the majority opinion is that, treating, as it does, Gross as a mere straw man, I cannot agree that his undisclosed principals may be held equally liable with him. The transactions here involved are not simple contracts, but writings, properly under seal, creating relationships which have to do with real property, a field in which straw men have long been used for the purpose of avoiding personal responsibility under the strict rules of law relating to ownership of that class of property.</p>

Of recent years, the attempt has been to make the buying, selling and ownership of real estate as easy and uncomplicated as that of other classes of property; the right use of straw men facilitates this commendable end, and has been sanctioned by us. Owners who create long-term leases, as did the present plaintiffs, can readily protect themselves against the usé, by their lessees and the latter’s assignees, of irre<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>sponsible straw men (though plaintiffs make no averment that Gross is such), in subsequent dealings with the demised property, by stipulating that no assignment or sublease shall be entered into without the written consent of the original lessor, a provision ordinarily found in real estate leases but significantly absent from the present instrument, which simply provides that the lessee may either assign the lease or sublet the premises, continuing personally liable to lessors, and that all subtenants or assignees shall, at the option of the lessors, likewise be liable to them. The general rule is that, where “a lessee takes a lease for an unnamed principal, but in his own name, [the law] will not render the unnamed principal liable for rent”: 36 O. J. 370; see also cases from various jurisdictions, supporting this principle, cited in a note to <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.L.R.%20164" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="32 A.L.R. 164">32 A. L. R. 164</a>. Had the original lease in this case been made to Gross and if it were subsequently proved he was acting for an unnamed principal, the latter would not be liable to make payments under the covenants of the lease. It seems to me the same principle should apply here, if Gross be considered an assignee of the original lessee.</p>
