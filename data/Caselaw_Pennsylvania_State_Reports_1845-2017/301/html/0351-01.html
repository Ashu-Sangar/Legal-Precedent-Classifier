He was directed by the insurance company to adjust the loss, and that embodied all necessary steps for that purpose. The letters offered in evidence, showing in themselves that they constituted the correspondence in relation to appellee’s loss between the principal and agent, corroborated the testimony of the-witness as to his agency, if that was necessary. They must, of course, be shown to be authentic letters of the company. The court erred in excluding them and in refusing to permit the agent to testify as to his authority.</p>

The appraisers shall then appraise the loss or damage, stating separately sound value and loss or damage to each item...... An award in writing so itemized......shall determine the amount of sound value and loss or damage.” It required the appraisers to state separately the sound value and loss or damage to each item. The insurance covered a building, contents, stock of goods, office furniture, fixtures, and household furniture. The appraisal agreement, though stating that appellees “have sustained a loss by fire ......on two-story, composition roof, brick building, occupied as general store and dwelling,......[and] a disagreement has arisen between the parties hereto, as to the amount of such loss,” covered in fact all items of loss as mentioned above. It continues: “[The parties named] are hereby appointed appraisers, to appraise, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy [or policies], the sound value of said property and the amount of loss or damage......stating separately sound value and loss or damage to each item.” This follows the terms of the policy as to appraisal. The award did <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>not follow the terms of the submission; only one item was appraised, the building.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[265,449,1149,414]]]'>Appellant offered the award as final and conclusive as to this item. The court below refused to receive the award because it had not been shown that the agreement on which the award was based had been made by the adjuster under competent authority. Had the court admitted the testimony as to the agent’s authority, the agreement and the award could have been received in evidence.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[260,883,1152,909]]]'>Both were further objected to as not being properly pleaded under the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, as amended by the Act of April 22, 1929, P. L. 627. This objection is unsound. The affidavit set forth both documents and their purpose as a defense, and appellees had full notice of its contents. That the words “new matter” did not precede these allegations, and that there was no endorsement on the affidavit of defense of a requirement that plaintiff should reply thereto, does not operate to exclude proof of the defense averred. The Act of 1929, while providing, in a number of respects, for such exclusion where there is a failure to comply with its terms, does not do so as regards the two matters above set forth. If plaintiffs were not satisfied with the affidavit as a pleading, because of these omissions, their remedy was a motion to strike it off, as provided by section 21 of the Act of 1915, P. L. 487.</p>

The dispute was apparently over the value of the loss to the building, nevertheless the agreement, speaking according to the terms of the policy, contemplated placing a value on all items of loss insured against. This was not done. The assured may well say: “I agreed that the arbitrators should make an award as to all items of loss, not as to one item only.” It is no answer that some losses were too difficult to estimate, too indefinite to ascertain, or forgotten, hence not made. The agreement was to be a complete settlement <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>and to prevent litigation; the award did not follow the submission and it encouraged litigation. While it is not necessary to provide that all matters shall be so appraised (Cooley’s Briefs on Insurance, 2d ed., volume 6, page 6178, and Milwaukee Mechanics Ins. Co. v. Ciaccio, 38 Fed. 2d 153, rendered February 25, 1930, U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit), this agreement did so. If there is a failure to pass upon all the matters submitted to arbitration, or if the award covers only a part of the loss or damage included in the submission, the award is not binding: 26 C. J. 424. While under the submission the award is not conclusive, it is persuasive evidence to go to the jury on the value of the loss to the building. We will not determine all the questions relating to the award because there are other charges averred in the record with regard to it which may ultimately determine the question as to its utility for any purpose when the case is retried.</p>
    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[144,1342,1154,1075]],["BL_382.1",382,[272,360,1150,913]]]'>Appellees urge the award was made under the Act of April 25,1927, P. L. 381, but the insurance company did not follow the act. The first section of the act changed the common law with respect to certain agreements to arbitrate: See Bashford v. West Miami Land Co., <a href="/pa/295/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="295 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1115118" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0560-01">295 Pa. 560</a>. The act provides a method whereby one of the parties may compel the other to arbitrate; it also provides a remedy under which arbitration takes place, but there is nothing in the act to repeal the old-time arbitration, or prevent suit on the award if the parties choose to follow that course. The act is not exclusive but it does provide a more effective remedy for prosecuting such agreements. In any case, it is questionable whether insurance agreements for arbitration are within the act. We need not decide that point. See Petition of American Ins. Co., <a href="/ad/208/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="208 A.D. 168" data-case-ids="4763865" data-case-paths="/ad/208/0168-01">208 App. Div. 168</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20N.Y.S.%20206" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="203 N.Y.S. 206">203 N.
