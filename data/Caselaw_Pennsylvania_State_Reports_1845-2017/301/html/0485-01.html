This is a wise provision of the statute, for where the pleadings clearly show the case turns on a question of law it is vain to invoke the aid of a jury. The trial court properly held that this is the status of the instant case. In 1921 the First Pool Gas Coal Company, plaintiff, bought the land in question of Adolph Doerr and wife and gave a bond and mortgage thereon. Default having been made in payment and judgment having been entered on the bond, an execution was issued by Avhich the land Avas <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>sold at sheriff’s sale and bought by Doerr in 1923. The same year it was conveyed by him to the Bankers Coal Company, now the Wheeler Run Coal Company, defendant. In 1929, approximately six years thereafter, the present action of ejectment was brought, upon the averment that the sheriff’s sale was so tainted with fraud as to constitute the purchaser thereat a trustee ex malificio for plaintiff and that the defendant coal company purchased with knowledge thereof.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[253,818,1153,1561]],["BL_513.1",513,[128,327,1151,915]]]'>The defendants’ answer, after denying the allegations of fraud, avers (paragraph 25) : “Plaintiff’s claim is further unenforceable, as disclosed by the averments of plaintiff’s declaration and abstract of title, by reason of the bar of the statute of limitations in such cases made and provided.” To which plaintiff’s reply is: “The averments of paragraph 25 of defendants’ answer are denied.” Defendants rely on section six of the Act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 533, Stewart’s Purdon’s Digest, volume 2, page 2278, which reads, inter alia: “No right of entry shall accrue, or actions be maintained ......to enforce any implied or resulting trust as to realty, but within five years after such......trust accrued, with the right of entry...... Provided, that as to any one affected with a trust, by reason of his fraud, the said limitation shall begin to run only from the discovery thereof, or when, by reasonable diligence, the party defrauded might have discovered the same.” The pleadings contain no averment that plaintiff was at any time ignorant of the alleged fraud. On the contrary, plaintiff attaches to and makes part of its abstract of title the copy of an elaborate written notice it gave the defendant coal company in October, 1923, prior to the deed from Doerr to it, in which is set forth in substance every act of alleged fraud now complained of. As to this, plaintiff’s abstract avers, inter alia, “The plaintiff notified all of the said parties in writing, of the fraudulent acts complained of in this abstract or proposed to be done. A copy of said notice,......marked Exhibit <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>¿B’ and made part hereof, was served on all the parties named therein, on October 23,1923, or about that date.” Hence, in lieu of ignorance, plaintiff affirmatively places upon the record written evidence of its full knowledge of the alleged fraud practically six years before the inception of this suit. It is not important on whom the plaintiff served the notice (Exhibit B), but that it sent out such a notice is conclusive of its knowledge of the averments therein stated. Any right of entry in plaintiff because of a resulting trust was complete when Doerr conveyed the land to the defendant coal company in November, 1923. Plaintiff’s mere denial that its right is barred by the statute is of no moment in face of the record. The Act of 1856 controls the case and the question is purely one of law, no less so because the defendants deny the allegations of fraud, as that question is unimportant in view of the statute.</p>
