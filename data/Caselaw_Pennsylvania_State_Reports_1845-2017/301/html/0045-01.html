It was alleged that the bank failed to make the sale and purchase, as the cashier, acting in its behalf, had undertaken to do and that the White Oil stock declined in value until it was worth only thirty cents a share, whereas the Texas Company stock increased in value until it became worth $54 per share.

Defendant asserted not only the agreement with the cashier, but that the latter had many times promised in the bank’s behalf that it would make up the loss to defendant by the failure to carry out its undertaking and would see that he suffered no loss. Defendant further asserted that when the various notes came to be renewed, and he objected to renewing them, the cashier would cause him to sign the renewals by the assurance that he would be taken care of and suffer no loss</p>
