The second appellant complains because the court below held that a certain provision of the will now before us violated the act against accumulations, and the first, because the accumulations in question were'awarded to the heirs of testator under the intestate laws, instead of to the widow, who was the life beneficiary.</p>

The residuary clause of the will also provides that “all stock dividends consisting of shares of stock of the corporations issuing them shall be considered as principal.” This last provision gave rise to the present case.</p>

L. 503,” and, being such, it was inoperative. That conclusion meets with our approval, for no one can be permitted to set aside the public policy of the State by the simple expedient of designating by another name that which the courts have repeatedly decided to be income.</p>

      <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>In Harkness’s Est., <a href="/pa/283/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="283 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1090530" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0464-01">283 Pa. 464</a>, 466-7, this court said it was a “rule of property,” long established with us, that stock dividends, declared after the death of the testator, above the amount necessary to keep intact the value of the shares as they were at that date, must be distributed as income; and when a rule of property applies to a given state of fact, we have held that it controls, even though a testator, after providing for a condition to which it is applicable, may in effect provide also that the rule in question is not to control. For instance, in Lauer v. Hoffman, <a href="/pa/241/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="241 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="976078" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0315-01">241 Pa. 315</a>, 317, 318, testator placed a provision in his will which required the application of the rule in Shelley’s Case, thus creating a fee; then he added, “but in no event whatever shall the fee simple to the said real estate vest” in the devisees named by him. This court said that such a provision was “utterly inoperative to prevent the legal consequence” of the words which, under the rule in Shelley’s Case, created the fee, and that this was so no matter how plain the contrary intent might be. In the present case, the testator provided that “all stock dividends shall...... be considered as principal.” This provision, so far as the items now in controversy are concerned, runs counter to our established rule of property that such dividends, earned after the death of the testator, which do not decrease the intact value of the stock as of that date, are income, — a rule that cannot be avoided, as presently attempted, by, under a testamentary direction, treating dividends which would otherwise be considered income as principal, if, as here, the result of that course is to impinge on the act against accumulations. This being the case, despite testator’s direction that all stock dividends shall be considered as principal, those here involved remain income; and, since this income is in effect ordered to be unlawfully accumulated, it becomes presently distributable. The law was correctly so held, under somewhat similar circumstances, in Wentz’s Est., <a href="/pa-d-c/12/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="12 Pa.

The court below decided that, because the direction which gave rise to the unlawful accumulation was contained in the residuary clause of the will, every provision in that part of the testament was affected, and no beneficiary there named could take the accumulated dividends. The fund in question was accordingly awarded to testator’s heirs at law.</p>

Hence, the accumulation with which we have to deal “relates,” in the words of the guiding rule for distribution laid down in White’s Est., <a href="/pa/223/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="223 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="960970" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0508-01">supra,</a> to “a vested interest taking effect in possession”; that <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>is, if the present' accumulation had not been directed, the dividends involved would have belonged to the widow, — still alive and claiming, — who at the death of her husband immediately became possessed, and went into the enjoyment, of “a vested interest” in that part of his estate which produced the unlawfully accumulated income represented by the dividends here in question.</p>
    <p id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[114,737,1153,960]]]'>On the other hand, in all of the cases relied on by the court below, the persons laying claim to the unlawful accumulations either lacked a vested interest to which the accumulation related, or their interests had not taken immediate effect in possession, in the sense that the person claiming, or for whom the accumulations were claimed, had the enjoyment of his interest during the course of such accumulations. Thus their cases, unlike the present one, were not within the first part of the governing rule, laid down in White’s Est., supra; they fell within the second part of that rule, which deals with accumulations relating to interests “not vested in possession,” dictating that such income shall go to subsequent residuary legatees or devisees, unless the residuary estate itself is the subject of the provision which brought about the unlawful accumulation of the income in question and that, when it is, such income shall go to the next of kin under intestate laws.</p>

In the present case the provision for the widow of testator is contained in the residuary clause of the will, but it gives her a vested interest to take effect in immediate possession, and the accumulations relate to that interest, therefore the case falls within the first part of the rule which the court below accepted as its guide, not within the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>second, and tlie accumulations go at once to the widow, who is the beneficiary, just as they would go had the will named her as beneficiary prior to, instead of in, its residuary clause.</p>

We said (page 65) that if the three residuary legatees could “be held to have taken, at the death of their father, such a vested interest in the corpus of the trust estate from which the income in question [was] derived, as, disregarding the implied direction for accumulation, would entitle them to such income,......then they [would have to] be awarded the whole of the...... fund”; but that, since the daughters (residuary legatees) had no such vested estate in immediate possession, the award of accumulated income must be to testator’s heirs at law. Before making this award, however, speaking (at pages 66-7) in connection with the Act of 1853 and the rule in White’s Est., we said, as to the test of the daughters’ right to the accumulations, “Here, the residuary estate itself is the subject of the provision, so the controlling question......is, do the accumulations in controversy represent income accruing on a vested interest taking effect in possession; [or] in other words, have the daughters [residuary legatees] the present beneficial ownership of the principal from which the income [unlawfully accumulated] was derived?” This, with its context, shows again that, had we found the daughters possessed of such an interest as just described, the award would have been to them, under the first part of the rule in White’s Estate, instead of, as it was, under the second part of that rule, to testator’s heirs at law.</p>

Moreover, in each of these cases and in others where the life tenant was refused an award of the unlawful accumulations, as, for instance, in Weinman’s Est., <a href="/pa/223/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="223 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="960970" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0508-01">223 Pa. 508</a>, the gift to the life tenant (that is, the devise or bequest itself) either directly or impliedly limited the amount of income that beneficiary should take, and thus excluded any addition thereto, — which is not so in the present case.</p>

An account hied during the life of the son showed accumulations which, being held unlawful, were properly awarded to the heir of testator under the intestate laws (who happened to be the son). We say “were properly awarded,” for the will expressly limited the income which the son should receive as life beneficiary and no one was designated therein to take either principal or accumulated income until the time for ultimate distribution arrived. The son took as heir, not as life tenant.</p>

On the death of this life tenant, the accumulations were to go to his issue, if he left lawful issue (see White’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20D.%20207" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="2 Pa.

This created an unlawful accumulation of income, which, it was held (page 34), belonged to the “residuary legatees,” because the life beneficiary was entitled to only so much of income as he had already received and (page 35) “the contingent character of the gift to [his] issue,” — “such issue as he may leave,” — prevented them from taking the accumulations.</p>
