Wineman petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Somerset County for a declaratory judgment to determine the “right, status and legal relations” of all parties who might have an interest in certain real estate, which she had “in charge” as surviving executrix of the estate of S. Anice Cryan, deceased, and had been “caring for and renting” since the latter’s death. In rendering the judgment prayed for, the court below so construed the will of decedent that the petitioner, one other of the devisees named in that document, and the heirs at law of a deceased devisee, were declared to be owners in fee of the premises in controversy, as tenants in common. The petitioner, hereinafter called plaintiff, being dissatisfied with the judgment, has appealed.</p>

As to the second point of construction, any interpretation other than that which we placed on the statute would have meant the practical abolition of all set forms of actions at law and equitable proceedings, a result in no wise intended by the legislature. The provision in section 1 of the statute, that the courts shall have the right to act thereunder “whether or not further relief is or could be claimed,” does not mean that proceedings by declaratory judgment are available whenever any controversy exists, but rather that such relief may be had even though, for full relief, other and additional legal remedies must be resorted to after the issues in the declaratory judgment proceedings have been determined. The act as a whole shows this to be its meaning.</p>

Her first provision as to these properties, “I do not want my houses in Windber sold under five or six years and not then if my [heirs] want to keep them,” denotes a gift; for “keep” means to “retain” (Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary), and one can retain <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>only that which he already has, or possesses, and he cannot have or possess something belonging to another until the latter transfers it to him. The provision just quoted, standing alone, can be read only as giving the heirs the right to keep the houses in fee; in other words, the provision creates a fee. In this connection, see section 9, Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. (1832-3) 249-50, to the effect that “All devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation, or otherwise, in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.” (See also same language in Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P.

In short, the provisions which relate to a possible sale have no effect on the fee given to the heirs; and the inquiry as to those testatrix meant to be her heirs is answered by the provisions following the devise of the fee, where the names of those she intended to take the Windber houses are enumerated.</p>

Some sixteen years have passed since the death of testatrix, and the properties in question are still unsold; so it may be assumed that the devisees “wanted to keep them,” and what would have happened had they been sold within the specified five years need not be further considered. But, in this connection, it may be noted that testatrix, though not so directing, indicates a wish to have the Windber houses retained in her estate till “all bills for repairs to them, owed by her, <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>should be paid, and long enough to permit appellant to pay for the Philadelphia home at the rate of $20 per month, from the rents of these Windber houses, if her adopted daughter elected to follow that course. Testatrix apparently thought it would take at least five years after her death to accomplish these results; so, probably to discourage her brother John (the only male devisee) from attempting to force a sale within that period, after giving him a fee, along with the other devisees, she attempted to cut his share to $50, not in any and all events, but only in case the property devised was sold within five years. Whatever was her intention in that regard, it appears as a subordinate one, ill-expressed, which, as before said, cannot override or diminish the fee previously created: Pattin v.
