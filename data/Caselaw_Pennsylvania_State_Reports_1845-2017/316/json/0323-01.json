        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to enter judgment in favor of the defendant notwithstanding a verdict of $15,927 for plaintiff.\nAt 10 p. m., October 29,1931, the plaintiff was operating an automobile on the public highway. As he traveled toward Sykesville he encountered patches of fog, described by him as \u201clight fog, the headlights shone through them and the highway was visible.\u201d The road traversed was \u201cover hills and through valleys\u201d and plaintiff \u201cpassed through a number of fog pockets.\u201d These pockets of fog were visible \u201cseveral hundred feet ahead.\u201d As plaintiff came around a curve about two miles from Sykesville he saw at the bottom of a grade what he \u201cthought was a slight amount of fog.\u201d He soon realized the fog was heavier and put on his brake and as he entered that fog he saw the outline of a truck bed and, as he testified, he \u201cwas putting on [his] brake but the distance was too short\u201d and he \u201cimmediately crashed into the truck.\u201d Plaintiff said: \u201cThe first I saw the truck was when I ran into the fog bank.\u201d He described this fog bank as \u201ca good many times heavier than the previous fog pockets\u201d and that \u201cthe visibility at that point was very poor after\u201d he \u201centered the fog.\u201d The truck was defendant\u2019s, who claimed it was at the time proceeding at a speed of three to five miles an hour in the same direction as plaintiff. The latter said the truck was standing still.\nPlaintiff alleged defendant was negligent \u201cin operating the truck in a careless manner and without the necessary control of said truck under the circumstances......and in failing to have his car equipped with a tail-light.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that he \u201csaw no tail-light burning\u201d on the truck.\nWe find in this record such a deficiency of evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence that the latter\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. might well be sustained on that ground alone. Por a truck to proceed, on the proper side of the highway, through a fog bank at a cautious rate of speed or even to stand still there in a proper position for a reasonable length of time for any legitimate reason is not in itself negligence. Fog may be so dense on the highway that to proceed at any rate of speed is imprudent. No violation of the Motor Vehicle Code by the defendant was shown here. That plaintiff \u201cdid not see\u201d a tail-light on the truck is negative evidence and of minimal, if any, value on the issue: Was there a tail-light burning on defendant\u2019s truck? Such testimony is of no avail in the face of the positive testimony of the driver of the truck that he knew the tail-light was burning at the time of the accident because he \u201ccould see the reflection of it in the mirror before we came to the fog.\u201d\nHowever, the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s negligence is so conclusive that it alone \u2014 regardless of whether or not there was evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence \u2014 requires the entry of judgment n. o. v. in favor of defendant Cautious movement in fog is required of motorists (as it always has been of navigators). To take \u201ca leap in the dark\u201d is to invite self-injury or self-destruction. On the night of this unfortunate accident the plaintiff had been well aware of the presence of fog on the highway. Even though he characterized this as \u201clight fog,\u201d he should nevertheless have proceeded with the utmost caution both from fog bank to fog bank and through them. When he testified, as he did, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see that truck before\u201d he \u201centered into that fog bank\u201d and that \u201cthe first\u201d he \u201csaw the truck was when\u201d he \u201cran into the fog bank,\u201d he left with reason the choice of but one inference, to wit, that he was negligent. He further admitted on cross-examination that his car was going down hill a short distance before it reached the pocket of fog where the truck was, and that the truck was a short space from the foot of the incline and on an up-grade and that this made it \u201cimpossible for the lights to illuminate as well as when it was on the same grade.\u201d\nThis collision would not have occurred if the plaintiff had had his car \u201cunder control\u201d as he approached defendant\u2019s truck. We said in Galliano v. East Penn Electric Co., 303 Pa. 498, at 503, 154 A. 805: \u201cIt is the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle at all times to have his car under control, and having one\u2019s car under control means having it under such control that it can be stopped before doing injury to any person in any situation that is reasonably likely to arise under the circumstances.\u201d That the situation plaintiff met here was one \u201creasonably likely to arise under the circumstances\u201d then prevailing is self-evident. There is far more likelihood of crashing into a vehicle on a foggy land highway than there is of crashing into a vessel on a foggy sea, for the highways of the sea are wide, yet it is an imperative rule of navigation that there must be no speed in a fog. Disregard of that rule has often led to tragedy.\nPlaintiff\u2019s speed being excessive under the circumstances, it was not necessary to prove the degree of its excessiveness. It may be noted, however, that the speed was such that, though the truck with its contents weighed 12,000 pounds, its body was \u201cpushed up toward the cab\u201d and \u201cbent the cabin,\u201d that the motor of plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9 \u201cwas on the ground, that the radiator was totally demolished and pushed back where the motor should have been,\u201d that plaintiff himself was rendered unconscious and remained so until after he was taken to the hospital, and that the injuries he sustained were so serious as to confine him to the hospital for eleven weeks. Plaintiff\u2019s own testimony and the admitted facts as to the extent of the injuries to both coup\u00e9 and truck and to the plaintiff himself lead to but one conclusion and that is, that plaintiff, in driving his car into a fog bank which was clearly visible to him for at least 500 feet before he entered into it, was contemptuous of caution. That he \u201cthought this was a slight amount of fog\u201d does not excuse him. Fog is fog and its obscurative qualities are known to all individuals who possess even the slight amount of intelligence legally required to qualify one to drive an automobile on the public highways. When plaintiff drove his car into a fog bank which hid a truck from his view, he simply spurned prudence and relied on chance. That chance failed him is his misfortune, not defendant\u2019s fault.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is herein entered for defendant non obstante veredicto.",
