Appellants seek a new trial for the purpose of introducing evidence which they term after-discovered but which the record discloses was known to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the time of the trial, and could have been produced by the exercise of proper diligence. A more serious objection is the fact that the testimony, if given, would simply be corroborative of evidence introduced at the trial. \u201cWhere after-discovered evidence is of a cumulative nature, and it is problematic whether it would have made any change in the result, the question of a new trial is for the court below, and, in the absence of abuse, its discretion will not be overruled.\u201d Hinman v. Hinman, 283 Pa. 29, 32. See also Hunter v. Bremer, 256 Pa. 257.\nJudgment affirmed.",
