In the application, Brandwene stated, in reply to questions, that he had not, in the preceding five years, consulted a physician for any ailment, except “Dr. C. L. Mattas, in the year 1926 for cold in head.” This answer was so false that it could hardly have been more so. As a matter of fact, Brandwene had consulted Dr. Mattas in the two years preceding the making of his application at least five times for various ailments, including arthritis and inflammation of the muscles, and had at various times in the five-year period been treated by other physicians for more serious illnesses. In 1925, he was confined to his home with influenza; during this illness, he was attended by a Dr. Wormser and required the services of a nurse. This illness lasted from April 25th to May 23d, and he subsequently claimed and received disability benefits for this period from an insurance company. Later in the same year, he entered a hospital for a week and had his tonsils removed by a Dr. Bishop; as a result he was unable to work for about two and a half weeks, and for the time thus lost he also received disability benefits. Again, in 1928, he was sick in bed at home with influenza from February 10th to February 20th; during this period, he was treated by a Dr. Morris. On account of his illness, he claimed and received, upon another insurance policy, benefits for total disability during a period of almost five weeks. In March, 1931, within the two-year period in which the policy could be contested, Brandwene'applied to plaintiff for benefits for permanent total disability caused by an enlargement of the heart. The plaintiff’s investigation of the claim disclosed the above facts, indicating that Brandwene’s statements in his application for the insurance policy had been false, whereupon it tendered back the amount paid as premiums and attempted to rescind the policy. Brandwene refused, and this suit followed.</p>

Even if this concession -were not made, the facts of this case would present no room for an argument to the contrary. The illnesses for which Brandwene consulted other physicians were not trivial, and the plaintiff was entitled to know of them. While it may be that plaintiff would not have refused to insure Brandwene because of these illnesses, certainly it is not improbable that had it known of them the company would have rejected his application for insurance. The facts as to the applicant’s more serious illnesses were, therefore, matters material to the risk, of which the company should have been informed.</p>

This argument imposes too heavy a burden on human credulity. The learned chancellor found that the untruthful statements were made deliberately, and we do not see how he could have done otherwise. We cannot believe that when Brandwene signed the application for insurance he had forgotten that three times in the previous five years he had suffered periods of total disability: once as a result of an operation in a hospital and twice as a result of attacks of influenza which confined him on each occasion to his home for over a month. Moreover, he must have been aware that he had consulted Dr. Mattas many more times than he said he had. In failing to disclose these material facts Brandwene did not deal fairly with the company; there is no room for any other conclusion than that his statement in the application that he had consulted a doctor <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>only once in the past five years, and that for a cold in the head, was deliberately false and fraudulent.</p>

On the other hand, defendants produced no evidence to show that plaintiff did not place such reliance upon the untruthful statement in the application.
