The difficulty is not so much with the words “passenger or otherwise” as with the equivocal context “engaging..... in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.” The insured, when killed, was no more engaged in an expedition, in the common or normal sense of the word, than if he had been a passenger on a train or bus. A passenger engaged in an aeronautic expedition would seem to be one having <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>some part in the conduct and operation of the expedition. On the other hand, if “engaging as a passenger” was intended merely to describe persons who would be regarded as passengers within the ordinary meaning of that word, without having any part in the conduct of the aeronautic expedition, the phrase was not well chosen. Certainly, as the word is generally defined, a passenger takes no part in the operation of the vehicle in which he is carried. So far as appears, the parties used the words in their commonly understood sense and so intended them to measure their obligation.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[260,946,1154,911]]]'>Appellant notes that, in 1926, aviation was extremely hazardous and not generally recognized as a method of transporting passengers, and suggests that the parties for that reason intended to include in the words “aeronautical expeditions” all flights by airplane; that is, that all travel by airplane in the conditions then existing would be excepted, because any flight might, perhaps, be considered an “expedition.” In spite of that arbitrary understanding, if conditions change and travel by airplane is no longer subject to the extraordinary hazard which once made a flight an expedition, the exception cannot be held to have been intended to apply. “The contract is still to be interpreted according to its true intent, although altered conditions may have varied the form of fulfilment”: Virginia v. West Virginia, <a href="/us/238/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="238 U.S. 202" data-case-ids="3676131" data-case-paths="/us/238/0202-01">238 U.

But, no special circumstances appearing, the parties must be held to have used the words — ordinary words — in their ordinarily accepted meaning: Restatement, Contracts, section 235 (a). As to that meaning there is no doubt. The assured was a passenger, but he was not engaged in an aeronautic expedition. With these views we can, of course, not follow Gibbs v. Equitable Life Assur.
