On the application of the Retirement Board of Allegheny County the court below directed the commissioners to draw and sign a warrant in the sum of $75,000 payable to the treasurer of the retirement board. The order was made pursuant to the Retirement Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, which provides that the commissioners “shall annually, in January, appropriate and pay into the Pension Fund not less than one-half [%] of one [1%] per cent and not more than two [2%] per cent of all available moneys received by the County as taxes during the preceding calendar year.”</p>

In the return of the two remaining commissioners, the successive Retirement Acts were challenged as unconstitutional in that they violate the following provisions of the Constitution: Article I, section 17; Article III, section 3, section 7, section 11, section 13, section 17, section 20 j<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the return also sets up gross neglect in the administration of the fund, its unsound and ruinous actuarial practices, its insolvency, and the confiscatory nature of the retirement pay to public officers illegally placed on the pension roll.</p>

    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[267,674,1151,694]]]'>The particular objection is to the clause requiring this appropriation to be made. It is argued that while the act gives notice that the county commissioners are authorized to appropriate, the real matter with the section is that instead of the words “they may appropriate,” the act requires that they “shall,” and it is for this reason the mandamus was issued. Standing alone this would be insufficient to defeat the statute; not infrequently “may” has been taken to mean “shall,” and “shall” has been taken to mean “may.” There is, however, no “may” in this act regarding the subject; the establishment of the fund and the payments thereto by the county and its employees are all mandatory.</p>

Under the Second Class County Act all employees receiving wages or salary were placed on the retirement register by the board on the effective date of the act. Prom that time payments were made by them until they satisfied the retirement or superannuation requirements. They were then eligible to retire and receive the retirement pay mentioned in the act, although no contributions had been made by them for years of service prior to the effective date of the act. Many of these employees, from service and age, were entitled to and did retire shortly after the act’s effective date by making but few payments as members of the system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The act required the county to make a contribution which presumptively would take care of the necessary reserve for future payments for these employees. It is now contended that the receipt of this full retired pay by such employees, not being based in its entirety on adequate present service after the effective date of the act, is, in reality, extra compensation for past services rendered, because of such contributions by the county.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We said in Busser v. Snyder, <a href="/pa/282/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="282 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1088338" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0440-01">282 Pa. 440</a>, 454, that the basis of retirement pay is neither charitable nor benevolent, but is the faithful, valuable service actually rendered over a long period of years. Retirement Acts, affecting many employees and officers, had been passed before the services were ren<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>dered, and the appropriations made, therefore, were for this “delayed compensation for these years of service actually given in the performance of public duties in their respective capacities.” These benefits under the Retirement Acts, as to elective constitutional officers, were, in effect, part of their salaries.</p>
    <p id="b197-3" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[207,673,1154,1407]]]'>It is also urged that these payments are, and the present act in fact provides for, pensions, if the payments are not made for past services. Pensions should not be confused with retired pay. A pension is a bounty or a gratuity given for services that were rendered in the past. This act provides for retirement pay. Retirement pay is defined as “adjusted compensation” presently earned, which, with contributions from employees, is payable in the future. The compensation is earned in the present, payable in the future to an employee, provided he possesses the qualifications required by the act, and complies with the terms, conditions, and regulations imposed on the receipt of retirement pay. Until an employee has earned his retirement pay, or until the time arrives when he may retire, his retirement pay is but an inchoate right; but when the conditions are satisfied, at that time retirement pay becomes a vested right of which the person entitled thereto cannot be deprived: it has ripened into a full contractual obligation. See Lynch v. U. S. (U. S. Supreme Court), decided June 4, 1934. True, section 312 of the Act of 1929 calls this system a “pension system” and the fund a “pension fund,” but in every part of the statute the system and fund created are of the character above described and the nomenclature has been changed to “retirement system” and “retirement fund” by the Act of May 22,1933, P. L. 840.</p>

First, prior to the present retirement system, there were other acts in existence providing for delayed compensation in the form of retirement pay. This is true in many instances in connection with the state system and in all such cases the potential reserve set up by the government or its agencies for this compensation under the earlier plans must be considered as applicable to the retirement pay in its new form under the present plan. To illustrate: consider the Retirement Acts relating to judges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> When, <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>to bring all employees under one general retirement system, tbe inducement was offered to judges and other public officers elected under tbe Constitution to join tbe employees’ retirement system and give up tbeir rights to certain retirement compensation, tbe right they possessed under tbe Acts of 1911 and 1919 was vested. This vested right was part of tbeir salaries as constitutional officers (Busser v. Snyder, supra) ; and it was, in the case of a judge joining tbe employees’ retirement system, carried over and made part of tbe state employees’ retirement system. This vested right to annual payments, presently capitalized, added value to tbe system’s necessary reserve funds. It was that member’s then present contribution to tbe retirement fund just as. though be and tbe State bad contributed it year by year for tbe years of required service under tbe retirement system. It was tbe equivalent of a personal contribution by that member during bis entire term of service. Tbe consideration for tbe transfer from these officials was potentially more than adequate. What we have said here as to such constitutional officers is tbe same as to other employees and officers not in that class, where prior acts were in existence at tbe time of tbe passage of tbe existent Retirement Acts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> to tbe extent that might have been pro<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>vided by such acts. These other instances may not be as strong as the illustration given, but they are sufficiently similar to be analogous and answer the constitutional objection as to such employees.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[285,568,1151,477]]]'>Second, we have indicated in our short history (see note 2, supra), that the systems of pensions, where they were permissible, with retirement pay as here involved, have been created within the past 40 years. To effect a beginning and to obtain the desired result, there must be some date when the system will start and contributions begin. A given year, a fixed, definite day was usually selected. Membership and retirement were in most cases compulsory.</p>

The mass of such employees is usually of those receiving small wages and would generally be unable to make such payment. As a result, the State here required the municipality to contribute a given sum to the board for a future reserve for retirement pay. This appropriation is not to an individual as such, but it is an appropriation to a fund, a part of which the particular employee may or may not receive. With this in view no member of the system or association is in a position to complain about the lack of contribution from other employees for years prior to the act’s effective date. Then, too, there is no legislative prohibition against the amount of the salary that shall be paid to such employee, or when it shall be paid, or the amount of adjusted compensation then to be provided for and paid in the future. This compensation may depend on a long or short service after the effective date of the Retirement Act, as the legislature sees fit.</p>

The record shows there are some 15 out of a possible 2,500 employees starting back in 1916 and running on through, who are now receiving retirement pay and who have contributed relatively small amounts for such compensation. However, the retirement acts are based on the theory of an adjusted compensation for time and service, payable in the future, provided the employee serves the required length of time and reaches the required age.

As to this objection, urged by appellants, that the retirement fund is insolvent,' and, therefore, the mandamus requiring the additional $75,000 to be paid into it should be reversed, it may be said that it is quite possible, as appellee contends, that the insolvency, if it exists, is due to the failure of appellants’ predecessors in office to make the annual payments required by the statute; but the objection is unavailing in any event. The legislature had and has the absolute right to require the county, the state’s subordinate agency, to help support the fund out of moneys over which the state had absolute control ; and the commissioners cannot be heard to excuse their disobedience by saying the state’s action was economically a mistake: in effect, to assure the insolvency upon which they attempt to base their excuse. This being a state matter, explicitly commanded, it can only be changed by action of the state, that is, by a legislative amendment, or by a decree of court on proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the state itself. To allow an agent to refuse to expend a fund of the principal as it directs, solely because the agent, or one employed by it, does not agree with the principal, would reverse all legal concepts — in this case it would make the sovereign subordinate to its subordinates.</p>

This factor is an important one in the relation between state, city and county, as employer, and the employee member, with respect to retirement pay. If a direct attack on it, such as has been made in the present case, is justified, or a weakness in it manifested through actual trial is found to exist, the remedy or relief rests clearly within the relation <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>between employer and employee contemplated by tbe legislative system for retirement pay. The legislature may from time to time, within the confines of that established relation, alter, change, amend, and render intact the actuarial soundness of the system so as to strengthen its fibers in any way it sees fit. Changes in details, such as length of service required, contributions needed, and age requirements, to keep the fund on sound actuarial practices, are essential. Flexibility in component parts is a paramount necessity to guard against changed conditions and to permit keeping abreast with actuarial science. The basis is contribution from the county or state and from employee members.</p>

The legislature, in effect, makes this offer to the employee: The state or municipality will contribute so much money to a fund and you will contribute to the same fund for a given time on the basis of service performed. Conditions or qualifications are added for the benefit of the fund and the employee. The right is given to the employee to cease payment and withdraw from the fund, recovering back his contribution, when his services end, under section 324, Act of 1929. It is difficult to understand where this relation lacks the elements of an executory contract if the employee and the state have directly or indirectly made any payments on account of it. See Lynch v. U. S., supra. The state and its agencies are as certainly bound by their contracts as are individuals.</p>

The legislature so recognizes this principle in that county and elsewhere when it permits the employee to withdraw under given circumstances from the association and take back his contribution as salary. But the funds the county or state contributes are absolutely vested in the system that has been created by it, except the right of withdrawal just discussed. To hold otherwise for the reason that employee contributions are not wages when compulsorily deducted would not only be unfair and unjust, but would circumvent all known equities. Especially is this true when the interest of a <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>retired employee in tlie reserves is denied after his salary has been made to contribute thereto for years, and he is beyond an age when his usefulness as a provider is intact.

The practice had not become a factor in the social sphere. Gradually the necessity for providing compensation to employees who are unable to carry on with the vigor of younger days, became more and more apparent and many years ago great industries and railroads instituted systems of retirement compensation for their employees, so that for more than 30 years retirement pay has been a not uncommon thing with them. The states and municipal governments, realizing that something should be done to ameliorate the conditions of their employees who were serving in nonelective positions, also adopted the retirement system, later reaching out to include those elective officers who had continued in the service of the government for the same period of time as employees, and provided retirement pay for those who were incapacitated from age or other disability, or whose term of service or other cause forced a separation from government employ. The merit of this system cannot be doubted: persons reaching a given age who have been long in the service of the government, an age at which no other useful employment is open to them, should be protected and cared for by the governmental agency in whose behalf they have so long labored.</p>
