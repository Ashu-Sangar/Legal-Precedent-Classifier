The property was originally on a level with the grade of the surrounding streets. After the grade was completed, the street was raised from 4% to 9 feet, the connecting streets being raised to conform to the new grade of the principal thoroughfares. The result was to leave appellee’s property in a hollow, making it impracticable to use it either for plant, residence or other purposes unless it was made to conform to the new grade. The cost of doing the latter work, if carried out, would have approximated'$250,000.</p>

He also stated that he knew the cost of two pieces of land which formed a part of that affected by the change. His description of appellee’s holdings was thorough and in detail. Without any further effort to ascertain his knowledge of the values of real estate in the vicinity, and whether he could express an opinion as to market valué, he was asked what was, in his opinion, “the market value of the property involved in this case as a whole before the raising of the streets.” The question was objected to because the witness was incompetent to testify. Had the objection been sustained, it would have forced appellee to a more extensive examination of this witness and no doubt his qualifications could have been shown. Had the objection been overruled, without more, or had it been suggested to counsel to cross-examine as to qualifications, appellant would have been in no position to complain. In either case he was required to cross-examine the witness as to his competency: Hoffman v. B. W. Coal Mining Co., <a href="/pa/265/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="265 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="1051838" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0476-01">265 Pa. 476</a>. But counsel were asked: “Do you have any authority for saying that an executive officer of the owning corporation is incompetent to testify? It is my im<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>pression he is.” Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Phila., <a href="/pa/246/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="246 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1006175" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0084-01">246 Pa. 84</a>, was a case where the court below excluded the testimony of the president of an ice company on the ground that the “witness had not been shown to be an expert in real estate values.” On appeal we said, at page 88, that his testimony was not improperly excluded. “When the case is again tried it will be proper to show his competency as a witness familiar with the value of the property before and after the change of grade, and when this is done, if it be satisfactorily done, there can be no question as to his right to testify.” An examination of that case shows that he was president of a very small company. Mr. Rowan was not the owner of property; the Air Brake Company is a very large corporation owning-large areas of ground, and it becomes a matter of moment to ascertain that Rowan, its president, and a very important witness, knew sufficient of real estate values to enable him to testify.</p>
    <p id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[268,1323,1152,685]]]'>In permitting the president to testify as an owner he was placed in a special class of witnesses. It was immaterial then how much appellant might cross-examine, his lack of knowledge of real estate values would have been immaterial. As an owner he would have been a competent witness on the record before us. He had shown a sufficient familiarity with his plant, its location and business to qualify him, but this court has placed officers of corporations in the same category as witnesses other than the owner. As Rowan was but one of three witnesses as to value without having special qualifications, unless we overrule Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Phila., <a href="/pa/246/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="246 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1006175" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0084-01">supra,</a> this case must be reversed.</p>

Without this comparative evidence, an option price given some years before might be much higher than <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>the value of the property at the time of the taking.

    <p id="b407-3" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[166,513,1155,1184]]]'>We discuss briefly the remaining objections. After Bowan had testified as to value, he was asked in cross-examination to state whether he did not carry the property on the books of the company at $1,114,067.50, and not at $1,400,000. Having replied in the affirmative, he was asked if he did not use the former figure for tax purposes, with the further suggestion that the book value was used to avoid income tax. These questions were highly improper. The witness in his examination in chief had shown no basis for such cross-examination (Wissinger v. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/271/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="271 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="295715" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0566-01">271 Pa. 566</a>), and had it been objected to, it should have been disallowed. It was an attempt to inject an idea into the case wholly foreign to the real issue. Not having been objected to, it was perfectly proper, after the assault that had been made on the witness’s testimony in chief, to ask the question in redirect examination which was asked by appellee’s counsel. The answer was nothing more than what could have been expected had the witness been asked as to a particular sale of a property. It was then the duty of appellant to cross-examine the witness as to whether the option price represented the fair market price.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[166,1708,1155,205]]]'>Appellant has argued that the option price was submitted as evidence in chief. Counsel are mistaken, as the record shows. It was in redirect examination, and, as we have indicated, proper under the circumstances.</p>

Here is a piece of land formerly level with the street. The latter was raised from four to nine feet, interfering seriously with the renting of the property during the work of construction, and appellee did by this lose a large sum of money. Of course, appellant is not liable for all that loss, and the loss of rents cannot be shown as an independent item of damages, but it is an element to be considered in market value: Forster v.
