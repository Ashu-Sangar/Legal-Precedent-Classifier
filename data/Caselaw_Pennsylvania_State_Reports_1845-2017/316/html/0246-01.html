Heck were married. He was then a widower 74 years of age and possessed of an estate which he now says was then worth between $30,000 and $50,000. She was a widow 63 years of age and was possessed of a much larger estate. Some time previously, Edward B. Scull, Esq., then and now a deservedly prominent member of the bar, on instructions from Mrs. Heck, had drawn an antenuptial agreement to be executed by herself and her intended husband, and the day before their marriage they called at Mr. Scull’s office to execute ■ it. Mr. Scull handed it to appellant, who read it through slowly, and with meticulous care. After he had thus read it, Mr. Scull asked him if it was all right, and appellant said “Yes.” Then Mr. Scull said to both of them: “Now do you have each the understanding of the other’s property, that enables you to say that this is a fair contract between you?” They both said they had such an understanding of it. A question then came up regarding the recording of the antenuptial agreement. When considering that question Mr. Scull says he said to them: “ ‘This is important because of the fact that <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>Mrs. McCready [as she afterwards became] is a large real estate owner; she has a very large amount of real estate, and she is interested in 18 or 20 pieces of real estate, along with her brothers and sisters, being a one-sixth interest in the Joseph W. Craig'Estate’......and when I was enumerating those properties the Doctor [appellant] interrupted me by saying in effect ‘Probably I know more about her property than you do’; and so [Mr. Scull] said I also thought that was probable and I discontinued mentioning anything about it.” A notary public was then sent for and the antenuptial agreement was executed in triplicate in the presence of and was witnessed by Mr. Scull, his secretary and the notary public, and was. acknowledged by appellant and testatrix before the notary. Neither of the parties wished the agreement to be recorded, because, as they said, it was a matter with which the public was not concerned; so Mr. Scull drew an additional agreement, covering the properties in which Mrs. McCready had an undivided interest, and the next day, after the. wedding, the two of them called at Mr. Scull’s office and executed and acknowledged it.</p>

    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[185,450,1155,1622]]]'>On June 21, 1933, testatrix died and left appellant a legacy of $1,000 a month “so long as he shall live, the first payment to be made on the first day of the first calendar month succeeding my decease.” Nevertheless, and despite his covenant and agreement above quoted, he executed, acknowledged and recorded an election “to accept the legal alternative of taking under and according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania instead of under [her] will.” The parties in interest under the will thereupon instituted the present proceeding, praying that his said election “be annulled and declared of no effect to the .same intent and effect as though it had never been executed and recorded, and that a certified copy of the decree be registered with the Register of Deeds for the City of Pittsburgh and of said Allegheny County and with any other proper authority empowered to keep a register of real estate in and for said County and City, and be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and that the Register of Wills and Clerk of this Court enter on the margin of the record of the will of said decedent, and on the record at No. 170, July Term, 1933, of this Court, a notation showing the number and term of this proceeding and that the election filed is annulled.” To this an answer was filed, followed by petitioners’ replication, a trial in due course, and an adjudication in favor of granting the prayer of the petition. Respondent filed exceptions thereto, which, after argument, were dismissed, and a decree entered as reported by the trial judge. The present appeal was then taken.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[187,2082,1152,323]],["BL_280.1",280,[256,342,1160,1622]]]'>At no time, not even during this contest, did appellant state that he did not understand the antenuptial agreement. He insisted at the trial that it was not executed until after the marriage, but the evidence against that claim was so overwhelming that, in his brief in this court, it has been abandoned. He also claimed that <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>he thought it was only a temporary expedient to cover the period of a wedding trip he and testatrix were about to take. Its language is such, however, that no one of even ordinary intelligence could have so thought. At the time he executed the agreement, he says in his answer, he had been practicing his profession for upwards of half a century, and was “in full flush of mental and physical vigor.” It is clear, therefore, that when, “slowly and with meticulous care,” he read the language of the agreement, which stated that “he has such full knowledge of the property and estate of [his intended wife] as to allow [him] to enter into this agreement with full knowledge that its provisions may be to [his] financial disadvantage,” he knew full well what he was then representing to her and the others present, and hence the court below properly found that “judging by his degree of intelligence he understood its meaning,”— a conclusion also necessitated by his statement then made to Mr. Scull’s secretary: “I don’t want any of Daisie’s [his intended wife’s] money.” If, then, knowing the meaning of the words in the agreement, he none the less signed and delivered it, and, on the faith of his so doing, testatrix married him, he cannot now be heard to contend, after she is dead, that she married him in the belief that he did not waive the right to claim, in case she predeceased him, in antagonism to her testamentary provisions. This conclusion is alone sufficient to require a dismissal of the present appeal, but we prefer, in respect to the elaborate brief of appellant’s counsel, to proceed a little further.</p>
    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[252,1975,1155,425]],["BL_281.1",281,[180,353,1158,689]]]'>So far as this record discloses, the subject-matter of the antenuptial agreement came up but once thereafter. Some eight years after it was executed, appellant sold one of his properties, and desired testatrix to join with him in a deed to the purchaser. This she was not willing to do without ascertaining from Mr. Scull whether or not her doing so would affect the antenuptial agreement. Testatrix, appellant and the purchaser <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>thereupon called on Mr. Scull in regard to the matter. She said to him “I have refused to sign that deed for fear it might interfere with our agreement with regard to managing our property, and I told the doctor [appellant] ‘I would not sign it unless I had your advice in regard to it.’ ” Mr. Scull advised her to sign it “because, ......instead of being against her interest, it was simply carrying out the agreement.” She thereupon signed it and appellant and the purchaser settled for the sale. Appellant does not directly dispute this incident, though he claims that he never heard of the antenuptial agreement, from the time it was executed, until after testatrix’s death.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[185,1063,1152,535]]]'>Appellant seems to think that if he can, by constant repetition, induce the court to believe that he did not know the exact value of testatrix’s estate at the time he executed the antenuptial agreement, that fact alone will require the striking down of the agreement. The law is not so. In some respects, every contest in this class of agreements is unique. In each, all of the relevant facts must be grouped together, and, when considered in bulk, the court must determine whether or not the party objecting has a just right to complain.</p>

This was a marriage between persons well advanced in years. The appellant was not the mother of his children, nor was she likely ever to bear him any. She had not in any way aided him to accumulate his fortune. She had $12,000 of her own, all of which he relinquished. In addition he gave her $600 per year during her life. What claim had this old woman, marrying this old man, to come in and take one third of his estate away from his children, and yet retain the whole of her own? She would of course have had a legal claim had he married her without an ante-nuptial contract; but she had no claim which made it inequitable or unjust in him to insist upon the execution of the contract before the marriage. It would have been a wrong to his own blood if he had not made some such arrangement. It was not a liberal provision, but it was adequate. She retains all of her own estate, and has now in addition $600 per year, besides a comfortably furnished home. Surely her last condition is better than her first.</p>

In the latter instance, they grow up together; the wife is the mother of his children; she shares his burdens in his early struggles, and often by her thrift and economy materially aids him in the accumulation of his fortune. To cut off such a wife with a mere support during life would be as unjust as it would be ungenerous. But when a man in the decline of life, who has been twice a widower, and who has two sets of children, for the third time leads a woman to the altar, and an elderly woman at that, it is very different. In such case the wife reaps where she has not sown, and, if she is provided with a comfortable support after hftr hus<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>band’s death, she has no just cause of complaint.
