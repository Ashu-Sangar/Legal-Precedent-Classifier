Of the use the people may make of this unrestrained power, it is not the business of the courts to inquire.

It is first said that the statute violates article II, section 1, vesting legislative power in the General Assembly ; that, by empowering the county commissioners to take the steps necessary to obtain the charter for Allegheny County Authority, legislative power was delegated. The legislature has made the law permitting organization of the corporation in certain circumstances. No power to make the law was delegated to the county commissioners; all that remained for them to do, was to find a fact from which they should determine whether to act or not, i. e., whether it was desirable to take advantage of the law in accord with its provisions. If they decided in the affirmative, it was then necessary to comply with the statute to bring the corporation into existence. The cases relied on by plaintiff are not inconsistent with this view; their facts are so different from those in this record, as to illustrate clearly why the statute is not repugnant to the section in question. In Pittsburgh’s Petition, <a href="/pa/138/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="138 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="11252075" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0401-01">138 Pa. 401</a>, 430, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20757" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="21 A. 757">21 A. 757</a>, the statute was condemned because it authorized the city councils to legislate by creating new departments in the city government and to define their powers, matters which we were required to say “the legislature must settle......” In O’Neil v.

      <em>2: </em>Article III, section 7, prohibits “any local or special law:......Regulating the affairs of counties, cities, <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>townships, wards, boroughs or school districts.” It is said that, as there is at the moment only one county of the second class, the legislation was intended for that county and is, therefore, local or special. The contention is inconsistent with the constitutional amendment of 1923, now section 34 of article III. It declares that “The legislature shall have power to classify counties, cities, boroughs, school districts and townships according to population and all laws passed relating to each class ......shall be deemed general legislation within the meaning of this Constitution.” The provisions of Act No. 30 are general and apply to all counties of the second class as classified by the legislature pursuant to the amendment.

Article III, section 20, provides that “The General Assembly shall not delegate to any special commission, private corporation or association, any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects, whether held in trust or otherwise, or to levy taxes or perform any municipal function whatever.” Allegheny County Authority is, as section 1 of the statute provides, “a public body corporate and politic of said county for the public purposes herein set forth and shall exercise an essential governmental function.” Plaintiff’s first objection, under this head, suggests that Allegheny County Authority is either <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>a special.commission or a private corporation or association, and, therefore, within the prohibition.

The separation of the power to incur debts from the duty of providing for their payment by taxation, produced the principal mischief complained of and which it was sought to prevent. Notorious examples were the Public Buildings Commission, created to build the city hall in Philadelphia, Act of August 5, 1870, 1871 P. L. 1548 (Perkins v.

The subject was considered by the convention with particular reference to the experience of these two cities (Debates, volume 2, page 697 et seq.), and that experience illustrates the character of legislative interference with local government that was intended to be prevented. It cannot be said that the creation of a public corporation as a state agency to take over public highways for the limited purpose of improving them, paying for the improvement out of revenues collected for their use, and then returning them to the local political subdivisions to which they had formerly been entrusted by the state, is a special commission, in any sense in which those words were used in the constitution, either in substance <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>or spirit. And, it need hardly be added that the designed use of the words “private corporation” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> cannot include “ a public body corporate and politic of said county,” under the rule that the expression of one thing excludes what is not expressed.

Allegheny County Authority, as the agent created for the purpose by the State, deals not with property owned by the municipality, but with the highway system of the Commonwealth as to which, as we have repeatedly held, the power of the state is supreme, and this makes it immaterial that the trustee, under the trust indenture, The Colonial Trust Company of Pittsburgh, may enter for the purpose of collecting tolls or otherwise in the event of default by the Authority.

As mere doubt of constitutionality is not <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>sufficient (Gottschall v.

Plaintiff suggests that, by giving up, during the period of the trust indenture, the use of free highways and substituting toll highways, the county and the municipalities are appropriating money to the Authority. The suggestion must be rejected. Tolls for the use of a highway are not taxes: Ruler v.

The constitution contains no prohibition on the exercise by the State of the power to collect the cost of the highway by direct charge to the users. The history and purpose of the section have been so often stated that they need not be again .repeated.

The next complaint is that the act is repugnant to article IX, section 10, providing “Any county, township, school district or other municipality incurring any indebtedness shall, at or before the time of so doing, provide for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years.” Plaintiff contends that the corporation is a municipality. Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 5th edition, section 32, says: “We may, therefore, define a municipal corporation in its historical and strict sense to be the incorporation, by the authority of the government, of the inhabitants of a particular place or district, and authorizing them in their corporate capacity to exercise' <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>subordinate specified powers of legislation and regulation with respect to their local and internal concerns. This power of local government is the distinctive purpose and the distinguishing feature of a municipal corporation proper.

The state authorized the creation of a public corporation which is denied the power to levy taxes or assessments: section 1 (i) and section 1 (r). The power, conferred in section 1 (i), to borrow money and to issue its bonds or other obligations secured by mortgage or trust deed, is necessarily limited by section 501, expressly denying to the corporation the power “to create any debt of said Commonwealth or of such municipality, county, city, borough or township, and [providing that] the bonds and debts of said ‘Authority’ shall be a lien upon and payable solely from the assets and revenues of said ‘Authority.’ ” As the credit of the county and the municipalities cannot be pledged, the highways and improvements which constitute the project cannot be taken for the debt of the Authority, though <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>they may be controlled for such limited time and extent as may be necessary to pay the debt out of the revenues received, in accordance with the terms of the trust indenture.</p>

Article XV, section 2, provides: “No debt shall be contracted or liability incurred by any municipal commission, except in pursuance of an appropriation previously made therefor by the municipal government.” This restriction is one of those designed to prevent the recurrence of the evils experienced prior to 1873, resulting from the separation of the power to contract debts from the duty of the municipality to raise funds to pay them (Perkins v.

It includes the following: “The debt of any county, city, borough, township, school district, or other municipality or incorporated district, except as provided herein, and in section fifteen of this article, shall never exceed seven (7) per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein,......nor shall any such municipality or district incur any new debt, or increase its indebtedness to an amount exceeding two (2) per centum upon such assessed valuation of property, without the consent of the electors thereof at a public election in such manner as shall be provided by law......” If the proposed bonded indebtedness constitutes a debt within that provision, plaintiff’s bill must, of course, be sustained. In his argument at this point, plaintiff contends that the “creation of the Authority is a fiction designed to evade constitutional limitations on the indebtedness of municipalities” ; that the debt of the Authority is the “debt of the taxpayers of Allegheny County”; that the bonds of the Authority should be considered as “in effect the debt of the county.” It is never an illegal evasion to accomplish a desired result, lawful in itself, by discovering a legal way to do it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We cannot consider the obligation as the debt of the county, unless it is a debt which the county has agreed to pay or can be required to pay. If we understand, as was said in Keller v. Scranton, supra, at 135, that the words “debt and indebtedness in the section in question are not used in any technical way, but in their broad general meaning of all contractual obligation to pay in the future for considerations received in the present,” there is no foundation for plaintiff’s position, because, not only has the county not promised to pay, either expressly or by implication, but the statute clearly provides the method and the only method of obtaining payment. Not only is that true, but, in <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>addition, the statute denies the power to pledge the credit of the county (section 501 supra). This section of article IX, together with sections 7 and 10, already referred to, were among the provisions inserted in the constitution to prevent municipal extravagance such as had been theretofore suffered in the absence of restriction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We are here dealing with the construction of a purely public self-liquidating project. The denial of power to incur liability on the credit of the county or of any municipality is notice to the prospective purchasers of the bonds that their security and their only source of payment will be in the revenues derived from users of the improved highway facilities: see Moore v. City of Nampa, <a href="/us/276/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="276 U.S. 536" data-case-ids="3902307" data-case-paths="/us/276/0536-01">276 U. S. 536</a>. The bondholders cannot call upon the public treasuries to contribute; no county or municipal property can be taken for the debt, because the bondholders have agreed to look to a special fund for payment to be raised in the manner provided. It will be the duty of the defendant corporation to provide adequate tolls and charges. These highways cannot be sold on execution.</p>

We adhere to what was decided in that case. In Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/251/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="251 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1019656" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0028-01">251 Pa. 28</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20938" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="95 A. 938">95 A. 938</a>, the city, under authority to purchase a bridge, acquired it by buying all the capital stock of the corporation owning the bridge (notwithstanding article IX, section 7 of the Constitution, supra). It was held that the bonded debt secured on the bridge at the time the city purchased the stock, must <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>be considered a municipal debt, for, unless it was paid, the city would lose the property. But plaintiff in this case can point to no property that the county or municipalities would lose. It is true that, by the trust indenture, the trustee may enter and collect tolls, if the Authority defaults, but when the debt is paid in that way, the power of the trustee and the Authority is ended, and the property reverts to the public authorities that formerly held it for the State. This difference between a pledge of property and a pledge of income merely, has been said to distinguish a transaction which creates a debt within the constitutional limitation from one creating a debt not within it: City of Bowling Green v.

The language of the amendment is ‘one subject which shall be clearly expressed in the title.’ ‘To be clearly expressed’ certainly does not mean anything which is dubious, and therefore is not clearly expressed.” This was quoted with approval in Provident L. &amp; T. Co. v. Hammond, <a href="/citations/?q=230%20Pa.%20412" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="230 Pa. 412">230 Pa. 412</a>.

This is noted in White on The Constitution of Pennsylvania, page 213, as one of the reasons for the constitutional provision.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[212,726,1151,425]]]'>Turning now to the Act of December 27, 1933, under consideration, the title also has at the end thereof the words “and for other purposes.” For the reason already given those words must be considered as adding nothing to the scope of the statute.

The title states that it is “An Act providing for the creation of public ‘Authorities’ in counties of the second class” etc., etc. Nowhere does it appear in the title what “public authorities” are, and those words, as attempted to be explained by defendants, are and always have been alien to our government, laws and customs. Do they denote a new class of officials for “counties of the second class”? Are they to supersede in whole or in part some of the existing county officials, and, if so, which of them? Or are they to be given new powers and duties in counties of the second class, entirely separate and distinct from those now vested in any county official? These and numerous other cognate questions at once arise when the title alone is considered as, in the light of the constitutional provision under consideration, it must be. It was suggested that this objection is unavailing because in other states there were “public authorities” like that referred to in this act, before our statute was passed, but this does not help. What they were or are does not appear at all in the title to <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>this statute, and nothing appertaining thereto is “clearly expressed” therein. So far as we have been able to discover there is no uniformity in the character of the “public authorities” elsewhere, save in the fact that they are substitutes for other public officials in the performance of some public duties. If the title had been “An Act providing for the creation of public [corporations under the title of] Authorities in counties of the first class” etc., etc., this, with the balance of the title, would possibly have sufficed as respects that which was actually enacted; but the title, as it is, does not “clearly express” the one subject of the act, and hence is fatally bad.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[263,1051,1153,522]]]'>The next clause in the title is also anything but “clear.” It is: “authorizing such ‘Authorities’ to enter into agreements with the Government of the United States, particularly as they [the Agreements?] relate to the National Industrial Recovery Act and any amendments and supplements thereto, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and political subdivisions and municipalities thereof, and with others.” What class of “others”? Public or private? Noseitur a soeiis? The title furnishes no answer.</p>

Attached to the bill as an exhibit, signed by the county commissioners and the Allegheny County Authority, is an agreement by which the county agrees at its “own expense and without cost to the Authority, to provide for and pay all costs of operation, repair and maintenance of said System [including the Fort Duquesne Tunnel and the Liberty Tunnel] other than the cost of supervision and collection of tolls and the overhead costs of the Authority, but including specifically, but without limitation in the costs which the County agrees to and will provide for and pay, the cost of all Insurance, whether maintained by the Authority or by the County, all lighting, sweeping, cleaning and removing snow from <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>structures and approaches, of each and every part of said System [including the Fort Duquesne Tunnel and the Liberty Tunnel], and the cost of policing the same not otherwise provided for and paid by the City of Pittsburgh, the City of McKeesport, and/or the other municipalities, parties in interest.” To plaintiff’s complaint that this may result in increasing the debt of the county beyond the constitutional limitations, the majority answer that “It is said in the briefs that the parties agree ‘that the cost to the county of performing such Agreement will be well within its annual current revenues. On that understanding we sustain the agreement; the costs of operation, repairs and maintenance above described never can exceed the annual current income applicable thereto...... If these annual expenditures are made out of current revenues, the obligation to make them is not a debt within the constitutional sense.” It is conceded, of course, that if in any year the expense referred to, together with all other expenses properly chargeable against current revenues, do not exceed the total thereof, both may be paid therefrom and the debt will not be increased. The agreement itself does not refer to the current revenues, however, but is an out and out promise to pay under any and all circumstances. It may be that ordinarily the expenses on this account would not exceed the surplus of the current revenues, but it is equally possible that at some time they would be too great, as for instance in case a bridge, after complete construction, but before being turned over to the county, should be wholly destroyed from any cause. What then? Under this contract, if sustained by the courts, the county would have to borrow money to pay for the reconstruction, and then the question of the constitutional limitation of debt would at once arise.</p>

The Act of December 27,1933, under consideration, does not provide that the county shall contract to pay or shall pay such maintenance and expenses, — indeed does not refer to the matter <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>at all; and we have been referred to no other statute placing such a liability on the county. So far as appears the agreement was prepared by the federal emergency administration of public works, which is not referred to in the Act of 1933, or given any authority to place such an expenditure on the county.</p>
    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[273,667,1153,1019]]]'>If there can be found somewhere an authority for the county commissioners to make such a contract, then, of course, that authority will necessarily be limited by the constitutional provision regarding the maximum amount of the county’s debt, and the question of constitutionality at once becomes important. To us it is clear that in so far as compliance with the contract does or may violate the constitutional inhibition the contract must fall. Where it does not appear in figures what a public corporation’s possible liability may be in a project which it seeks to enter into, but where, by the terms of its undertaking, its debt may be increased beyond the constitutional limit, the possibility of such an increase must be taken into account by the court in determining whether thereby the constitution may be violated, and where, as here, the ultimate expenditures of the county, under the contract, may exceed the debt limit, it is our duty to halt the project so that possible constitutional infringement may not take place.</p>

Since the Act of 1933 does not provide that the county should make such payments out of the current revenues or otherwise, the maintenance agreement providing therefor would seem to be an afterthought without any legislative action to support it and hence illegal.</p>
