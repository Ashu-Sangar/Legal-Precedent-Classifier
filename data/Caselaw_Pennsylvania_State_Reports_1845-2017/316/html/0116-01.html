Pursuant to the lease, he deposited that sum in a saving fund account, opened September 11, 1930, by a check drawn on his checking account in defendant bank. On the face of the transaction with the bank, there was nothing to indicate that anyone but Johnson was interested in the account, and the bank had no reason to suspect that fact until sometime in January, 1932. During that period Johnson’s average daily indebtedness was $46,238.23, ranging from a low of $30,000 to a high of $50,000. The relation between Johnson and the bank was debtor and creditor, and, when notice of appellant’s claim was received in January, 1932, his debts exceeded the amounts to his credit.

    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[204,716,1156,1025]]]'>The lease required the lessee to deposit $15,000 in cash with Johnson, who agreed to deposit it to his credit in a separate saving fund account in a bank to be selected by him; to pay the lessee the interest received on it at the prevailing rate; to hold the amount as security for the payment of rent, with the right, on default, to apply the deposit to rent in arrear, or other damages, and, also, with the option in the lessor to apply the security toward the payment of the last installments of rent; the lessor also agreed to exhibit to the lessee, when required, a saving fund book showing the deposit of $15,000 to the credit of the lessor, and, if at any time the lessor was unable to do that, the lessee could withhold rent in the amount deposited, or in such amount as the deposit was short. It was also agreed that, if at the end of the term there was no default, the deposit should be repaid to the lessee.

While, of course, money may be paid to a lessor as security, in circumstances and under terms which would establish a trust, the lease in this record did not so provide. The money was paid to Johnson as security, without limiting his use and control of it in such way as to create a trust. He was not <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>required, at all events, to maintain the $15,000 deposit; he was to deposit the money without restriction or earmark, leaving him in position to use it as he chose. If he disbursed it for his own purposes, the parties agreed, he should not be guilty of conversion; lessee’s only remedy was to withhold rent. The purpose of the provision requiring him to exhibit his saving fund book, seems, on the one hand, to have been to satisfy the lessee, before paying additional rent, that the lessor would be able to return the security, and, on the other hand, to preclude the lessee from claiming that the security had been dissipated and that he was therefore relieved of the obligation to pay rent when the deposit was restored.
