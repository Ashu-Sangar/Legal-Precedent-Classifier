This firm maintained offices in New York, Boston and Chicago, and branch offices in other cities including Pittsburgh, where its office was, from July 1, 1930, in charge of a manager named Gilliland. The firm was registered under the Fictitious Names Act of June 28,1917, P. L. 645, 54 P. S., section 21, the names and residences of all the partners being listed and the fact that Gilliland,was the firm’s agent in Allegheny County being certified. On June 28, 1932, while this agent was in the Pittsburgh office, a deputy sheriff served him with a summons in a suit in trespass against the firm. The Acts of April 2,1856, P.

Defendants filed a petition stating that they were nonresidents, that Gilliland had ceased to be in their employ on and after June 15th, that on that date they had ceased to do business in Allegheny County, that the court was without jurisdiction over them, and that the attempted service was null and void. This petition was unavailing. Hence this appeal.</p>

A corporation to be known as Lee Higginson Corporation, with its capital paid in from sources outside the present partnership, is presently to be formed to engage in the securities business with offices in New York, Boston and Chicago. The assets of Lee, Higginson &amp; Company will remain with the partnership, and following the formation of the new corporation the firm will devote itself to the protection and eventual liquidation of its assets and to the handling of its existing acceptance business.” The firm claimed that on June 15, 1932, it closed all of its offices, its purpose being to withdraw from the securities business, except the offices in New York, Boston and Chi<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>cago, which were kept open for the purpose of completing pending transactions and protecting assets. It was testified by one of the partners that the managers of the branch offices, including the one in Pittsburgh, were notified, on or before June 15,1932, that the firm had determined to withdraw from business and instructed them to close the branch offices on June 15,1932, and to notify the other employees that their employment with the firm terminated on that date. The rent for the office in Pittsburgh was paid until August 29, 1932, when the firm secured the cancellation of its lease. The Pittsburgh manager was paid a salary to June 15,1932, and then he and the other employees were paid additional amounts equivalent to another one-half month’s salary. This was characterized by defendants’ witnesses as “extra compensation for lack of preliminary notice of the termination of employment.” During the latter part of June, 1932, and the early part of July, 1932, the manager sold furniture which was in the firm’s office in Pittsburgh and forwarded to the firm’s New York office the checks received therefor.</p>

The court also found that Gilliland not only sold the office furniture for the defendants and remitted the proceeds, after June 15, 1932, but he also collected the licenses of defendants’ agents in Pittsburgh and forwarded them to defendants, that he closed two bank accounts of defendants and transmitted the amount to them, and that he shipped to defendants files and records after June 15, 1932, and arranged for the cancellation of the telephone contract as of July 1,1932. The court also found from the evidence that “to all outward appearances defendants were doing business in Allegheny County on June 28, 1932, as they <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>had been for years theretofore, and Gilliland was in outward possession of their office as their agent and representative.”</p>

No provisions of the statute pertain to service of process on either residents or nonresidents.”</p>

The American Law Institute in “Restatement of the Law of Agency,” volume 1, section 1, page 7, lays down the following definitions of <em>Agency: </em>“(1) Agency is the relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act. (2) The one for whom action is to be taken is the principal. (3) The one who is to act is the agent.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The term <em>agent </em>is custom<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>arily defined as one who has been entrusted with the business of another. Gilliland was the person these defendants said “shall act on their behalf and subject to their control,” in Allegheny County, in matters relating to the principals’ business. He therefore answers the description of an “agent” upon whom, under the Acts of 1856 and 1858, supra, service was properly had in the suit against these nonresident principals. As their duly selected agent, he was presumably vigilant in guarding their interests, and, being so, would notify the defendants of the summons served upon him. This in fact he did.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[275,955,1155,960]]]'>The “agent” on whom service may be made effectually does not have to be described as “an attorney in fact,” or as a “special agent,” or as “an agent on whom process may be served,” nor does any of his “authority” have to be expressed. It is sufficient for a valid service under the Acts of 1856 and 1858, supra, that he has the name or character of “agent,” in the appropriate territory, of the defendants against whom the writ has been directed. Appellants say it is “doubtful whether they were required to register under the Fictitious Names Act” and that this act has nothing to do with substituted service. The answer to that is that Gilliland would be equally subject to service of this writ, as defendants’ agent, even if there had been no designation of him as such under the Fictitious Names Act or if there had been no such act. He was their agent <em>in fact </em>when he was served on June 28, 1932. His being registered as such merely facilitates the proof.</p>

Appellants contend that it does. Their proposition is that the service ivas “not good” even if defendants had continued to do business in Allegheny County and Gilliland had continued in their employ to and including the date of service. They argue: “The defendants were nonresidents of the Commonwealth. They were not served with process. A nonresident absent individual does not become amenable to a court in Pennsylvania in an action in personam without service upon him even if he does do business in Pennsylvania through his agents or employees. Our legislature is without constitutional power to enact a statute purporting to place nonresident individuals under the jurisdiction of our courts when such individuals are not served and are geographically beyond the reach of process. Assent to a statutory substituted or constructive service intended to create jurisdiction in personam, when in fact such jurisdiction does not exist, cannot be made a condition of doing business within the State. Nonresident individuals, unlike foreign corporations, are citizens and as such have an absolute right to do business in a lawful manner in every state, and submission to suit in personam without any effectual service of process cannot be compelled by statute.”</p>

All constitutional and statutory rights must be exercised with due regard for the regulations of the sovereign of the place of exercise. Even the so-called “fundamental right” to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not absolute but relative. If appellants mean simply to invoke the right of citizens of other states to do business in this Commonwealth “in a lawful manner,” the answer is that that right is unchallenged on this record, but the point is made that they were doing business in this Commonwealth “in a lawful manner” only when they complied with the Fictitious Names Act of 1917 by designating an agent and by here submitting through this agent to the service of judicial process as the laws of this Commonwealth prescribe. We hold that none of these statutes infringe upon the due process clause of the federal Constitution.</p>

Such corporations are within the state, receiving the protection of its laws, and may and often do have large properties located within the state.” The Supreme Court in that case upheld the right of Kentucky to require a corporation engaged in purely interstate commerce as a condition of doing business there, to designate an agent upon whom process could be served. It <em>rejected </em>as “novel” and without judicial support the proposition that “as long as a foreign corporation engages in interstate commerce only, it is immune from the service of process under the laws of the state in which it is carrying on such business.”</p>

The answer to that is that such requirements are not in their essence <em>“police </em>regulations” but <em>procedural </em>regulations. A state protects its citizens from reckless motorists <em>primarily </em>by penal laws, making the negligent operation of motor vehicles a crime. Penal laws serve the public safety better than civil procedures or regulations, for, in criminal prosecutions growing out of fatal or nonfatal injuries to its inhabitants, the defense of contributory negligence is not available, whereas, in civil suits for damages caused by negligent operation of motor vehicles, contributory negligence is a defense. Laws like the Massachusetts statute and New Jersey statute which were reviewed in the last two cases cited, are designed by the states enacting them to enable their injured citizens to maintain actions <em>in their own courts </em>against citizens of other states who, by negligent operation of motor vehicles, inflicted injuries upon them.</p>

S. 289</a>: This was an action brought in Illinois by the plaintiff in error for money upon a judgment rendered by a court in Kentucky. Defendants were doing business in the latter state as partners through Flexner. The defendant Farson was the only one served with a process, and he pleaded that the defendants in the former suit did not reside in Kentucky, were not served with process and did not appear, and that Flexner was not their agent at the time of service upon him, that the Kentucky statute relied upon was unconstitutional, and that the Kentucky court had no jurisdiction and, therefore, its judgment was void. The plaintiff demurred to the pleas and stood upon his demurrer when it was overruled, whereupon judgment was entered for the defendants. The judgment of the court below was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes, who stated: “It is said that the defendants by doing business in the state consented to be bound by the service prescribed. The analogy of suits against insurance companies based upon such service is invoked: Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn. v. Phelps, <a href="/us/190/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="190 U.S. 147" data-case-ids="8296525" data-case-paths="/us/190/0147-01">190 U. S. 147</a>. But the consent that is said to be implied in such cases is a mere fiction, founded upon the accepted doctrine that the states could exclude foreign corporations altogether, and therefore could establish this obligation as a condition to letting them in....... The state had no power to exclude the defendants and on that ground without going farther the Supreme Court of Illinois rightly held <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>that the analogy failed, and that the Kentucky judgment was void.” We think it was not necessary for the determination of the question of validity of service for the court in that case to decide that the Kentucky act was unconstitutional, because the plaintiff, in demurring to the pleas, admitted that Flexner was not defendants’ agent at the time service was made upon him. This alone rendered the service invalid and the judgment a nullity. .Secondly, we believe the decision has been in effect overruled in Hess v. Pawloski, <a href="/us/274/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="274 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="81168" data-case-paths="/us/274/0352-01">274 U. S. 352</a>.

In 1368, Edward III was petitioned by the House of Commons that “presentments before his justices be made only by due process according to the ancient law of the land.” This petition was granted “because this is an article of the Great Charter.”</p>

Farson Case, said in his address, “The Path of the Law,” Harvard Law Review, volume X, 457: “The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of logic. And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man. Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You always can imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it ? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some opinion as to policy, or, in short, because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battle grounds where the means do not exist for determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place. We do not realize how large a part of our law is open to reconsideration upon' a slight change in the habit of the public mind.”</p>
