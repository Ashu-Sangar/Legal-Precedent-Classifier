But here there is nothing but the deposit of the money, not even with the trustee named in the indenture, but in a bank which had no relation either to the corporation or the bondholders. The situation is the same as in any other instance where a debtor has deposited money in a bank to meet a claim of a creditor, as in Cheney v. Libby, <a href="/us/134/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="134 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="8299091" data-case-paths="/us/134/0068-01">134 U.

There is such a difference between that case and this on their facts that as a precedent ruling the present controversy we must disregard it. There funds were deposited by the State of Illinois with the bank in a special ac<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>count to pay interest coupons on canal company stock for which the state was liable. The coupons were in the form of an order on the bank to pay a specified sum to bearer. A general deposit account of the State in the bank was overdrawn and the bank resisted the claim of a coupon holder for payment on the ground that there were no funds available to pay the coupons. We did not pass upon the question whether the State could withdraw the money it had deposited to pay the coupons, but determined that as long as the deposit was permitted to remain in the bank’s hands for the specific purpose, it would be a breach of trust on its part to appropriate the fund to any other purpose and to deny a coupon holder the right to receive his aliquot part of it. There the bank was resisting payment to a coupon holder, here the depositing corporation is demanding the money to its credit in the bank.</p>
    <p id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[253,1268,1153,748]]]'>The coupons in the instant case were payable by the corporation “at its office or financial agency in the City of Philadelphia.” They were not payable out of any trust fund or even by the trustee under the mortgage, but by the corporation itself. When each deposit was made the corporation simply authorized the bank to pay for the account of the corporation such maturing coupons as should be presented. No trust relation was thus created, only that which ordinarily exists between a bank and a depositor, that of debtor and creditor. If the bank had failed under the situation here existing, with coupons unpaid, it is clear that the loss would have fallen on the Lake Superior Corporation, not on the coupon holders.</p>
