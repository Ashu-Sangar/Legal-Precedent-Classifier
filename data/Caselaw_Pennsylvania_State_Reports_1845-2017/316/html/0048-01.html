He had been in possession of the property for thirteen years under a continuing monthly lease, which imposed upon him the obligation to keep the premises in good order and repair. The City of Philadelphia by sci, fa. brought Harry Briggs and Germantown Trust Company in as additional defendants. On the trial the court gave binding instructions in favor of the trust company and the jury rendered a verdict in its favor. It found for the plaintiffs against the city in the sum of $1,200, and in favor of the city against Harry Briggs for a like sum. Judgments were entered on the verdicts, and, from the one in favor of the Germantown Trust Company the city appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the judgment in the trust company’s favor and awarded a <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>new trial.

The trial judge refused the offers.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[281,1063,1155,630]]]'>It was upon this ruling that the Superior Court reversed the judgment in favor of the trust company, stating, as its view, that if the testimony should be sufficient to show actual notice to the owner of the alleged nuisance, this would have been adequate to warrant recovery over by the city from the trust company of the damages assessed against the former. The Superior Court reached its conclusion from a consideration of an ordinance passed by the city on May 3, 1855, from the provisions of the Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, section 11, 53 P. S. section 771, and from certain of our and its own cases.</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.7",78,[280,1713,1152,587]]]'>The ordinance provides: “The footways of all public streets and highways, and the cartways and footways of all private streets, shall be graded, paved and curbed and kept in repair, at the expense of the owners of ground fronting thereon.” The Act of 1891, section 11, authorizes municipal authorities to require sidewalks to be laid and kept in repair and after notice from the municipality to the owner to do the work, and upon his failure to comply, to do the work itself and assess the cost upon the owner and file a lien therefor or collect the same by action of assumpsit.</p>

Whether or not we agree with these general observations, which seem to us to be the foundations for that court’s conclusion, we think they are not pertinent to the inquiry which this case develops. We are not confronted with notice by the city to the property owner (when that situation arises will be time to conclude about its effect), but with alleged notice by a tenant who was himself bound to make the repair. A tenant cannot shift responsibility to his landlord in this way nor can the city acquire any advantage against the owner because of the action of his tenant.</p>

Such notice can have no effect because the tenant cannot relieve himself from his duty and responsibility by giving it. The ordinance and the Act of Assembly of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, section 11, 53 P. S. section 771, referred to by the Superior Court have no bearing on the matter of notice by the tenant to his landlord; they simply fix the duty of the owner so far as the maintenance of <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>sidewalks is concerned, and prescribe the remedies of the city against Mm if he fails to fulfill it, — that the city may do the work and recover the expense from the property or from him personally. They do not deal in any manner with the city’s right to recover from him damages which may in the first instance be recovered from it: Newcastle v.

No ordinance and no statute requires “notice <em>from the municipality </em>to the owner,” to make the latter <em>liable in tort. </em>The Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, section 11, provides: “The municipal authorities may require......sidewalks ......to be......kept in repair, and after notice to the owner......to......repair such walks and stone in front of his, her or their property, said municipal authorities may do the necessary work and assess the <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>cost thereof <em>upon the property </em>of said owner or owners in front of or along which said walk......so...... repaired, shall be situate, and <em>file a lien </em>therefor or collect the same by action of assumpsit.” The Philadelphia city ordinance of May 3, 1855, provides as follows : “The footways of all public streets and highways ......shall be......kept in repair, at the expense of the owners of ground fronting thereon.” There is thus clearly imposed by law a duty on the person designated, to wit, the owner of the fronting ground. Here that means the Germantown Trust Company. Where a public duty is ignored and injury is the consequence, there follows liability in tort. When one owes the public a duty to act, he is not ordinarily relieved of his duty by contracting with another to perform it. I think the Superior Court was right in its statement that “the public duty of the lessor is not divested by making a lease, it is only <em>qualified </em>by requiring notice of the defect on account of his nonoccupancy: Lindstrom v. Penna. Co., <a href="/pa/212/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="212 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="941893" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0391-01">212 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.%20940" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="61 A. 940">61 A. 940</a>; Ashley v.

A general command from one legally <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>authorized to give it must be obeyed by all persons under the compulsion of obedience to that command. The notice to repair provided for in the Act of 1891 is a notice the municipality must give before <em>it can do the worlc itself </em>(upon the owner’s failure to comply with the notice given) <em>and assess the cost against him and collect the same by action of assumpsit. </em>That notice is prerequisite to the exercise of a procedural right and not a prerequisite to the performance of a public duty by an abutting property owner. “In the case of borough sidewalks, the owners of property are required by law to keep their footways in repair......This is a duty imposed directly upon the property owner, and is in the nature of a police regulation”: Wilkinsburg Boro. v. Home for Aged Women, <a href="/pa/131/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="131 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="810277" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0109-01">131 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20937" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="18 A. 937">18 A. 937</a>. “An ordinance requiring lot owners to lay sidewalks is a police regulation. A duty is imposed, the neglect of which creates a liability — if it be so ordained — to the municipality for the cost it has been put to in doing that which he [the lot owner] ought to have done”: Pittsburgh v. Daly, <a href="/pa-super/5/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="5 Pa. Super. 528" data-case-ids="279999" data-case-paths="/pa-super/5/0528-01">5 Pa. Superior Ct. 528</a>.</p>

The “notice” referred to in Ashley v. Lehigh &amp; Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. (supra), and other cases, was not restricted by making it a notice from any certain source. Notice means knowledge or information; whatever puts one upon inquiry amounts to notice. See Words &amp; Phrases, 1st edition, volume 5, page 4840. For example, if one was charged with receiving stolen goods “knowing they were stolen,” it would be no defense that while he had actual knowledge that the goods were stolen he did not have that knowledge <em>from the thief. </em>Proof that the Germantown Trust Company had actual notice that the sidewalk was in disrepair should have been received. Its duty to the public to keep that sidewalk in repair <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>was not a somnolent one which could be galvanized into legal life only by a notice <em>from the municipality.</em>

Harvey, <a href="/pa/105/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="105 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="454292" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0222-01">105 Pa. 222</a>. In that case it was clear from the context that the word “owner” in the statute there being interpreted clearly meant the person in possession as distinguished from the owner of the fee. Justice Paxson said that the “reasonable construction” of the act imposing “upon the owners, superintendents or managers of factories” the duty of providing fire-escapes, was that by owner was meant “the occupant in possession, who places the operatives in a position of danger and enjoys the benefit of their success.”</p>
