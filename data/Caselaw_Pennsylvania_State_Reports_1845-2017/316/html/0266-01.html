On April 15, 1925, the bridge company sublet the work of building the approaches and substructure to H. B. Mish Company. On May 22, 1925, H. B. Mish Company and The iEtna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, appellant, delivered to the bridge company a bond conditioned that Mish perform and complete the subcontract, and containing, inter alia, the following: “......it is hereby further stipulated and agreed that the said principal and said surety jointly and severally further covenant and agree with said Independent Bridge Company that any person or persons having a claim for any sum alleged to be due by said principal for any labor or materials furnished in or about the construction of said contract, which shall have remained unpaid for a period of sixty days after the completion and performance of the above mentioned contract and acceptance by the two counties of the work done thereunder, shall have the right to bring suit upon this obligation and to recover any sums as may be justly and legally due him or them. Such suits may be brought in the name of the Independent Bridge Company for the use of the person or persons having such claim......”</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>James Ainsley, the appellee, sued in the name of the bridge company for his use, to recover for certain coal sold and delivered by him to Mish, which was consumed in firing the boilers, and otherwise in and about the work. The surety denied liability. The case was tried and a verdict rendered for the use-plaintiff in the sum of $1,-891.20, with interest, or the total sum of $2,790.31. Binding instructions for defendant were refused. A rule for judgment n. o. v. was entered and later discharged, the court saying: “In the case at bar it will be noted by reference to the above recited quotations from the contract [i. e., the agreement of the suh-contractor to give the contractor a surety bond ‘conditioned for the faithful performance of this contract in every particular and the payment for all material and labor’] and the bond [heretofore cited in this opinion] that it was the intention that the surety was to be liable to the extent of the penal sum in the bond for the execution or carrying out by the sub-contractor, H. B. Mish Company, of its said <em>contract. </em>That contract obligated it to pay for all the labor and material used by it without regard to the nature thereof and without regard to whether the material became a part of the completed structure. [The phrase of twenty-three words following the word “material” is <em>not </em>found in the contract.] What the use-plaintiff, Ainsley, furnished was just as essential to the <em>performance of the contract </em>by H. B. Mish Company, as was material remaining upon the completion of the contract a component part of the completed bridge.”</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[264,1923,1152,476]]]'>The test is not whether the materials furnished were “essential to the performance of the contract.” Such a test would be impracticable. Applying it, even the electric light furnished the laborers to enable them to work after dark, or the food and water supplied them during their employment would be included under the term “materials furnished.” The appellate courts of Pennsylvania have clearly expressed and consistently adhered to a practicable test to be applied in suits of this character.</p>

We cannot accept the reasoning of the court below that because the surety was liable to the extent of the penal sum in the bond for the execution by the subcontractor of its contract with the bridge company, and that that contract obligated it (i. e., H. B. Mish Co.) to pay for all the labor and materials used by it, and that because what Ainsley furnished was “just as essential” to the performance of the contract by the Mish Company as was the material which became a component part of the completed bridge, the surety company is liable for the coal furnished by the use-plaintiff. There was never any question of the liability of <em>the Mish Company </em>to pay for the coal furnished it. The question here is the liability of <em>the surety company </em>to pay for that coal. No such liability can be read into the bond unless the phrase “materials furnished in or about the construction of said contract” is given a meaning not heretofore judicially accepted.

Blackstone defines a contract to be an agreement upon a sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing. It is obvious, therefore, that tbe phrase “construction of said contract,” as used in tbe bond, does not refer to <em>this hind </em>of a contract. But tbe word “construction” bas also <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>another meaning of equal sanction and that is, “to build, to form, or to make.” “Contract” also has a <em>popular </em>meaning not sanctioned by lexicographers but recognized in the practical administration of the law. We said in Hempfield Twp. School Dist. v. Cavalier et al., <a href="/pa/309/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="309 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1141639" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0460-01">309 Pa. 460</a>, 469, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20602" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="164 A. 602">164 A. 602</a>: “In popular speech the word ‘contract’ is frequently used as meaning the work done under a contract. It is not uncommon to hear someone say, ‘I have a big contract,’ or for someone to say of another, ‘He has a big contract.’ By ‘contract’ as used in these expressions is meant a piece of work to be done pursuant to some contract. ‘Courts give effect to all written instruments according to the ordinary popular meaning of the terms employed, when nothing appears to show that they were used in a different sense, and no unreasonable or absurd consequences will result from doing so’: 6E. C. L., page 843, section 232.” The phrase “construction of said contract,” as used in the bond, plainly means the building and completion of the structure provided for in the contract. As used in this bond, “contract” is synonymous with “improvement” or “work,” i. e., the bridge with its approaches. In another part of the bond the phrase “construction of such improvement” is used instead of “construction of said contract,” thereby indicating that in this bond the two words under discussion mean one and the same thing. The use of the term “contract” instead of “improvement” in one part of the bond has no significance whatever in enlarging the rights of the use-plaintiff in this suit.</p>
