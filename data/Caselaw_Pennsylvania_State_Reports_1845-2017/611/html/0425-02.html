We agree. As we reasoned in <em>Senseman’s Appeal, </em>this right to be heard stems from the duty of a parent to maintain and protect his or her child’s interests. The fact that a parent has no right to his or her child’s estate does not diminish the parental duty to maintain and protect the entirety of the minor child’s interests, personal and financial.</p>

Mother’s interest is substantial because it surpasses the generalized interest of all citizens in the appointment of appropriate guardians to represent the interests of minors. Mother’s interest is direct because there is a causal connection between the appointment of the allegedly inappropriate guardian and the harm Mother alleges will inure to her child’s estate. Mother’s interest is immediate because that causal connection is not remote or speculative, but rather is asserted in the terms of the Trust. Indeed, to deny Mother standing in proceedings regarding the appointment of a guardian for her minor child, be it a guardian of the minor’s person or estate, would be to erect obstacles to the fulfillment of her parental duty to protect her child’s interests.</p>

    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[273,485,1153,945]]]'>The main difficulty in the case seems to stem from the broad wording of the Superior Court’s holding, which, by its terms, apparently implicated an issue not previously at issue in this litigation. By way of background, in her exceptions to the orphans’ court’s order of February 4, 2008, Appellant had argued that that tribunal erred in creating an irrevocable trust and directing that Father’s life insurance proceeds be deposited into the resultant trust. <em>See </em>Exceptions to February 4, 2008 Order of Court ¶ 14, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. at 27-30. Appellant had therefore contended that the orphans’ court should partially reverse itself and require that all assets to which daughter was entitled as a result of Father’s death be placed into an interest bearing account and marked “Not to Be Withdrawn until the Minor Reaches Eighteen (18) years of age or Further Order of Court.” <em>Id. </em>¶ 16. Appellant did not, however, challenge that court’s decision to appoint a limited guardian for her daughter’s estate; indeed, Appellant expressly approved of that ruling. <em>See id. </em>¶ 14.</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[274,1451,1159,679]]]'>Appellee countered by maintaining that, since Appellant did not file her appeal on behalf of or as natural parent of her daughter, Appellant was without standing to pursue <em>“the relief sought by her exceptions.” </em>Answer &amp; New Matter to Exceptions ¶ 16 (emphasis added), <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. at 31-33. The orphans’ court agreed and dismissed the exceptions, and Appellant appealed to the Superior Court. In its Rule 1925 opinion, the orphans’ court concluded that Appellant lacked standing to pursue <em>“the relief sought </em>by way of her appeal,” as she was not a named party in the original petition and did not bring the appeal on behalf of or as the natural parent of her daughter. <em>In re Miller, </em>No. 04-07-1299, <em>slip op. </em>at 2 (C.P.

In so holding, the Superior Court’s opinion evidently was read as suggesting that, not only was Appellant without standing to pursue the relief sought by her excep<em>tions </em>— i.e., the partial reversal of the orphan’s court’s order regarding the creation of the irrevocable trust for the assets of her daughter’s estate, which was the only matter in dispute on appeal — but that she also lacked standing to contest <em>any </em>aspect of that ruling, including the court’s decision to appoint a limited guardian for her daughter’s estate. <em>Cf.
