Such an interpretation requires a very broad reading of the phrase “building code standards or building codes” found in the preemption clause. The Construction Code does not define “building code standards” or “building codes”; therefore, we look to the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the Construction Code and the ordinary meaning of the relevant phrases.</p>

With that purpose in mind, we understand “building code standards or building codes” to refer to the materials, manner, and methods of construction— the nuts and bolts so to speak — which ensure a structure’s safety. For example, the Construction Code specifies the depth of a stair tread, 34 Pa.Code § 403.21(6)(ii), and whether smoke alarms should be interconnected. <em><a href="/pa/590/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="911 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="3851970,8405920" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0035-01,/a2d/911/1258-01">Id.,</a> </em>§ 403.21(6)(i).</p>

What it does not cover, however, are the more aesthetic features of a building. The Construction Code does not say whether you can have blue shutters on a green exterior or whether you are permitted to install a satellite dish on your roof. Therefore, while a homeowners’ association is preempted from establishing codes related to stair treads, it is not preempted from enforcing more subjective requirements, such as a proposed structure’s harmony with other structures. To hold that the Legislature intended to preempt <em>all </em>homeowners’ associations’ rules and regulations would lead to the absurd result of disbanding all homeowners’ associations in the Commonwealth — a result we must presume the Legislature did not intend. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>§ 1922(1) (General Assembly does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable).</p>

The Glatfelters cannot use the recreational cabin exemption as a trump card to bypass the rules and regulations to which they agreed.

Thus, I agree that the Association may, in its discretion, reject any building plans submitted to it by the Glatfelters or any other prospective homebuilder on the basis that the plans do not comply with the aesthetic requirements of the Association’s Covenants.</p>
    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.4",633,[193,726,1153,852]]]'>To the extent, however, that the OAJC infers that the Association rejected the Glatfelter’s proposed structure solely on the basis of aesthetics, <em>see id. </em>at 570, 28 A.3d at 1266 (“The Construction Code does not preempt the Association’s ability to refuse a structure for other reasons, including the harmony with other structures and, to some degree, the quality of workmanship.”), I note that no evidence of record exists to support any suggestion in this regard. Rather, if anything, the record indicates that the Association ultimately rejected any construction by the Glatfelters merely because “no proper paperwork has been submitted to the [Association].” <em>See </em>Petition for Contempt filed by the Association at ¶ 12 (Jun. 5, 2007) (found at Reproduced Record (R.R.) 92a).

In accord therewith, the Association then filed an action in equity against the Glatfelters in the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas, contending that the proposed home violated both the Covenants and the UCC incorporated therein.

Initially, I agree with the Commonwealth Court that the trial <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>court erred in focusing on the April 2004 Settlement, rather than the July 2005 Settlement. “Settlement agreements are governed by contract law principles.” <em>Lesko v.

Viewing these two settlements in light of the history of this case, one may only conclude that the parties reached an agreement in April of 2004, the Glatfelters breached that agreement, the Association filed suit, and a new settlement was reached in July of 2005, which took the place of the April 2004 Settlement. Indeed, the July 2005 Settlement specifically stated that the Glatfelters were to abide by the Association’s “rules and regulations now in effect.” July 2005 Settlement at ¶ 2.

Put succinctly, the Association contends that the Glatfelters are equitably estopped from invoking the recreational cabin exemption because they agreed not to do so in the July 2005 Settlement. In response, the Glatfelters argue that because the UCC supersedes all conflicting regulations by homeowners’ associations, <em>see </em>35 P.S. § 7210.104(d)(2)(i), the Association could not except itself out of the recreational cabin exemption.

In other words, if all that is proposed is a two-story secondary residence (thus satisfying clauses (2) through (7) of Section 7210.103), then all a person need do is certify that the home will be “utilized primarily for recreational activity” to qualify for the exemption.</p>

House Bill 2149 of 2003 was then introduced to attempt to alleviate some of the strictness of the UCC, including abolishing many of the requirements it imposed upon persons making small repairs to homes. Importantly to the discussion at hand, the bill also included what has now become known as the recreational cabin exemption. However, in HB 2149, a recreational cabin was defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>“a structure used principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> HB 2149, however, while passed by the House, was never acted upon in the Senate.</p>

In the Bill Summary for SB 1139, prepared on July 2, 2004 (the day after the House of Representatives passed an amended version of SB 1139, but prior to the Senate’s final passage of the bill), recreational cabins were defined consistent with the HB 2149 definition: “used principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing.” Further, the Bill Summary stated that the exemption was necessary because enforcement of the UCC in the backwoods of rural counties is almost impossible, and the “sportsmen who utilize hunting/fishing cabins are not concerned about the standardization/quality of construction and, in fact, are responsible citizens that accept rustic conditions.” House of Representatives Bill Summary, SB 1139, at 3 (Jul. 2, 2004) (Bill Summary). The legislature passed SB 1139 on July 4, 2004, and it became Act 92 of 2004. With this background, it should follow that the General Assembly intended the term “recreational activity” in Act 92 to encompass seasonal hunting, fishing, and like activities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a>
