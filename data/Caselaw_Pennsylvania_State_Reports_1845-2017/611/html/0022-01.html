Appellant admitted the agents to the residence and consented to a search of the residence and her purse. The agents located various amounts of marijuana in separate baggies, drug paraphernalia, a bank deposit bag containing $400 cash, and a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson .357 Magnum handgun under the mattress in the bedroom. Appellant waived her right to a preliminary hearing and was arraigned on February 7, 2007 on charges of possession of a controlled substance (marijuana), possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) with intent to deliver (“PWID”), criminal conspiracy to possess a controlled substance (marijuana) with the intent to deliver and/or delivery thereof, and possession of drug paraphernalia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> When Prisk was tried in July 2007, appellant testified for the defense and admitted that the drugs were hers for personal use.

The following day, the trial court accepted the plea agreement and noted the Commonwealth’s intention to seek the five-year mandatory minimum sentence provided in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1, which enables enhancement of sentences for certain drug offenses committed in association with firearms, as follows:</p>

An oral plea colloquy was conducted on December 27, 2007, and arguments were heard from both sides regarding sentencing. The court applied the mandatory minimum and sentenced appellant to five years of imprisonment on the PWID charge, to be followed by three years of probation. The court stated expressly at both the proceeding and in its order that it had imposed the five-year sentence “in view of the fact that this offense involved a firearm, which carries the minimum of five years.” N.T., 12/27/07, at 13; Trial Ct. Sentencing Order, 12/31/07. In post-sentence motions, appellant argued that the mandatory minimum sentence should not have been imposed upon her since, at the time of her arrest, the handgun was <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>“inoperable” due to the absence of a firing pin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth responded that Section 9712.1 expressly adopts the definition of “firearm” in Section 9712, which governs mandatory sentences for crimes of violence committed in association with firearms. That definition reads: “ ‘Firearm.’ Any weapon, including a starter gun, which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or the expansion of gas therein.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712(e). According to the prosecutor, neither Section 9712 nor Section 9712.1 requires that a firearm be “functional” for the mandatory minimum sentence to be applicable. Appellant argued that Section 9712.1, unlike Section 9712(a), does not include language expressly discounting operability, so under Section 9712.1, the inoperability of the handgun here should have rendered the enhancement inapplicable. After argument, the court granted appellant’s motion, vacated the initial sentence, and sentenced appellant instead to nine months of imprisonment in the Clearfield County jail, to be followed by a total of nine years of probation.</p>

The court stated that the “main purpose” of Section 9712, with its focus on violent crimes committed with firearms, is the visual impact upon the crime victim and the “level of fear the victim experiences during the commission of a violent crime involving a firearm.” Under Section 9712, the court explained, whether the firearm itself is actually functional or even real (as opposed to a replica) is of no ultimate consequence.</p>

The court also noted that Section 9712 may not apply in circumstances where a violent crime is committed but the imminent threat of violence is lessened or non-existent, such as where the weapon is concealed and not brandished; the court then reasoned that Section 9712.1, by analogy, should not apply if the underlying offense does not entail imminent violence or the threat thereof. Trial Ct. Op., 7/17/08, at 3-4 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court added: “The legislature clearly expresses an intent to apply § 9712 where a firearm is not functional because the inoperable firearm is still capable of putting a victim of a violent crime in fear of harm or death but the legislature did not extend such a provision to § 9712.1, where the language is absent.” Trial Ct.

The panel majority opinion by Judge Bowes stated that, as the prosecutor had argued to the trial court, Section 9712.1 expressly adopts the definition of a “firearm” set forth in Section 9712, which embraces any weapon “which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or the expansion of gas <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>therein” (emphasis in opinion). Moreover, the panel majority-rejected the trial court’s reliance on <em>Layton. </em>The panel majority noted that <em>Layton </em>involved an entirely different statute, the Uniform Firearms Act (“UFA”), and a previous UFA definition of “firearm” at 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105 that has since been amended to include circumstances where (like here) a firearm is inoperable. <em>Layton </em>was thus inapplicable because Section 9712.1’s companion statute, Section 9712, sets forth a definition of “firearm” that expressly applies to both statutory provisions. <em>See </em><a href="/a2d/985/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="985 A.2d 238" data-case-ids="7291515" data-case-paths="/a2d/985/0238-01">985 A.2d at 241-42</a>.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that the language of both sections is clear and unambiguous, and does not require operability, but instead requires only that the weapon “is designed to expel a projectile,” as appellant’s firearm certainly was. To the Commonwealth: “the loaded weapon at issue here, regardless of the missing firing pin, was one that was designed to expel a projectile.” The Commonwealth adds that the presence in Section 9712 of the disjunctive “or” in the definition of “firearm” — “will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile” — broadens the swath of applicable “firearms” and supports application of the mandatory sentence here. Finally, the Commonwealth forwards a construction argument premised upon the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(matters not included in a statutory provision are deemed to be excluded). The Commonwealth notes that Section 9712.1 has no operability requirement and that the General Assembly could easily have included the requirement if it so intended. The Commonwealth adds that “[bjeside this omission, the definition’s orientation to design and convertibility appear to recognize, albeit tacitly, that a qualifying object might not be instantly functional.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 5-6.</p>

Turning to the <em>Bond </em>and <em>Fitzhugh </em>cases, the Commonwealth notes that the Superi- or Court improperly and unnecessarily “interjected a requirement of operability into the definition of ‘firearm’ under 9712” that was not supported by the statutory text. The Commonwealth also points to Section 9712(a), which the General Assembly amended in 1995 to make clearer that the enhancement is applicable “whether or not the firearm or replica was loaded or functional.” In the Commonwealth’s view, the General Assembly intended this amendment to “correct” the Superior Court’s holdings in <em>Bond </em>and <em>Fitzhugh. </em>Commonwealth’s Brief at 7-8. By the same token, the Commonwealth argues that the “absence of similar language” regarding operability in Section 9712.1 (as opposed to Section 9712(a)) is conclusive of legislative intent. The Commonwealth explains that Section 9712.1 was enacted in 2004 as a companion to Section 9712, expressly imports Section 9712’s definition of “firearm,” and neither subsection (e) nor subsection (a) of Section 9712 requires the Commonwealth to establish operability. The Commonwealth concludes that the Superior Court in this case correctly interpreted the pertinent statutory provisions and correctly declined to import an inapplicable caselaw-based “operability requirement” from the <em>Layton/Bond/Fitzhugh </em>cases into the clear mandatory sentencing enhancement scheme detailed at sections 9712 and 9712.1.

Section 9712.1, which was enacted in 2004 (effective January 31, 2005) to address drug trafficking offenses, reads in pertinent part as follows: “As used in this section, the term ‘firearm’ shall have the same meaning as that given to it in section 9712 (relating to sentences for offenses committed with firearms).” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1.</p>

Section 9712.1 expressly states that the term firearm “shall have the same meaning as that given to it in section 9712.” The definition of “firearm” in Section 9712 is clear and unambiguous: “Any weapon, including a starter gun, which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or the expansion of gas therein.” This definition requires only that the weapon be capable of firing a bullet (“will”), easily rendered capable of firing a bullet (“may readily be converted”) or, pertinent to this case, “designed to” fire a bullet. The <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>parties here focus on the third sub-definition, regarding design.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Webster’s Dictionary defines “design” in a number of ways, including as both a verb and a noun, but these variants on the definition all share the quality that the design itself, or the thing designed, is something planned, intended, purposeful, deliberate, or even “schemed” towards some specific end or outcome. The General Assembly was more than capable of drafting Section 9712.1 to differentiate between the use or presence of firearms in the context of drug offenses as opposed to violent offenses, or to include an operability requirement in Section 9712.1 that would render it different from Section 9712, which- expressly negates such a requirement. That the General Assembly made no such distinctions when it drafted Section 9712.1 suggests that it intended a unitary definition. Nothing in the Commonwealth’s plain reading of Section 9712.1 is either absurd or unreasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Arguably, firing a bullet is the only true “designed” <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>function — in fact, the essence — of a handgun, pistol, or “firearm.” This is so whether the handgun is functional, defectively manufactured, or temporarily inoperable for some other reason. A car without gas does not lose its identity as an entity designed for locomotion. A laptop computer does not cease to be a computer if its battery is removed. By the same reasoning, nor does a handgun lose its designed function merely because a critical piece is missing. The Superior Court correctly concluded: “Thus, it is irrelevant that the weapon in question did not have a firing pin and was no longer capable of actually firing a bullet; the record establishes that it was a gun that had been designed to shoot bullets. It thereby fell -within the definition of firearm under § 9712(e) and thus, § 9712.1.” 985 A.2d at 243. Appellant’s interpretation of “firearm” as requiring some show of operability would negate Section 9712’s definition of a “firearm” as, <em>inter alia, </em>a weapon “designed to” fire bullets.</p>
    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[144,1236,1151,897]]]'>Nor is this plain language construction of Sections 9712 and 9712.1 contrary to judicial precedent. The <em>Layton, Fitzhugh, </em>and <em>Bond </em>cases do not require a construction of Sections 9712 and 9712.1 that would be contrary to those provisions’ plain meaning. <em>Layton, </em>a 1973 decision of this Court, addressed a since-superseded definition of “firearm” in a different statute — the UFA. The UFA definition of “firearm” addressed in <em>Layton </em>has since been superseded with language essentially identical to that in Section 9712; in both statutory schemes, operability does not have the same relevance that it had under the previous version of the statute. Second, the UFA provision at issue in <em>Layton </em>was aimed at deterring violent criminals from possession of firearms. This analytical framework may once have served as a viable analogy to Section 9712, which is directed at violent crimes committed with a firearm, but it has little theoretical correlation to Section 9712.1, which is directed at the specific realm of drug trafficking offenses.</p>

Nor did these cases constrain the General Assembly from negating operability in Section 9712 and expressly adopting Section 9712’s definition of a firearm when it enacted Section 9712.1 in response to the increasing prevalence of guns in the realm of drug trafficking, as the legislative passages excerpted at footnote 4, <em>supra, </em>reveal. These cases do not support appellant’s attempt to have this Court import or engraft an operability requirement into the otherwise plain and clear language of Section 9712’s definition of “firearm,” as adopted without qualification in Section 9712.1.</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[279,1257,1151,577]]]'>Ultimately, the trial court’s analysis here, echoed by appellant, focuses on questions of policy and distinctions between violent crime and drug trafficking. But, as has often been stated, it is the General Assembly’s “prerogative as the policy-setting branch” to make (or decline to make) such distinctions. <em>See, e.g., In re D.L.H., </em><a href="/pa/606/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="606 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="4199489" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0550-01">606 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/pa/606/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="2 A.3d 505" data-case-ids="4199489,7288144" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0550-01,/a3d/2/0505-01">2 A.3d 505</a>, 515 (2010). The fact that no legislative distinction was made here is not a legitimate ground to ignore the plain language of the statute: the .357 Magnum handgun found in appellant’s residence in close proximity to the narcotics, with or without its firing pin, was by definition a “firearm.”</p>

Notably, the available legislative history indicates that the General Assembly’s main concern in enacting Section 9712.1 was not to ponder the definition of a "firearm,” but to provide law enforcement and prosecution personnel across the Commonwealth with greater means to "break the link between guns and drugs once and for all.... The whole purpose of this legislation to provide a mandatory sentence is to take guns out of drug trafficking and stop gun violence.” <em>Consideration of H.B. 752 Continued, </em>Pa. H.R. Reg. Sess. No. 105 (Dec. 16, 2003) (statement of Rep. Bard of Montgomery County); "The purpose of this amendment is to provide a deterrent for those who are dealing in drugs and using firearms.” <em>Reconsideration of A5329, </em>Pa. S. Reg. Sess. No. 65 (Nov. 19, 2004) (statement of Sen. Piccola of Dauphin County). It is true that brandishing a gun during a crime of violence with regard to Section 9712 is not the same as the "close proximity” requirement in Section 9712.1, which applies to drug crimes. But the determination of the General Assembly to treat these different scenarios in the same manner for purposes of mandatory sentencing was a distinct policy matter for that legislative body.</p>
