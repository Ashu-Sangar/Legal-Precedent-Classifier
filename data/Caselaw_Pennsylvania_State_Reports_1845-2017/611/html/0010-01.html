A notice of compensation payable was issued, and Mr. Ressler began receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits and coverage for his medical bills.

The employer concurrently requested supersedeas pursuant to § 413 of the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. §§ 1-1041.4. A Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) denied the supersedeas request August 30, 2004. On October 11, 2004, a $35,405.45 bill for the June 1 surgery was submitted to the insurer, which paid the bill January 25, 2005.

As the insurer did not request supersedeas until six weeks after the surgery, the insurer could not have made the payment as a result of denial of supersedeas as required by § 443(a). Payment, the Bureau argues, was an obligation cemented by the failure to seek supersedeas before the service was provided. To find as did the Commonwealth Court, it contends, may encourage insurers to withhold payment of medical bills until after supersedeas requests are resolved, improperly shifting medical costs to the Supersedeas Fund and its contributing employers.</p>

First, is this a case “in which a supersedeas has been requested and denied”? It is — supersedeas was requested in July, 2004, and denied August 20, 2004. Second, was the request under the provisions of § 413 or § 430? The record shows it was under § 413.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Third, were payments <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>made “as a result” of the August 20 denial? This is the contested element. The bill for the June surgery did not arrive until six weeks after the denial of supersedeas, and as denial meant the insurer was not relieved of the obligation to pay the bill, payment was indeed the result of the denial. Someone owed payment on the surgical bill, but the insurer denied liability for it — payment by the insurer of the bill (pending resolution of liability) was mandated by denial of supersedeas, not from an obligation necessitated by the surgery itself. Lastly, was there a final determination that compensation was not in fact payable? Yes, the WCJ ultimately granted the petition to terminate benefits as of the March 16, 2004 IME date. Accordingly, “the insurer who has made such payments shall be reimbursed therefor.” 77 P.S. § 999(a).</p>

That ultimate obligation to pay was undetermined when the bill was due, but the duty to pay it in the meantime fell to the insurer as supersedeas had been denied. Ultimately, it was not an obligation of the insurer; the insurer’s payment cannot be the result of the surgery, for in the end, it had no responsibility for that bill at all. What the insurer did have the obligation to do was cover the bill pending the final determination, and that obligation was the direct and singular result of the denial of supersedeas.</p>

One can fathom a host of situations where justice might require a supersedeas relative to payment for past medical services, such as where the treatment is unrelated to a work injury, the employer had no notice or opportunity to challenge the treatment prior to its execution, or where the insurer has no precertification or prior approval of the treatment. To tie the WCJ’s hands in light of the plain language of the statute and the clear authority provided by the legislature would go against our duty to effectuate the legislature’s intentions, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a), and we decline to do so.</p>

The insurer continued meeting its responsibility until the WCJ found Mr. Ressler was not suffering from a work-related injury at the time of the surgery. Had supersedeas been granted, payment would not have been made, but supersedeas was not granted and payment necessarily followed. It is the bill, post-denial, that caused money to leave the coffers of the insurer. Ergo, payment resulted from the denial. As the date the bill arose is irrelevant under the plain language of the statute, we find the Commonwealth Court appropriately ordered reimbursement to the insurer for undue payments made after request of supersedeas and in direct response to its denial.</p>

My reading of the above authority leads me to conclude that the employer would have been responsible for paying the surgery bill even had its supersede-as request been granted, because the claimant’s treatment occurred prior to that request. A grant of supersedeas would only have suspended the employer’s obligation to pay benefits accruing after supersedeas had been requested. <em>See </em>Section 413(a.2) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 774(2) (providing that “supersedeas shall serve to suspend the payment of compensation in whole or to such extent as the facts alleged in the petition would, if proved, require.”) (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

      <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>Related to the above, the majority does not explain the anomalous result that springs from its holding, to wit, that the right to recoup payment for the same medical treatment is now dependent upon whether the bill for this treatment is presented to and paid by the employer prior to or after the supersedeas request. Stated another way, the majority’s holding essentially hinges on the arbitrary fact present in this case that the medical provider had taken its time to submit the bill for payment.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[284,828,1150,473]]]'>I do not discount the important salutary purpose of Section 443(a) to provide a mechanism for an employer to be reimbursed for benefit payments made that are ultimately determined to be unrelated to the work injury. However, Section 443(a) provides only for a specific and limited mechanism under which there may be reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund, not for a total recapture of benefits paid. In this regard, Section 443(a) evidences another important legislative goal that we must consider, as well.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[281,1340,1151,900]]]'>Distilled to its elements, Section 443(a) requires that: (1) a supersedeas must be requested and denied in a proceeding falling under either Section 413 or 430; (2) “payments of compensation are made as a result thereof’; and (3) by the conclusion of the proceeding, there is a determination that “such compensation was not, in fact, payable.” It is significant that the General Assembly made Fund reimbursement dependent on all of these elements. The General Assembly could have — but chose not to — simply provide for automatic and full reimbursement where it is determined that the employer made payments of compensation that are ultimately determined to be unrelated to the work injury. Had the General Assembly done so, it certainly would have fulfilled the goal of relieving the employer from paying any benefits unrelated to the work injury, a consideration that the majority here apparently considered very important in its analysis. <em>See </em>Majority <em>op. </em>at 16-17, 23 A.3d at 515.</p>
    <p id="b81-3" data-blocks='[["BL_81.3",81,[161,313,1153,1375]]]'>
      <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>However, the General Assembly did not provide for such all-encompassing relief. Rather, the General Assembly hinged the employer’s recoupment of benefits paid upon the employer’s prompt action. Section 413 of the Act provides for an automatic supersedeas process in the event an employer files a petition to terminate, suspend, or modify where the petition is accompanied by a physician’s affidavit asserting the employee’s full recovery, based upon a medical examination made within twenty-one days of the filing of the employer’s petition. Section 413(a.l) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 774(a.l). However, “in any other case,” where there has been no compliance with Section 413(a.l), including the instant one, a filing of a petition to terminate, suspend, or modify does “not automatically operate as a supersedeas.” Section 413(a.2) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 774(a.2). Rather, such petition serves only as a request for supersedeas, which may or may not be granted, in the WCJ’s discretion, following a hearing. <em>Id. </em>This section specifically provides that “[a] supersedeas shall serve to suspend the payment of compensation in whole or to such extent as the facts alleged in the petition would, if proved, require.” <em>Id. </em>Thus, I read from these provisions (1) an important legislative goal to encourage employers to act promptly, where prompt action rewards employers with greater relief; and (2) that such relief is confined to a “suspension” of the employer’s obligation to pay benefits, not a retroactive recoupment of benefits.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[163,1721,1150,635]],["BL_82.1",82,[271,315,1149,402]]]'>Applying my interpretation of Sections 413(a.2) and 443(a) to the present matter, I believe that the employer is entitled to supersedeas relief only regarding those benefits due and owing as of the date it requested supersedeas, and thereafter. Thus, the employer is not entitled to relief for any benefits due and owing prior to its supersedeas request. As the surgical procedure here occurred prior to the employer’s supersedeas request, the employer could not seek suspension of its obligation to pay under Sections 413(a.2) and 443(a) any more than it could seek suspension of disability benefits due and owing prior to the date supersedeas was requested. The fact that the bill for that procedure was submitted after the <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>date supersedeas was requested is, in my view, a happenstance unrelated to the focus of Sections 413(a.2) and 443(a). Had the billing department of the hospital submitted its bill immediately, and the employer paid the bill as required under the Act, which would have been before the date the employer requested supersedeas, there would be no question that the employer could not seek Supersedeas Fund reimbursement for this expense under Section 443(a).</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[269,741,1150,819]]]'>Finally, I note that the Act reflects a series of legislative solutions and compromises creating a carefully considered overall scheme that may be unintentionally thrown off by judicial interpretations that focus on perceived equities, particularly those not inuring to the claimant. There is a strong current in the majority’s analysis that it would simply be inequitable for the employer to pay for a surgical procedure that was ultimately determined to be unrelated to the underlying work injury. However, absent from the majority’s analysis is a focus on the efficiencies built into the legislative scheme, which require the employer to take timely action in order to fully reap the benefits the Act relevantly provides. Because of that circumstance, and my interpretation of what the General Assembly intended by confining supersedeas relief under Section 413(a.2) to a “suspension” of an employer’s obligation to pay benefits, I respectfully dissent.</p>
