In the present case, the floor was Dr. Detweiler’s $200,000 “basic coverage insurance” (as it was denominated by the HCSMA, 40 P.S. § 1301.701(d) (superseded)). Therefore, such liability as Dr. Detweiler bore for the shortfall in Dr. Carver’s primary coverage, as well as associated delay damages and pre-judgment interest, fell within the CAT Fund’s excess coverage obligation relative to Dr. Detweiler. <em>See supra </em>note 7. The responsibility for this now falls to the MCARE Fund, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 1303.712(b), with the benefits inuring to Dr. Detweiler, and, derivatively, to Mr. Heim.</p>
