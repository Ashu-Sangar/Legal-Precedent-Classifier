These convictions and sentence arose from the following circumstances. Appellee was arrested and charged with the above offenses after the victim, L.Y., saw Appellee walking down the street and recognized him as one of two men who had sexually assaulted and robbed her several months before. At Appellee’s trial, L.Y. testified that, while she had been walking home one evening in December 1985, Appellee and another man had forced her into a car at gunpoint and had raped her repeatedly in the car. L.Y. testified further that she had had the opportunity to look closely at her assailants as the assault went on for more than an hour in a well-lit area, and she was unwavering in her identification of Appellee as one of the men who had raped and robbed her. Police artists had made a composite sketch of Appellee and the other assailant based on L.Y.’s descriptions of them; the sketch of Appellee was shown to the jury. In addition, L.Y. testified that after Appellee’s arrest and while he was awaiting trial, the other assailant had stopped her at gunpoint on the street, and had threatened her and her children with harm if she were to testify against “Vincent.” In defense, Appellee <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>claimed mistaken identity and proffered an alibi, which the jury rejected, finding him guilty of all counts.</p>

The petition was granted, the testing was conducted, and it revealed the presence of DNA from three different men, none of whom could have been Appellee. Based on these findings, in 1995, the PCRA court vacated Appellee’s convictions and granted him a new trial. In 1996, the Commonwealth withdrew the charges against Appellee, and an order of <em>nolle prosse </em>was entered. The Commonwealth explained that it could not meet its burden of proof at a second trial because it was unable to locate the victim, who had moved from the area after Appellee’s 1987 trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

At an expungement hearing on March 5, 2008, the prosecutor summarized the evidence presented against Appellee at his 1987 trial, evidence to which Appellee stipulated as having been presented. The prosecutor then called the assistant district attorney who had prosecuted the 1987 case against Appellee, to the witness stand. He testified that L.Y.’s account of the assault was detailed and consistent and her identification of Appellee was convincing, but that the threats against her and her children had frightened her and caused her to move from the neighborhood. This witness opined that the DNA evidence did not exculpate Appellee because he may not have ejaculated during the rape. Next, the Commonwealth called the assistant district attorney who was the assistant chief of the Family Violence and Sexual Assault Unit in 1996 when Appellee’s case was <em>nolle prossed. </em>He testified that the case was <em>nolle prossed </em>because of an inability to locate the victim, but stated that if she had been located, the Commonwealth would have retried Appellee. He also opined that the DNA results did not exonerate Appellee, and offered potential explanations for why the DNA on the victim’s underwear did not match Appellee’s DNA, <em>i.e., </em>Appellee may not have ejaculated during the rape, and the DNA patterns might reflect prior sexual activity with other partners, particularly since biological stains can remain on clothing for many years, even after laundering. Appellee called only a single witness, a private investigator, who testified that, with a brief search of public databases, he had found several addresses where L.Y. was reported to have lived from 1995-1997, which was close to the time when the Commonwealth claimed it could not locate her.</p>

Appellee contends that the trial court incorrectly interpreted and applied the second <em>Wexier </em>factor, <em>i.e., </em>the Commonwealth's reasons for wishing to retain the criminal records, and that the Superior Court properly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in this regard. Appellee's Brief at 27-30 (citing <em>V.A.M., </em><a href="/a2d/980/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="980 A.2d 131" data-case-ids="7292726" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/0131-01">980 A.2d at 137</a>). In <em>Wexier, </em>we explained that the Commonwealth's “mere assertion of a general interest in maintaining accurate records of those accused of crime” would not suffice to convince the court of the necessity to retain the arrest records of any particular individual. <em>Wexier, </em><a href="/pa/494/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="431 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="1769128" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0325-01">431 A.2d at 880-81</a> (emphasis added). Rather, the special facts and particular circumstances of each individual case must be cited and analyzed to establish why the Commonwealth wishes to retain that specific individual's records. There is no dispute between the parties here that the Commonwealth’s assertion of a general interest in maintaining accurate criminal records is not sufficient to justify retention of the records. We acknowledge that, as Appellee asserts, some of the trial court language, if viewed in isolation, may suggest that the trial court was indeed giving weight to the Commonwealth's "general interest” in maintaining accurate criminal records. For example, the trial court wrote that "the Commonwealth has a great interest in retaining the arrest record stemming from crimes as serious as rape.” Trial Court Opinion at 5. However, we do not interpret this sentence in isolation, but rather view it in the context of the rest of the paragraph in which it was found, which clarifies that the trial court did analyze the specific facts and circumstances of Appellee's case.</p>

Madgon, </em><a href="/pa-super/310/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 84" data-case-ids="209769" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0084-01">310 Pa.Super. 84</a>, <a href="/pa-super/310/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 84" data-case-ids="209769" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0084-01">456 A.2d 194</a> (1983), we have never addressed that issue. Therefore, it remains an open question whether, pursuant to Section 9122(a)(2), a trial court could order expungement of criminal history record information for a person convicted of a crime.</p>
