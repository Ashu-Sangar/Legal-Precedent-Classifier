Officer Miller radioed for assistance, then pursued and stopped the sports car.

The Report and Recommendation specifically indicates that the understanding between the parties, including the prosecutor and the Indiana County Court of Common Pleas trial judge, was that “until sentence was imposed the conviction was not final and could <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>not be introduced as an aggravating factor in the Westmoreland County proceedings.” Report and Recommendation, 10/7/96, at 15 n. 7 (emphasis added).

He further claims the statute “allows complete and unbridled discretion on the part of the prosecutor in determining whether or not to apply the death penalty,” and “allows for different standards to be established by each of the prosecutors in the 67 different <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without the existence of any guidelines.” <em>Id. </em>at 74-75.

Such an approach would lead, however, to a highly irrational sentencing scheme. Those whose sentences are vacated by this court would be in a far worse position than those whose sentences are vacated by other courts, since the former would be at risk of incurring another death sentence while the latter would not.

Moreover, Appellant was permitted to introduce a forensic psychiatrist’s opinion that he manifested a low potential for future aggression. <em>See </em>N.T., at 875. Notably, based on Appellant’s extensive mitigation case (including testimony from Appellant’s wife, his mother, school officials and teachers, numerous friends, neighbors, several clergypersons, a former attorney for Appellant, prison supervisors and guards, a corrections counselors, and a forensic psychiatrist), one or more jurors found that he had lived as a well-adjusted inmate since 1982, and that he had changed his life and adopted a Christian lifestyle. <em>See </em>N.T., at 1184-85. In the circumstances, and particularly given the strength of the Commonwealth’s case of aggravation, there does not seem to me to be a substantial likelihood of a different outcome had Mr. Miller been permitted — as I believe he should have — to offer an additional opinion concerning Appellant’s amenability to being introduced into the general inmate population.</p>
