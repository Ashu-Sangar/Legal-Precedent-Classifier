Specifically, we query whether the lower courts properly applied the test in determining that a search warrant application was infirm because the affidavit of probable cause failed to expound, expressly, upon the veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge of a confidential informant (“Cl”). Because the totality of the circumstances underlying the application here included a factual recitation describing a successful controlled buy of narcotics that corroborated the affiant’s averment that the Cl was reliable, and because that recitation demonstrated a fair probability that narcotics would be found in the location for which the warrant was sought, we determine that the warrant was supported by probable cause. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>

The affidavit of probable cause stated that on September 8, 2004, a “reliable confidential informant” had informed Officer Kidd that a white male, approximately 6'-6'2" in height, weighing approximately 170-<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>195 lbs., known as “Steve,” packages and distributes cocaine from 4242 Salmon Street in Philadelphia, and makes deliveries of cocaine in a white Pontiac Grand Am with a black roof, Pennsylvania license number FRG-5450. The affidavit further stated that the police conducted a controlled drug buy on September 9, 2004, as follows: The police observed a white male matching the description of “Steve” depart 4242 Salmon Street, directly enter a white Pontiac Grand Am with a black roof and license number FRG-5450, and drive to the site of a pre-arranged controlled buy. The police observed as the Cl purchased cocaine in two green plastic baggies from the white male with $40 pre-recorded buy money. After the transaction, the police followed the white male back to 4242 Salmon Street, where they saw him exit the Pontiac and directly enter the residence. The police verified that the Pontiac was registered to “Steve Clark” with an address of 4242 Salmon Street.</p>

It acknowledged that the affidavit stated that the Cl was “reliable,” but was concerned that there was no information as to how the reliability of the Cl was established. The court opined, “[W]e are left to guess what circumstances exist which render the informant credible and his information reliable.” Trial Court Opinion, dated 10/5/06, at 4. The court also questioned the basis of the Cl’s knowledge because the affidavit did not state that the Cl had been in the residence before, or some similar facts upon which a reviewing authority could conclude that drugs would likely be found in the residence. It determined, “In the absence of information explaining how the informant knew that cocaine was being packaged and distributed inside defendant’s residence[,] there is insufficient probable cause to <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>issue the warrant for a search of defendant’s residence.” <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>

It concluded, as the trial court did, that the application was infirm because the affiant did not expressly state how he knew that the Cl was reliable, or how the Cl knew that there were drugs in the residence. Moreover, both the trial court and Superior Court held that, in order to be valid, any probable cause affidavit based on confidential information must contain, at a minimum, the “customary” recitation that the informant has provided information in the past that has resulted in arrests or convictions. Memorandum Opinion, 10/29/08, at 11.

I recognize that there are cases where error correction by this Court serves a salutary supervisory purpose, cases where even though the decision below was unpublished, the jurisprudential error or misapplication of the law is serious enough to warrant this Court’s involvement. However, I see very little point in this Court’s taking up fact-bound cases such as this, involving settled law applied in an unpublished memorandum decision below, and conducting a second round of error review. The Superior Court’s approach here was within the realm of reasonable application of the settled precedent and I would leave that court to its error-reviewing task. The tendency, when this Court conducts mere error review, is to exaggerate the perceived mistake below and to make it appear more than it is. Here, it is not even as if the panel flatly and erroneously ignored or misapplied the governing standard. More importantly, there is no suggestion of a broader pattern of the Superior Court’s repeated misapprehension or misinterpretation of settled law in this area. Four respected, competent judges below reviewed this issue and all four determined that the warrant was infirm, and that should be good enough, even though other judges might have weighed the same evidence differently. Absent some broader issue of statewide importance, the existing review is sufficient. Hence, I respectfully dissent.</p>
