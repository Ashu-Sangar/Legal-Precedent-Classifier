However, a CBA was entered into by the school district and the union that required the school district to report to PSERS the actual, higher wages received by union-leave employees, not the wages they would have received had they simply remained in their school district jobs.

Relevantly, Section 8102 of PSERC provides “that the employer shall fully compensate the member including, but not <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>limited to, salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits, other benefits and seniority, as if he were in full-time active service.” 24 Pa.C.S. § 8102.

First, there are critical differences be<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>tween <em>Kirsch II </em>and the instant case. <em>Kirsch II </em>did not involve the issue of whether public school employees on union leave should be paid in line with their school employee salaries. It was accepted in <em>Kirsch II </em>that such employees are simply paid more while on union leave, commensurate with their union duties. The only issues in <em>Kirsch II </em>were whether the employees should receive credit for these higher salaries for purposes of computing their retirement pension benefits, and whether the higher union salaries artificially enhanced or inflated their retirement benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 672. <em>Kirsch II </em>arose from an appeal from a decision of the Public School Employees’ Retirement Board interpreting its mandate under the PSERC. Significantly, it did not arise from an appeal of an interest arbitration award under Act 111 or the Public Employe Relations Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> that set the salaries of employees on union leave. <em>Kirsch II </em>dealt with post-employment retirement matters, not the salary requirements of present employees, which are at issue in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[142,1288,1153,786]]]'>Thus, <em>Kirsch II </em>did not concern itself with the unique question of the authority of an Act 111 interest arbitration panel to enter an award concerning union-leave employee salaries, an authority that patently exists under Section 1 of Act 111. Further, although <em>Kirsch II </em>did opine that proviso language in PSERC Section 8102 sets conditions on union service, <em>Kirsch II </em>did not define the full limit of what those conditions were, which was not the issue then before the Court. Therefore, we do not read <em>Kirsch II </em>as compelling the conclusion that the relevant proviso language of Section 5302(b)(2) of the SERC establishes a legislative ceiling on what state troopers on union leave may receive as salary. Again, the instant case does not involve the calculation of pensions but the essential authority of an Act 111 interest arbitration panel to set salaries.</p>

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Saylor articulates a different interpretation of Section 5302(b)(2), which, respectfully, we find unpersuasive. Justice Saylor opines that our interpretation would create "an untenable administrative burden on the Commonwealth,” a charge that is wholly unsupported by any evidence of record and not advanced by the Commonwealth itself. Indeed, we believe that the Commonwealth is fully capable of addressing what would appear to be a simple accounting matter, as it has shown itself capable of handling the myriad accounting issues imposed by the complex requirements of the federal and state tax codes. As almost anyone who receives a paycheck from the Pennsylvania Treasury has observed, the Commonwealth’s accountants are fully capable of reporting an employee's income for one purpose in a manner that is different from that used for another purpose and, at the same time, closely tracking an employee’s retirement status. More critically, a helpful desire to ease the burdens of the Commonwealth's accountants concerning at most a handful of people each year is not grounds for the-judiciary to exercise power in an area — state trooper wages- — exclusively reserved by the General Assembly for Act 111 arbitrators. We believe that more must be shown to establish that the arbitration award has violated Section 5302(b).</p>

Nevertheless, according to the lead opinion, an Act 111 arbitrator has the legal authority to disregard the statute’s manifest retirement-related design and require the Commonwealth to tender to an on-leave employee more than the statutorily authorized payments, thus decoupling the payment scheme from its foundation. <em>See id. </em>at 66-67, 73-74, 23 A.3d at 972-73, 976-77. The lead Justices posit that there is no harm, because the Commonwealth obtains reimbursement from the union, and any adverse impact on the retirement system may <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>be corrected on some later occasion and in some different forum. <em>See id. </em>at 73-74, 23 A.3d at 976-77.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[137,432,1155,644]]]'>The difficulty, however, is that, to the degree Act 111 arbitrators disturb the statutory compensation scheme, they create an untenable administrative burden on the Commonwealth and the retirement system. In this regard, in order to comply with their statutory duties, the Commonwealth employer and the retirement system must create a dual tracking system to account for both payments actually made by the Commonwealth and as-if-in-full-time-active-service components. Controversy over the appropriate administration of such a system — which certainly was not contemplated by the Legislature in prescribing as-if-in-full-time-active-service payment in the first instance — is bound to yield uncertainty and litigation.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[140,1097,1153,802]]]'>My comments on the consequences of the lead opinion’s approach are responsive to the pronouncement that there is no harm, which the lead Justices offer to bolster their decision divorcing a statutory rate-of-pay provision from its roots in the pension context. My remarks are not based on some “helpful desire to ease the burdens of the Commonwealth’s accountants,” as the lead opinion suggests. Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, <em>Op. </em>at 75 n. 13, 23 A.3d at 977 n. 13. In my view, the maintenance of an integrated scheme of compensation and retirement accrual is compelled by the enabling statute, <em>i.e., </em>the Retirement Code. I also remain of the belief that the lead Justices underestimate the degree of ongoing uncertainty, controversy, and expense attending their decision to sanction a decoupling of the rate of pay tendered by a governmental employer to employees on leave for union service from the statutory foundation.</p>

    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[285,604,1150,419]]]'>I fully appreciate that Commonwealth employees on leave for union service often undertake additional duties and responsibilities, warranting higher compensation from the bargaining unit. The Association has not explained, however, why additional compensation, commensurate with the non-governmental work performed, cannot be afforded outside the parameters of a defined scheme of compensation from the Commonwealth tailored for retirement purposes.</p>
