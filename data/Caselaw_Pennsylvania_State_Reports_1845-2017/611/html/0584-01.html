Later that morning, a teacher at the Center found a nude body lying sideways in the parking lot, and called the police. Investigators soon identified the victim and determined she was last seen alive on the evening of February 27. Around 3:00 p.m. on March 1, a PennDOT road crew alerted State Police after discovering clothing strewn along a roadway in Butler County. State Police recovered a bra, blue jeans, a sock, a flannel long-sleeve shirt, thermal bottoms, a black slipper, a sock covered <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>in blood, a sweatshirt covered in blood, a blood-soaked pillow, a bloodstained cover for the arm of a couch, and a blood-covered tablecloth.</p>

She also had two broken ribs and bruising on her head, face, lower back, and legs. Dr. Smith determined the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.

The trial court concluded sufficient evidence supported the jury’s finding the Commonwealth had proven the aggravating circumstance of torture. The court noted the victim was missing for over 24 hours, suggesting her injuries could have been sustained over a prolonged time period. The victim sustained ten lacerations to her head and face, at least five of which were not likely to cause death, and most of those were not likely to cause unconsciousness; thus, the court believed it was likely the victim was conscious as appellant was striking her. The victim also suffered two broken ribs, four bruises on her lower lumbar area, two bruises on the front of her left leg, bruising on the front of her left thigh and left calf, a bruise on her right buttock, and a bruise on her left shoulder. The court found the victim’s injuries caused her a severe amount of pain which was “unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel,” supporting the jury’s finding appellant tortured her.

There is insufficient evidence from the manner of death to indicate appellant sought to torture the victim. Neither is there actual evidence regarding the duration of appellant’s attack, the order of the blows, or at what point in the attack the victim died. As such, there is insufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstance of torture. “If the Supreme Court determines that the death penalty must be vacated because none of the aggravating circumstances are supported by sufficient evidence, then it shall remand for the imposition of a life imprisonment sentence.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(4). Therefore, because there are no other aggravating circumstances to support appellant’s death sentence, we must vacate the death sentence and remand this case to the trial court for the imposition of a life sentence. As we are vacating appellant’s death sentence, we need not consider whether the sentence imposed was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. <em><a href="/a2d/756/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="756 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11244835,225979" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1130-01,/pa/562/0481-01">Id.,</a> </em>§ 9711(h)(3)(i)-(ii).</p>
