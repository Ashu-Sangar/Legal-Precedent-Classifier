Appellant fails to acknowledge that none of these witnesses recanted their identification of him as the shooter in their affidavits for the PCRA court, and the reason they had to be placed in protection programs was because they feared returning to the neighborhood where the murder occurred after they identified appellant.

Appellant claims he would have used these assets to pay the private attorney he had retained, but was instead forced to rely on appointed counsel, who was inadequately compensated and lacked the resources to defend a very complex, protracted matter involving multiple criminal prosecutions and forfeiture actions. The PCRA court held this claim was not cognizable under the PCRA, as claims based on civil forfeiture proceedings are not included in § 9543(a)(3)’s grounds for relief. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 15.

Trial counsel testified he stipulated to this evidence to avoid having the fact-finder hear such a gory recitation. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 3^4. Trial counsel did not actually stipulate to appellant’s presence at the scene; he merely agreed to the facts contained in the police report, which would have been admitted in a manner far more prejudicial to the defense had he not done so.

All these results showed was that someone had sex with the victim; there was nothing linking appellant to the rape. Furthermore, trial counsel called Michael Birdsong to testify, purportedly, that he was the one who committed the crimes; when Michael invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and did not testify, appellant argued on direct appeal that he should have been granted a continuance to present Michael’s testimony. We held, “[E]ven if Michael testified that it was he, not [ajppellant, that committed the crimes, this testimony would have been of little value in light of the testimony of the many eyewitnesses who knew [ajppellant and identified him as the shooter.” <em>Birdsong, </em>at 35.

Moreover, the absence of an on-the-record colloquy concerning the fundamentals of a trial by jury does not prove, in an absolute sense, that a defendant failed to understand the right he waived by proceeding non-jury. Consider, for example, a criminally-accused lawyer who waives a jury. Or, consider a career criminal defendant with previous, first-hand experience with jury trials. Or, imagine a reasonably intelligent client whose lawyer informed him, off the record, of the three basics of a jury trial. The record colloquy contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 620 serves a salutary prophylactic purpose, as it makes it plain that a jury waiver is knowing and voluntary, and it creates a record in the event of a later, collateral attack upon the waiver. For the same twin reasons, an on-the-record colloquy is a useful procedural tool whenever the waiver of any significant right is at issue, constitutional or otherwise, <em>e.g., </em>waiver of a trial, waiver of the right to counsel, waiver of the right to call witnesses, waiver of the right to cross-examine witnesses, waiver of rules-based speedy trial time limits, etc. But the colloquy does not share the same status as the right itself.</blockquote>

Despite appellant’s claim to the contrary, his decision to preclude Dr. Tepper’s testimony was not motivated by a perception that this expert was ill-prepared or conducted an inadequate assessment; his choice was driven by his desire not to have his low intelligence revealed, <em>see </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 123, a fact which was evident in appellant’s school and correctional records. According to trial counsel, had Dr. Tepper testified, he would have brought to light not only appellant’s limited intelligence, but also his family background and its impact on his development. Although Dr. Tepper did not agree with Drs. Maher and Lar<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>sen’s diagnosis of PTSD and substance-induced psychosis, it is doubtful the information in appellant’s school and correctional records would have altered Dr. Tepper’s conclusion. The school records reveal appellant’s severe emotional, disciplinary, and academic problems, but do not indicate any psychological disorders or suggest counseling other than placement in special education. The correctional records reflect low intelligence, immaturity, substance abuse, poor impulse control, and aggressive behavior, but specifically state, “There are no indications of any psychotic thought processes in this individual. Diagnostically he would appear to be a Personality Disorder, Passive-Aggressive Type.” 1978 Mental Health Evaluation by Marvin Strauss, Ph.D., Defendant’s Exhibit 28; <em>see also </em>1978 Pre-sentence Investigation by James Donaldson, Defendant’s Exhibit 28. Thus, we cannot say trial counsel’s investigation and preparation of mental health mitigating evidence, even if unreasonable, prejudiced appellant. As appellant’s underlying claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness fails, remand for further development of this claim concerning appellate counsel is unwarranted. <em>McGill, </em>at 1025.</p>

Dougherty, 585 </em>CAP, forwarding a global claim that this Court was “incapable of managing its capital docket.” In addition to various factual misrepresentations, the Defender’s federal motion blamed the Pennsylvania courts for state court delays in capital PCRA matters, without acknowledging the delays its litigation strategies had ensured in the very cases it cited. It is beyond coincidental, I suspect, that the reported cases detail at least two other instances where the Defender has raised <em>Atkins </em>claims, and then taken measures to avoid their determination. <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/610/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="18 A.3d 244" data-case-ids="4201975,7280594" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0017-01,/a3d/18/0244-01">18 A.3d at 340-42, 345-47</a> (Castille, C.J., joined by McCaffery, J., concurring), (discussing <em>Atkins </em>delays in <em>Commonwealth v.

Justice Saylor has accurately noted superficialities and weaknesses in various rulings and findings below, and in the Court’s review analysis here; and has highlighted some examples of problematic issues. On the other hand, as I have detailed in <em>Spotz, </em>I am mindful of the burden placed on the PCRA courts, and on this Court, by both the prolix filings of the Defender and their dubious litigation tactics, as revealed by the progress of the <em>Atkins </em>claim here, and the Defender’s conduct at the PCRA hearing. I agree that a more particularized approach should <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>be followed by our PCRA courts and by this Court on review, at least respecting claims that are not obviously baseless. But, I do not believe that the PCRA trial courts, or this Court, can or should have allocations of resources determined by the Defender’s litigation strategies. This is a delicate balance. In my view, the briefing reforms I suggested in <em>Spotz, </em>coupled with commensurate pleading reforms at the trial level to protect PCRA courts from abusive pleadings, may be the best way to ensure reasonable and rational review of non-frivolous claims.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[257,854,1150,1293]]]'>Having said this, and respecting the claims of concern to Justice Saylor, my own review of the record convinces me that appellant was given a fair opportunity to identify and develop his collateral claims, that there is no impediment to this Court deciding the appeal now, and that appellant clearly is not entitled to relief. Given the criminal conduct at issue (two killings, six additional wounded victims, rape, and other lesser offenses), and the overwhelming evidence, this was a difficult capital case for any trial attorney. Appellant plainly had a fair bench trial before Judge Stout. His various collateral claims either lack merit — including those instances where he seeks to fault counsel for his own decisions — or he has not come close to showing a reasonable probability that the result of the trial, or the penalty proceeding, would have been different but for the lapses that he attributes to his counsel. With particular respect to the penalty phase, I conclude that the nature and strength of the aggravators alone (significant history of violent felonies and multiple murders) militate against an award of <em>Strickland </em>relief. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>“every effort” perspective is in tension with the eleventh-hour mental health examination of Appellant — which counsel considered the heart of the penalty phase defense, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., Sept. 13, 1999, at 126 — occurring the evening before the penalty hearing. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 240-41, 24 A.3d at 341-42.</p>

In point of fact, no family member of Appellant’s was offered as a witness at the penalty hearing. Moreover, the truncated life-history presentation (comprised of two direct examinations covering a total of six pages of transcript), and counsel’s brief and substantially generic argument for life (covering three and one-half pages), reflect a disturbing recurrence we have seen in a number of these cases. <em>Cf.

I do not disagree that there was overzealousness on counsel’s part, but the record demonstrates that counsel’s efforts were, as often as not, responsive to misunderstandings generated by the PCRA court. For example, in the following illustrative passage, the PCRA court complained about the presentation of witnesses to which the Commonwealth had no objection; misdirectedly focused on guilt phase matters when the evidence was addressed to the penalty stage; and mischaracterized Appellant’s claims:</p>

I realize that the penalty presentation would have been longer had Appellant permitted the mental health professional to testify. A balanced assessment of this factor, however, would include consideration that Appellant (who undisputedly is of borderline intellect) was afforded very little time to process any information the psychologist was able to provide, and the expert had very little time to generate any trust and rapport with Appellant, as the examination occurred very late in the trial and on the eve of the penalty hearing. Moreover, frequently, a full development of the defendant's life history is necessary to serve as the factual predicate for the mental-health component of the testimony. Additionally, capital counsel bears the obligation to conduct a pre-trial investigation exploring all reasonably available avenues of mitigation. <em>See Commonwealth v.
