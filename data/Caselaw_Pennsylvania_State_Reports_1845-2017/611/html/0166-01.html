The Commonwealth maintains that in precluding hybrid representation, this Court made clear that a represented defendant on appeal has only two options: “(1) waive counsel and proceed pro se; or (2) proceed with appellate counsel and, if warranted, raise appellate counsel’s supposed ineffectiveness at a later date. But ‘the [one] thing he may not do’ is raise his own appellate claims while still represented by counsel.” <em>Id. </em>at 13 (quoting <em>Ellis II, </em><a href="/pa/534/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="534 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1839641" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0176-01">626 A.2d at 1141</a>). The Commonwealth posits that the Superior Court’s subsequent decision in <em>Battle </em>misinterpreted the scope of the holding in <em>Ellis II </em>as offering support for the proposition that whenever a defendant alleges ineffectiveness of appellate counsel on appeal, said counsel is required to petition the appellate court for remand. The Commonwealth submits that <em>Ellis II </em>did not involve claims of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness, as the grant of review was limited to the question of hybrid representation. Significantly, the Commonwealth notes that the Superior Court’s misinterpretation is highlighted by this Court’s explanation that once appellate counsel has filed a brief, an appellant’s right to petition to waive counsel and proceed <em>pro se </em>is prohibited. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Further, Appellee contends that the Commonwealth’s reliance on <em>Ellis II </em>is misplaced, as it is factually distinguishable.

Finally, the procedure could also engender remands for the appointment of new counsel <em>ad infinitum </em>if the client continues to disagree with subsequent counsel’s pursuit of less than all of the issues the client deems meritorious.</p>

The Superior Court’s misapprehension of our holding in <em>Ellis II </em>has created a unitary review paradigm that requires it to prematurely acknowledge, at least tacitly, that the issues foregone by counsel provide a more reasonable prospect for success, and counsel, therefore, is ineffective for not pursuing them, when it has yet to determine whether the actual claims advanced by counsel on appeal will provide an appellant with the relief he desires. Clearly, the requisite Strickland<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> prejudice cannot be established if counsel’s appellate advocacy ultimately carries the day. Thus, in this context, there can be no claim of ineffective assistance, and counsel need not be called upon to articulate a reasonable legal basis for not including the foregone claims. As we succinctly noted in <em>Ellis II, </em>“While criminal defendants often believe that the best way to pursue their appeals is by raising the greatest number of issues, actually, the opposite is true: selecting the few most important issues succinctly stated presents the greatest likelihood of success.” <em>Ellis II, </em><a href="/pa/534/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="534 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1839641" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0176-01">626 A.2d at 1140-41</a>.

Moreover, if an appellant remains adamant that the claims foregone by counsel provide the better chance for success, he can avoid the potential loss of those claims by timely exercising his desire to self-represent or retain private counsel prior to the appeal.

In accordance with <em>Battle, </em>the subject of the Petition was the performance of PCRA appeal counsel, with Jette faulting counsel for failing to indulge Jette’s whim to assert additional claims.

Rather than merely referring the <em>pro se </em>pleading to counsel for whatever action counsel might deem appropriate, as our decision in <em>Ellis </em>clearly would command, the panel, per <em>Battle, </em>ordered counsel to explain himself to the court. This is no trivial matter. When PCRA petitions are formally filed, the lawyer under attack is called upon to answer only if a sufficient proffer has been made to prove arguable merit and <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>
      <em>Strickland? </em>prejudice, and an issue of material fact concerning counsel’s strategy remains for resolution. The <em>Battle </em>procedure effectively incorporates a serial PCRA process, while casting aside the presumption that lawyers are effective. Moreover, the panel’s mandate, after the ensuing twenty month delay, included removal of PCRA appeal counsel and appointment of new counsel. It is pure fiction to treat: 1) the claim that PCRA appeal counsel was ineffective; 2) the process of an appellate court assuming the claim has merit and caused prejudice, and directing counsel to explain himself; and 3) the relief of ordering summary removal of counsel and remand — as encompassing mere review of “already-asserted PCRA claims.”</p>

But, even this goes too far: the reality here is that the claims appellee faulted his lawyer for failing to include may have been asserted in the PCRA court, but they were not asserted on appeal — until the Superior Court, through <em>Battle, </em>inserted itself into the client-counsel relationship and invited the client to file an appellate-level serial PCRA petition attacking his PCRA appeal counsel.

While this may be true in the abstract— assuming that foregone issues are, in fact, materially weaker than those actually litigated in an appeal — doubt is cast on such assumption in instances in which the claims actually advanced by counsel are adjudged to be meritless. To the degree there is difficulty in predicting which issues have the best chance of succeeding before an appellate court, the allocation to lawyers of the ability to forfeit meritorious claims seems highly questionable, at least in the absence of effective client consultation. The fairness of such allocation is particularly debatable in view of the barriers to judicial review of appellate-counsel stewardship, including the strong presumption of effectiveness and statutory and court-imposed limitations placed on the review.</p>

Thus, the rules for proceeding on direct appeal are clear. If an indigent appellant wishes to raise claims different from those that were chosen by his counsel, he must either: (1) file a petition to terminate counsel’s services and proceed with the appeal <em>pro se; </em>or (2) accept his counsel’s representation, and wait until collateral review to assert his claims of counsel’s ineffectiveness indirectly. <em><a href="/pa/534/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="534 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1839641" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0176-01">Id.</a> </em>The first option carries with it a time limitation: an appellant may not terminate counsel’s services and proceed <em>pro se </em>if counsel has already filed an appellate brief. <em>Commonwealth v.

Under the Majority’s new pronouncement, the petitioner may proceed <em>pro se </em>on a PCRA appeal at any time before his brief is filed. In my view, this line that we drew in <em>Rogers </em>should not be scribed in the same place for PCRA appeals. The original justification for the administrative imposition in <em>Rogers (i.e., </em>the ability to seek collateral relief) is largely illusory in the PCRA context, as a second round of relief is unlikely because of the jurisdictional nature of the PCRA’s time-bar, as inter<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>preted by this Court’s precedent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">1</a> Thus, under the Majority’s rule, if, for example, a PCRA appellant wishes to raise three claims that had been advanced but rejected by the PCRA court, and discovers that his appellate counsel has already filed a brief raising only one (or perhaps even none) of those claims, the omitted claims will escape review during disposition of the initial PCRA appeal under any circumstances, leaving the petitioner with the option of attempting to file a second PCRA petition, notwithstanding significant hurdles mentioned above.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">2</a>
