The children had testified at trial, unequivocally identifying Appellant as the individual who had shot their mother. Appellant had presented an alibi defense, attempted to undermine the credibility of the children’s testimony, and advanced the theory that the victim’s estranged husband was responsible for the murder. The jury returned a verdict of death, and on direct appeal, this Court affirmed both Appellant’s conviction and death sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth’s examination of Officer Starling concerning the investigative actions that police officers took shortly after responding to the scene of the murder elicited only very brief and general testimony regarding possible danger to Mr. Epps. Defense counsel — not the Commonwealth — elicited the acknowledgement from Officer Starling that Mr. Epps told police of Appellant’s threats to kill Mr. Epps. <em>See </em>quoted notes of testimony from 12/6/99, <em>supra. </em>During cross-examination of Officer Starling, defense counsel tried repeatedly to suggest that police officers went to Mr. Epps’s home immediately after the murder because he was a suspect. This line of questioning was entirely consistent with the narrative that defense counsel was attempting to develop at trial, <em>i.e., </em>that Appellant had intervened to protect the victim from Mr. Epps, her abusive, estranged husband, who ultimately was responsible for her murder. By suggesting now that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Officer Starling’s testimony, Appellant implicitly calls into question trial counsel’s overarching strategy and theory of the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

Appellant fails to suggest any reasonable grounds on which defense counsel could have or should have objected to the introduction of evidence of Appellant’s aliases. We conclude that there is no arguable merit to Appellant’s assertions of error with regard to Appellant’s aliases, and thus trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object.

The two attacks bore numerous similarities, including the fact that both victims were young Hispanic females. <em>Id. </em>at 841. Although we noted that the testimony of the sexual assault victim was vivid, graphic, highly prejudicial, and potentially emotional, we held that it was properly admitted because of its relevance to proving the appellant’s motive and intent and the absence of accident. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, we also held that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an appropriate limiting instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 842. We recognized that the highly inflammatory testimony of the prior sexual assault victim “created the substantial danger that the jury could be swayed in its deliberations ... by this evidence showing [the] appellant’s criminal character and his propensity to sexually assault young Hispanic females.” <em>Id. </em>at 841. In addition, we recognized that the evidence in question was not merely a fleeting or vague reference to the appellant’s criminal record, but rather was extensive as well as inflammatory, comprising a substantial component of the Commonwealth’s case and garnering an emphasis in closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 843. Accordingly, “[a]n appropriate limiting instruction ... would not have increased the jury’s awareness of the prior sexual assault, but it well might have placed its limited legal significance in proper perspective.” <em>Id. </em>at 843.

Some of the evidence was elicited as a single sentence in passing during cross-examination of the witnesses by defense counsel. In closing argument, the Commonwealth did make reference to Appellant’s abuse of the victim, but did not mention the other bad acts. <em>See </em>N.T., Commonwealth Closing Argument, 12/8/99, at 107. Under these circumstances, an instruction as to the bad acts evidence may very well have served only to re-emphasize the evidence to the jury. More importantly, Appellant has not established prejudice, <em>i.e., </em>he has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for the lack of a limiting instruction. We have previously noted the “overwhelming evidence” of Appellant’s guilt. <em>Hutchinson, </em><a href="/pa/571/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="811 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="1070156,9314501" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0045-01,/a2d/811/0556-01">811 A.2d at 562</a>. In light of this overwhelming evidence, which includes eyewitness testimony of the victim’s two children, both of whom knew Appellant, Appellant has failed to suggest how he could have been prejudiced by counsel’s failure to request a limiting instruction such that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. There is no merit to Appellant’s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness with regard to a limiting instruction, and therefore, the derivative claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness also fails.</p>

Appellant’s contention disregards or ignores many of the arguments that defense counsel did make during closing argument. Specifically, defense counsel argued that the children truly believed that Appellant had killed their <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>mother and thus were not really lying; that the children knew all the answers to the prosecutor’s questions, but could not answer most of defense counsel’s questions; that there were many inconsistencies in the children’s testimony; that, for a very short time after the murder, Mr. Epps was a suspect in the victim’s murder, and Mr. Epps gained the most from the victim’s death because of the ongoing divorce and custody actions; that “somebody else” may have influenced one of Philip’s statements, made in the context of comments centered around his father; that Desiree’s testimony may have been “tainted”; and that there was a “program” as to Philip’s testimony. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/8/99, at 75-76, 80, 83, 85-87. The clear implication from defense counsel’s comments was that the prosecutor had improperly coached the children prior to their testimony, and that Mr. Epps had a strong interest in deflecting blame for the victim’s death from himself to Appellant and did so by influencing his children’s testimony. Defense counsel’s theory that Mr. Epps had influenced the children’s identification of Appellant as the man who shot their mother was weakened by testimony of the victim’s sister. She testified that the children called her immediately after the murder and told her that Appellant had shot their mother; a 911 tape, played for the jury, was consistent with the aunt’s testimony. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/2/99, at 50-51; N.T., 12/3/99, at 122-24. The children’s call took place prior to the reuniting of the children with Mr. Epps. Defense counsel sought during his closing argument to cast doubt on the significance of the aunt’s testimony, as it was incompatible with his theory as to the genesis of the children’s testimony. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/8/99, at 76-77.

Consistent with this theory, defense counsel proffered an alibi witness; strongly challenged the credibility of the testimony of the victim’s children and sister; and questioned the investigation of the police officers at the scene, including their motivation for going to Mr. Epp’s home after the murder. All of this evidence was summarized in defense counsel’s closing argument. Counsel’s individual arguments and his overall strategy would have been undermined and the jury confused had counsel appended to his closing an aside that the shooter must not have acted with intent to kill, because the shots were not fired at close range. There is no merit to Appellant’s allegation that time limitations prevented trial counsel from arguing the significance of the medical examiner’s testimony as to the issue of specific intent. Certainly, counsel did not argue specific intent — but the reasons for not doing so had nothing to do with time limitations.</p>

N.T. Suppression Hearing, 11/24/99, at 5-6. When the prosecutor stated that he would prefer not to put the victim’s children on <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>the stand at the suppression hearing, the court assured him that he was free to call whichever witness he wanted to establish that the children had an independent basis for their identification of Appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 4.

Contrary to Appellant’s assertions, nothing in the court’s words or actions suggested bias against Appellant or pre-judgment of his guilt.
