Morack continued her employment with Gentex until 2005, when she left her position due to pain in her hands. Specifically, when Morack was initially hired in 1960, she worked as a lens inspector of Air Force helmets, which required her to inspect the lenses before they were installed on the helmets. After roughly ten years in that position, she moved on to inspecting the sewing on the entire helmet, and performed that job for the next 33 years. In 2003, Morack’s duties increased and, in addition to her job in the sewing department, she began working as a final inspector on all parts of the helmet, a position that required her to handle many, sometimes hundreds, of helmets per day, each helmet weighing as much as nine pounds. In order to fulfill her increased duties, Morack began arriving at work an hour earlier every day, alternating between the sewing department and final inspection.</p>

Ultimately, on January 17, 2005, the pain in Morack’s hands overwhelmed her and she informed her supervisor, Claire Lewis, that she could no longer tolerate the pain and would have to leave work. Morack made an appointment with Dr. Morro<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>same day, and he issued her a note excusing her from work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Morack testified she delivered the note to Gentex’s guardhouse, and, pursuant to Gentex’s policy, Morack telephoned Gentex for the next five days to update Gentex on her condition, each day indicating that she could not work because of swelling in her hands. Morack also applied for short-term disability benefits on February 2, 2005. On the short-term disability application form, Morack indicated that she did not believe her injury was work-related.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> She listed as her ailments swelling in her arms, hands, knees, and ankles, and attributed these to pre-existing fibromyalgia and high blood pressure, which were diagnosed in 1993.</p>

Dr. Grady ruled out fibromyalgia and high blood pressure as the cause of Morack’s hand injuries, and concluded her injuries were work-related. On March 24, 2005, Dr. Grady released Morack to return to work with a limitation of no repetitive lifting of more than one pound or continuous standing for longer than 45 minutes. No such position was made available to Morack by Gentex, and Morack’s employment was subsequently terminated.</p>

Morack stated that she left “messages on her machine galore,” but was never able to speak with Montefor or anyone from the Human Resources Department regarding her injuries. N.T.

The WCJ found in favor of Morack, concluding that she suffered a work-related injury on January 17, 2005, the day she informed her supervisor that she could no longer work because of pain in her hands. The WCJ credited Morack’s testimony over that presented by Montefor, and found that once Morack was examined by Dr. Grady and knew her problems were work-related, she complied with the Act’s notice provisions by timely notifying Gentex that her injuries were work-related pursuant to Sec<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>tion 311 of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Moreover, and of particular relevance herein, the WCJ concluded that, based on her prior complaints of hand pain, her short-term disability form, and her voice message left for Montefor, Morack sufficiently described her injuries pursuant to Section 312, which requires that the employee inform the employer that the employee “received an injury, described in ordinary language, in the course of his employment on or about a specified time, at or near a place specified.” 77 P.S. § 632. Accordingly, the WCJ concluded that Morack gave timely and adequate notice under the Act, and awarded Morack weekly compensation benefits of $432.11.</p>

The Board noted Morack initially was unsure if her injuries were work-related, but, upon learning from Dr. Grady that they were, in fact, work-related, she telephoned Montefor and left a message indicating she had “work-related problems.” The Board observed that the WCJ credited Morack’s testimony over that presented by Gentex, and deferred to that determination. As such, the Board concluded that Morack provided adequate notice of her work-related injuries, and therefore affirmed the WCJ’s award of benefits.</p>

In a published panel opinion, authored by Judge James Flaherty, the court acknowledged that the record was unclear regarding whether Morack actually notified Gentex within 120 days of Dr. Grady’s diagnosis, but recognized, because Morack was the party prevailing below, she was entitled to all reasonable inferences from the evidence. <em>Gentex Corp. v.

Specifically, the court focused on Morack’s short-term disability form and her voice message to Montefor indicating she had “work-related problems.” The court noted that Morack’s short-term disability form stated she did not believe her injuries were work-related, complained of ailments and referred to body parts not at issue in this litigation, and attributed those ailments to pre-existing fibromyalgia and high blood pressure. Additionally, the court determined Morack’s voice message did not alleviate the uncertainty regarding her injuries, as her message did not specifically indicate what body part she was referring to, what ailment was work-related, or whether her “work-related problems” were injuries at all. Accordingly, the court concluded that, even accepting Morack’s testimony as credible, she failed to provide Gentex with a reasonable description of her work-related injuries as required by Section 312. Thus, the court reversed the Board’s decision upholding the WCJ’s award of benefits.</p>

Morack analogizes the instant matter to those cases, and avers that she immediately notified her supervisor that she could not work because of pain in her hands, initially stated she was not sure if her injury was work-related, but ultimately left a voice message indicating that she, in fact, had suffered a work-related injury. Morack further argues that Gentex knew or should have known of her injury, and the potential it was work-related, from her prior complaints of hand pain while at work, her subsequent short-term disability form, and her voice message. Morack claims the decision of the WCJ that she complied with all applicable notice provisions should be given deference, and notes that, as the prevailing party before the WCJ, she is entitled to all reasonable inferences arising from the evidence presented. Morack contends the Commonwealth Court, while adhering to that standard with respect to evaluating the timeliness of her notice under Section 311, abandoned it when considering whether she complied with Section 312. Finally, Morack maintains the Commonwealth Court erred by not holding Gentex to its burden to investigate the circumstances of the injury. Morack reiterates that, once she left the voice message indicating she had work-related problems, coupled with her previous complaints of hand pain, Gentex knew or should have known she suffered an injury that was at least potentially work-related, and, therefore, should have investigated the matter, or, at a minimum, contacted her for clarification. She asserts that Gentex failed to respond to her communications in any way and, therefore, failed to fulfill its duty to investigate.</p>

Gentex avers the message left by Morack did not identify her injury, and was, therefore, insufficient to satisfy Section 312. Gentex claims the phrase “work-related problems” could <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>have meant any number of things, including that Morack was not receiving her short-term disability payments or her health care benefits. Gentex also argues Morack’s short-term disability form is insufficient to satisfy Section 312 because Morack did not establish who received the short-term disability paperwork. Indeed, Gentex suggests the short-term disability paperwork could have gone directly to Gentex’s short-term disability insurance carrier. Moreover, Gentex notes the short-term disability form also referred to body parts and conditions not at issue in this litigation, and indicated Morack’s belief that her ailments were not work-related. Gentex acknowledges Morack informed her supervisor on January 17, 2005 that her hands were hurting and that she could not continue working, but asserts that, because she did not learn her injuries were work-related until much later, her initial complaints of hand pain cannot suffice under Section 312. Finally, Gentex contends its duty to investigate the circumstances surrounding Morack’s injury was not triggered until it actually received her claim petition, because, prior to receiving that petition, the injury was not reported to, or known by, Gentex.</p>

So viewed, PAJ argues Morack satisfied the requirements of Section 312 by leaving the voice message for Montefor. PAJ asserts that Gentex knew Morack had complained of hand pain in the past as a result of her having to leave work on January 17, 2005. Coupled with her voice message and short-term disability form, and viewing the evidence in favor of Morack, as the injured employee, PAJ contends Gentex knew of her injury and was aware of the possibility it was work-related. Therefore, PAJ asserts, Morack complied with Section 312 and should be awarded benefits.</p>

Sections 311 and 312 of the Act govern the timing and content of the notice, respectively. Section 311 provides that an employee has 120 days from the date of the injury, or from the date the employee learns the injury is work-related, to provide notice to the employer of the work-related injury. 77 P.S. § 631. Section 312, at issue in this appeal, requires that the notice “inform the employer that a certain employe received an injury, described in ordinary language, in the course of his employment on or about a specified time, at or near a place specified.” 77 P.S. § 632. Thus, the plain language of the statute sets forth, generally, what is required of an injured employee when informing the employer of a work-related injury. Section 312 does not speak, however, to the determination of whether notice is adequate.

The claimant attempted to do so, but was unable to contact anyone from the union.

Important to this appeal, our Court stressed, “[w]hile [the claimant] admits that [his] notice was not letter perfect, we adopt the reasoning of the Superior Court that a meritorious claim ought not, if possible[,] be defeated[,] for technical reasons and technicalities are not looked upon with favor in compensation cases.” <em>Katz, </em><a href="/pa/485/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="485 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="1755372" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0536-01">485 Pa. at 541</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="485 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="1755372" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0536-01">403 A.2d at 520</a> (internal quotations omitted).

Once she learned from Dr. Grady that her injuries were work-related, however, she informed Gentex via voice message in Montefor’s voice mailbox that she had “work-related problems.” Gentex thus was aware Morack suffered a work-related problem, and knew she had not returned to work since January 17, 2005, when she left work complaining of her hand injuries. Although Morack’s short-term disability form indicated she did not believe her injuries were work-related and listed additional ailments, she was not aware of her medical diagnosis or that her injury, was work-related until she subsequently saw Dr. Grady. Gentex was aware Morack complained specifically of pain in her hands on January 17, 2005, had not returned to work since that specific complaint, and subsequently indicated she had work-related problems.

Related to an employee’s burden to provide notice to an employer regarding a work-related injury, Section 406.1(a) of the Act states, in relevant part, the employer "shall promptly investigate each injury reported or known to the employer and shall proceed promptly to commence payment of compensation due.’’ 77 P.S. § 717.1(a). That section further provides the first installment of compensation "shall be paid not later than the twenty-first day after the employer has notice or knowledge of the employe’s disability." <em><a href="/pa/592/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="927 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="3555692,8396986" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0625-01,/a2d/927/0209-01">Id.</a> </em>Failure by the employer to promptly investigate an injury constitutes a violation of the Act, which, in turn, can result in the imposition of penalties against the employer under Section 435(d)(i). <em>See Geiger v. WCAB (Circle Fine Art Corp.), </em><a href="/a2d/654/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="654 A.2d 19" data-case-ids="7859317" data-case-paths="/a2d/654/0019-01">654 A.2d 19</a>, 21 (Pa.Cmwlth.1994) (penalties imposed on employer where employer did not investigate the employee’s injury until nine months after it was notified of her claim).</p>

Critically, Section 406.1(a)'s prompt investigation requirement is triggered not only when a claim petition is filed, but when the injury is “reported or known to the employer.” 77 P.S. § 717.1(a).

I write simply to observe, as an aside, that the challenge made by Gentex and/or its insurance carrier (collectively referred to as “Gentex”) strikes me as a troubling example of what I view as inappropriate corporate conduct. Ms. Morack joined Gentex in 1960, immediately out of high school, and loyally served in three progressively more important positions for the next 45 years, often working after-hours to complete the more demanding tasks asked of her. Rather than acknowledging the undisputed genesis of her injuries and paying her the due compensation, Gentex opted to pursue a technical defense in the hope of avoiding its rightful obligations. It is unfortunate that someone in corporate management chose to pursue this regrettable course.</p>
