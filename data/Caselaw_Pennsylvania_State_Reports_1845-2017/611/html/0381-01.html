C.S.A. § 7508(a)(7)(i) of the Crimes Code. We hold that the trial court erred in finding that a single purchase of one bundle of packets of heroin from a third person, who retrieved the bundle from a parked Buick automobile, coupled with Appellant Omar Johnson’s immediate resale of that bundle to an undercover officer, formed an adequate basis for its conclusion that Appellant was in constructive possession of a second bundle of packets of heroin stored inside of the Buick discovered during a subsequent police search of it. Accordingly, because the amount of heroin seized from the Buick was erroneously included by the trial court in the calculation of the total amount of heroin Appellant was found to have possessed with intent to deliver, thereby resulting in an improper imposition of a mandatory minimum term of three years imprison<a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>ment under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 7508(a)(7)(i), we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>

Rather, Appellant avers that this case involves the interpretation of the text of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 7508, which he contends does not include for sentencing purposes quantities of drugs that are the object of a conspiracy conviction unless the defendant has manufactured them or actually or constructively possessed them with intent to deliver. He notes that 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 7508(a)(1) applies only when the defendant is convicted of violating Section 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substances, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, and that section prohibits the manufacture, delivery, or possession of heroin with intent to manufacture or deliver it. Appellant points out that Section 13(a)(30) does not, however, include either a conspiracy conviction or conspiratorial liability. Appellant references our Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant maintains that in <em>Hoke </em>we held that another mandatory sentencing statute, 35 P.S. § 780-113(k), did not apply to the crime of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, as the statute, by its terms, restricted the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence to only the crime of manufacturing methamphetamine.

This evidence as supplied by Officer Gramlich’s testimony, even when viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, including all reasonable inferences therefrom, showed only that: Appellant phoned Wilson to request a single bundle of heroin. When Appellant arrived with Officer Gramlich at Wilson’s location, Appellant exited Gramlich’s car and had a conversation with Wilson, which occurred on a public street corner. After engaging in this conversation, Wilson returned to the Buick while Appellant remained standing on the street corner. Appellant did not accompany Wilson to the Buick. While Appellant was standing on the street corner, Wilson entered the Buick, retrieved the bundle of heroin from the glove box area, and returned to where Appellant was standing on the street corner. After Appellant obtained the money from Officer Gramlich, he delivered that money and other money in his pocket to Wilson, again remaining outside of the Buick. Later, when Wilson was arrested, he was discovered with the keys to the Buick in his pocket.</p>

Majority Opinion (Todd, J.), Op. 404, 26 A.3d at 1092 (emphasis added).

In my view, the majority has failed to acknowledge the significance of evidence supporting a broader conspiracy, and thus has not credited the trial court’s finding that Appellant and Mr. Wilson “were actively engaging in an ongoing criminal conspiracy to sell heroin.” Trial Court Opinion, filed 5/26/06, at 6.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[178,971,1156,1009]]]'>The evidence from which I believe one can infer a broader conspiracy can be summarized as follows. The undercover officer had purchased heroin from Appellant on three different days by calling his cell phone number and arranging a pickup, which was always, at Appellant’s direction, on the corner of Seventh Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia. On July 6, 2004, the day of the last purchase, when the undercover officer asked Appellant for yet another bundle of heroin, Appellant immediately made a phone call to request it; he then reentered the officer’s car, and directed him to drive a couple of blocks to where Mr. Wilson was waiting in his parked car. After Appellant and Mr. Wilson spoke briefly on the street corner and shook hands, the latter returned to his car to get a bundle of heroin from the glove compartment. Mr. Wilson gave the heroin to Appellant, who in turn gave it to the officer in exchange for $120 in pre-recorded buy money. Appellant then gave the buy money, as well as additional money from his pocket, to Mr. Wilson. Majority Opinion, at 386-87, 26 A.3d at 1081-82; Trial Court Opinion at 1-2.</p>

One can also reasonably infer that Mr. Wilson was working his drug trade in the same neighborhood as Appellant, because he was waiting in his parked car, with heroin packets, when Appellant and the officer arrived from only a couple of blocks away right after Appellant made the phone call to obtain the heroin. <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>When the officer made his additional and unexpected request of Appellant for more heroin on the day in question, Appellant was immediately able to make contact with Mr. Wilson and to obtain from him the heroin sought by the officer. Tellingly, at the end of the transaction, Appellant gave Mr. Wilson more than the $120 paid by the officer for the heroin packets just purchased; Appellant also took other money from his pocket and gave that to Mr. Wilson as well.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[274,754,1151,1517]]]'>From these circumstances, I cannot conclude, as does the majority, that the interaction between Appellant and Mr. Wilson was nothing more than a single drug transaction. Appellant may very well have been, as the majority characterizes him, a freelance middleman who obtained heroin for buyers from not just Mr. Wilson, but from whatever source was convenient and available. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 405-06, 26 A.3d at 1092-93. But this <em>modus operandi </em>is certainly not incompatible with the existence of one or more ongoing conspiratorial relationships. In fact, a “retailer” of heroin who serves as a middleman between the ultimate consumers and a number of different sources would appear likely to be engaged in numerous conspiracies to sell heroin. In my view, the above evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that Appellant and Mr. Wilson were actively engaged in an ongoing criminal conspiracy to sell heroin. Accordingly, because a conspirator is legally responsible for any acts committed by his fellow co-conspirator to further the purpose of the conspiracy, including those acts committed in the course of preparation for the crime agreed upon, <em>see Roux, </em><a href="/pa/465/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="465 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1712658" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0482-01">350 A.2d at 871-72</a>; <em>Eiland, </em><a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20651" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="301 A.2d 651">301 A.2d at 653</a>; <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.2d%20255" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="189 A.2d 255">189 A.2d at 258</a>, I would conclude that the heroin found in Mr. Wilson’s car was attributable to Appellant as a co-conspirator. It is eminently foreseeable as a natural consequence of an unlawful agreement to sell heroin that a co-conspirator would remain in the vicinity of the distribution site, equipped with heroin packets in his parked vehicle. Mr. Wilson did just that. Appellant, as his co-conspirator, should be criminally liable for the heroin found in Mr. Wilson’s car.</p>
