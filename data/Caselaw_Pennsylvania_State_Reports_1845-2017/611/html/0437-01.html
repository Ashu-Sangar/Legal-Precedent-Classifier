Moreover, the panel rejected the Commonwealth’s claim that appellee had waived any sentencing complaint by failing to file a post-sentence motion before taking his <em>pro se </em>appeal, noting that the trial court had later received a timely motion from counsel. The panel noted that the “rationale applies especially” where defense counsel has no knowledge of the <em>pro se </em>filing and the trial court clerk fails to forward a time-stamped copy of the <em>pro se </em>filing to counsel as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 576(A)(4).</p>

The panel added that the procedure assumes particular importance where, as here, a defendant raises a discretionary sentencing claim, which cannot be raised for the first time on direct appeal. Thus, the panel both quashed the appeal and remanded to the trial court with a directive to hold a hearing to address the merits of the counseled post-sentence motion. The panel recognized that Judge Means had already denied the post-sentence motion, and written a Rule 1925(a) opinion supporting the sentence imposed. Nevertheless, the panel felt that there was nothing in the opinion to indicate that Judge Means had considered the post-sentence motion on its merits or held a hearing, since he denied it “just three days after it was filed.” The panel also noted that Judge Means had erroneously stated in his <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>opinion that appellee had been convicted of aggravated assault on March 27, 2008, which was actually the date the VOP sentence was imposed.

According to the Commonwealth, both in <em>Mincavage </em>and here, the Superior Court held that a counseled post-sentence motion filed after a defendant files a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal renders the notice of appeal premature. The Commonwealth invokes Pa.R.Crim.P. 720, which provides, in relevant part: “If the defendant does not file a timely post-sentence motion, the defendant’s notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days of imposition of sentence ...” Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(3). The Commonwealth argues that this Rule does not contemplate or provide for the consideration of a defendant’s post-sentence motion filed after his own notice of appeal. The Commonwealth notes that the <em>Mincavage </em>panel relied on the Explanatory Comment to Rule 720.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> But, the Commonwealth argues, the comment actually directs <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>a contrary result because its plain language specifically provides that it is the Commonwealth’s post-sentence motion that will render a defendant’s notice of appeal premature; the comment does not contemplate that the defendant can render his own notice premature. In <em>Mincavage, </em>the Commonwealth claims, the Superior Court read the word “Commonwealth” in the comment to Criminal Rule 720 as if it said the “Commonwealth or the defendant,” a reading that obviously is not supported by the comment’s language.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[276,814,1148,635]],["BL_505.1",505,[196,317,1153,1066]],["BL_506.1",506,[257,319,1146,149]]]'>The Commonwealth further contends that the Superior Court’s decision ignores the rationale behind the Explanatory Comment, which is that a party cannot forestall consideration of the opponent’s post-sentence motion by filing a snap notice of appeal before the time for filing a post-sentence motion expires. The Commonwealth adds that Criminal Rule 721, governing Commonwealth challenges to a sentence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> includes an identical, corresponding Explanatory Comment, which notes that the Commonwealth’s notice of appeal is to be deemed premature if the defendant files a timely post-sentence motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The Commonwealth claims that, when read together, Rules 720 and 721 make the governing rationale <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>clear: the Rules contemplate that a party, whether the defendant or the Commonwealth, must decide between filing a notice of appeal or a post-sentence motion, and once that choice is made, the filing party cannot then elect to follow the unchosen path in addition to the chosen one. Once a party files a post-sentence motion, the Commonwealth argues, it cannot file a notice of appeal until the motion is resolved by a final order or denied by operation of law; and conversely, a party filing a notice of appeal cannot then file a post-sentence motion because the notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over a post-sentence motion. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1701(a) (except as otherwise prescribed, after an appeal is taken, the trial court may no longer proceed further in the matter); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5505 (“Except as otherwise provided or prescribed by law, a court upon notice to the parties may modify or rescind any order within 30 days after its entry ... if no appeal from such order has been taken or allowed.”). Further, the Commonwealth argues, Rules 720 and 721 provide that a party cannot be denied the option of litigating a post-sentence motion by the party opponent’s decision to file a <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>notice of appeal. According to the Commonwealth, the Rules plainly do not allow a party to render his own notice of appeal invalid by filing a subsequent post-sentence motion.</p>

In accordance with the Rules, the Commonwealth argues, appellee’s counseled post-sentence motion was a nullity when filed because appellee had already filed a notice of appeal, divesting the trial court of jurisdiction to entertain a post-sentence motion. The Commonwealth acknowledges the complication, highlighted by the Superior Court panel, that appellee filed his notice of appeal <em>pro se </em>and without his counsel’s knowledge, but argues that the circumstance is immaterial to what it views as a question of jurisdiction. Further, the Commonwealth avers, the Rules draw no distinction between <em>pro se </em>filings and counseled filings.</p>

The Commonwealth claims that the basis for this distinction is obvious. Among the most <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>frequently raised claims under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 <em>et seq., </em>are claims that counsel failed to file a requested notice of appeal. To require a clerk of court to determine in which instances a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal results from the abandonment of the defendant by counsel and which are duplicative or the result of hybrid representation would severely overburden the trial court. The Commonwealth concludes that there is nothing in the Rules of Criminal or Appellate Procedure distinguishing between <em>pro se </em>and counseled notices of appeal; thus, appellee’s appeal should not have been quashed and remanded for further consideration of the later-filed counseled post-sentence motion. Instead, the Commonwealth argues, the Superior Court should have decided appellee’s <em>pro se </em>appeal on the merits, and as if no post-sentence motion had been filed.</p>

He argues that Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(3) authorizes a trial court, after an appeal has been filed, to grant reconsideration of the order that is the subject of the appeal if a motion is filed in the trial court within the applicable time limit and an order granting reconsideration is entered by the trial court within the permitted time period. Where this scenario occurs, according to appellee, the timely order granting reconsideration renders the notice of appeal inoperative. Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(3). Appellee further claims that the comments to Rule 1701 explain that subsection (b)(3) is intended to cover the exact situation presented in this case — under such circumstances, the trial court is permitted to grant reconsideration where reconsideration is sought during the applicable appeal period and the Rule eliminates the possibility that the power to grant reconsideration is foreclosed by a speedy appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

According to appellee, under Rule 1701(b)(3), the trial court retained jurisdiction to reconsider his sentence because his post-sentence motion was filed within 10 days of the imposition of sentence as required by Criminal Rule 720(A)(1). Further, appellee claims, the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration within 30 days of appellee’s post-sentence motion, at which time, the <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal was perfected without need for further action by appellee or his counsel.</p>

He argues that, while the Commonwealth is correct that Rules 720 and 721 govern the timing of the filing of post-sentence motions by either party, and the filing of an appeal in the absence of or following disposition of post-sentence motions, the Commonwealth’s argument ignores the plain language of Rule 1701(b)(3), which provides a jurisdictional exception to the general rule that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction. This exception, appellee claims, allows a trial court to decide a timely post-sentence motion that is filed simultaneously with or subsequent to a notice of appeal.

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[194,429,1151,1372]]]'>Appellee further claims that the holdings in this case and <em>Mincavage </em>are consistent with Appellate Rule 3304, which provides that a <em>pro se </em>filing by a represented defendant in this Court should not be docketed but rather should be forwarded to counsel of record, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Ellis, </em><a href="/pa/534/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="534 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1839641" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0176-01">534 Pa. 176</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="534 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1839641" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0176-01">626 A.2d 1137</a> (1993). According to appellee, both Rule 3304 and <em>Ellis </em>prohibit the court from even accepting <em>pro se </em>filings by a represented defendant in the interest of promoting judicial economy in the appellate courts. Appellee bases his argument on <em>Ellis’s </em>holding that a criminal defendant has no right to hybrid representation in either the trial or the appellate courts. Instead, a represented defendant who wishes to proceed <em>pro se </em>must demonstrate to the trial court that he is waiving his right to counsel knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, and absent such a showing, counsel must continue to represent the defendant through the disposition of the case, including appellate review. Appellee claims that a defendant’s <em>pro se </em>filings have no legal effect while the defendant is represented by counsel.

While the appeal on the bail issue was pending, the defendant was tried and convicted on charges relating to passing bad checks. The question before the Court was whether the trial court could proceed with trial on the merits after the defendant filed his <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal of the bail question, despite Rule 1701. The Court concluded that, because the subject matter of the appeal was distinct from the charges for which the defendant was tried, Rule 1701 did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction.</p>
      <p id="b518-8" data-blocks='[["BL_518.7",518,[293,1486,1120,862]]]'>Respectfully, we believe that <em>Piscanio </em>is distinguishable from this case for several reasons. First, the legal nullity language relied upon by the Dissent was not part of the holding in <em>Piscanio, </em>but rather confined to a footnote noting that the defendant was never granted leave to proceed <em>pro se; </em>therefore, his <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal from the denial of bail was deemed a legal nullity. Second, the criminal proceedings.in <em>Piscanio </em>were ongoing, and the fact of the defendant's continued representation by counsel apparently was clear. This case involves a notice of appeal from a final judgment of sentence. Given that our cases have recognized that a criminal defendant has a right to self-representation on appeal, <em>see Commonwealth v. Grazier, </em><a href="/pa/552/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="552 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="559293,559404" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0009-01,/pa/552/0009-02">552 Pa. 9</a>, <a href="/a2d/713/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="713 A.2d 81" data-case-ids="11805007,559404" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/0081-01,/pa/552/0009-02">713 A.2d 81</a> (1998); <em>but see Commonwealth v.

This is particularly so in the case of retained counsel. Finally, an appeal from the denial of bail is interlocutory (and collateral to the main issues at trial), while an appeal from a judgment of sentence is not.

While Rule 576 states that the clerk “shall accept [a <em>pro se </em>notice] for filing, time stamp it with the date of receipt and make a docket entry reflecting the date of receipt, and place the document in the criminal case file,” Pa.R.Crim.P. Rule 576(A)(4), the commentary emphasizes that the filing is docketed as purely an evidentiary matter: “The requirement that the clerk time stamp and make docket entries of the filings in these cases only serves to provide a record of the filing, and does not trigger any deadline nor require any response.” <em>Id. </em>cmt.

      <em>See </em>Pa. R.A.P. 1701(a) (“Except as otherwise prescribed by these rules, after an appeal is taken or review of a quasijudicial order is sought, the trial court or other government unit may <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>no longer proceed further in the matter.”). Here, the <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal was not interlocutory, as it was undoubtedly an appeal from a final order — the judgment of sentence. Thus, under Pa.R.A.P. 1701, that appeal, if given any legal effect, would have stripped the trial court of jurisdiction, and thereby preventing the trial court from entertaining the post-sentence motion later filed by the Appellee’s counsel. Indeed, had <em>counsel </em>filed the first notice of appeal, there would presumably be no question about this. While a counseled appeal, filed prior to a post-sentence motion, certainly would have handicapped any sentencing-based issues on appeal, <em>see Commonwealth v. Reeves, </em><a href="/a2d/778/0691-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="778 A.2d 691" data-case-ids="9496743" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/0691-01">778 A.2d 691</a>, 692 (Pa.Super.2001) (failure to file post-sentence motion waived appellate challenge to discretionary aspect of a sentence), it would not have been interlocutory.</p>

In this regard, I do not find the majority’s analogy to our treatment of other premature appeals to be persuasive. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 458-59, 27 A.3d at 1007-OS (citing, <em>inter alia, K.H. v. J.R., </em><a href="/pa/573/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="573 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="197151" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0481-01">573 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="826 A.2d 863" data-case-ids="197151,197223,9111783,9111843" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0481-01,/pa/573/0479-01,/a2d/826/0863-01,/a2d/826/0863-02">826 A.2d 863</a> (2003)). In <em>K.H., </em>this Court allowed the fiction that an otherwise <em>interlocutory </em>appeal, one filed before the entry of a final order (the civil judgment) would be viewed as having been filed after the entry of final judgment, thus maturing the appeal once judgment was entered. <em>See also </em>Pa.R.A.P. 905(a)(5) (“A notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a determination <em>but before the entry of an appealable order </em>shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof.” (emphasis added)). In cases of interlocutory appeals, Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(6) specifically authorizes the trial court’s continuing jurisdiction. Thus, the court is jurisdiction-ally authorized to enter judgment, and there is no impediment to deeming its act of entering judgment as the trigger for maturing the interlocutory appeal — that is, throughout the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>process, the trial court’s jurisdiction is secure. The same is not true under the majority’s approach: our appellate rules presently do not contemplate treating the instant <em>pro se </em>appeal, taken from a final order, as “premature,” or somehow ineffective.</p>

The proper way to view the <em>pro se </em>appeal, after the counseled appeal was dismissed, is as a premature appeal that was perfected upon the trial court’s proper consideration and denial of the counseled post-sentence motions.”).

In observing that this reasoning was somehow not part of our holding in <em>Piscanio, see </em>Majority Opinion at 458 n. 19, 27 A.3d at 1007 n. 19, the majority overlooks our explicit statement to the contrary: “This claim [by the Commonwealth that Appellant was still represented by counsel] presents an <em>alternative basis </em>on which to find that the trial court properly proceeded with Appellee's trials.’’ <em>Piscanio, </em><a href="/pa/530/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="530 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1832980" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0293-01">530 Pa. at </a>298 n. 3, <a href="/pa/530/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="530 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1832980" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0293-01">608 A.2d at </a>1029 n. 3 (emphasis added). Further, as I discuss below, I am unpersuaded by the majority’s attempt to diminish the import of this case because of the ease with which the fact of hybrid representation was discernible. <em>See infra </em>note 6.</p>

Rule 576 required <em>pro se </em>filings not be docketed, but merely forwarded to record counsel, and now the Rule provides that such filings should be docketed. <em>Compare </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 576(C) (2003) <em>with </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 576(A)(4). As discussed <em>infra, </em>however, commentary to the amended Rule emphasizes the purely evidentiary nature of the docketing requirement.</p>

Although Rule 576 does not specify, I presume the <em>pro se </em>filing is recorded so that it may, for example, be considered in determining a litigant's entitlement to <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief, as such a filing would be relevant in assessing a claim that the defendant intended for counsel to file an appeal.</p>

The majority contends that the prothonotary’s failure in the instant case to follow this rule by forwarding the notice of appeal on to counsel undermines this conclusion. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 456 n. 15, 27 A.3d at 1006 n. 15. I disagree. While the rule was not followed herein, and while this failure would factor into a grant of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief as I discuss below, a failure to adhere to a rule in any given case cannot drive this Court’s overall interpretation of our procedural rules.</p>

The majority rightly notes that, if one party — be it the Commonwealth or the defendant — files a notice of appeal and then a timely post-sentence motion is filed <em>by the other party, </em>Rule 720 and 721 of our criminal rules render the notice of appeal premature. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 451-53, 27 A.3d at 1003-04; Pa.R.Crim.P. 720 &amp; 721. As the majority further emphasizes, however, this feature of Rule 720 and 721 has no application herein.</p>

As a distinguishing point, the majority emphasizes that in this case, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 456 n. 16, 27 A.3d at 1006 n. 16, and in <em>Piscanio </em>and <em>Ali, see </em>Majority Opinion at 458 n. 19, 27 A.3d at 1007 n. 19, the hybrid nature of the defendants’ representation was easily determinable, implying that such is not normally the case. In this regard, however, it is unclear to me what more is required of a court’s prothonotary, in reviewing a <em>pro se </em>filing, than to review the relevant court dockets — specifically, for counsel’s entry of appearance or appointment, and to see whether any motion to withdraw has been <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>granted. While, as the majority notes, a criminal defendant has the right to self-representation, such a right is not self-executing, requires court approval, and would be readily discernible on the relevant docket. Indeed, in the case of appointed counsel, our criminal rules require counsel, unless leave to withdraw is granted, to retain his appointment up to and through any appeal to this Court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 122(B)(2) &amp; cmt. Admittedly, for retained counsel, our rules are arguably ambiguous (and worth clarifying) in this regard. <em>Compare </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 120(A)(4) (counsel must "continue such representation through .direct appeal or until granted leave to withdraw”) <em>with </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 120(B)(1) (counsel "may not withdraw his or her appearance except by leave of court”). Regardless, I am unpersuaded by the majority's implication that determining whether a defendant is represented at any given time is an involved matter. Indeed, of particular relevance for this case, a notice of appeal is filed in the trial court, not the appellate court, Pa.R.A.P. 905(a)(1); thus, in this case, the review I am suggesting implicates only one court docket.</p>
