The court determined § 5793(a)’s “or otherwise” language expanded the class of persons covered by the provision beyond those expressly enumerated, but that those additional individuals must be of the same “class[ ] of person[ ] of the same general nature as an officer, director or member, but not limited to persons in those groups.” <em>Id., </em>at 642. The court found White, who was an original incorporator of the nonprofit corporation, provided one-half or more of the essential assets for initial corporate performance, was appointed by Board resolution, acted as corporate liaison with outside entities, and carried multiple supervisory responsibilities, had a very special relationship with the nonprofit corporation which fell within the parameters of the “or otherwise” provision. Accordingly, the court found White had standing to challenge corporate actions. <em>Id., </em>at 640, 642.</p>

The court additionally noted the subscribers’ rights, duties, and status could be affected by the nonprofit’s accumulation of excess profits. <em>Id., </em>at 413. Accordingly, the court concluded, because the incorporation documents gave subscribers powers ordinarily afforded to directors, other body members, or members, subscribers fell within § 5793(a), and thus had standing to sue under the Nonprofit Law. <em>Id.</em>

Appellants assert Blue Cross <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>operates solely for the subscribers’ benefit; therefore, all subscribers must possess a “special interest” in the corporation’s actions sufficient to obtain standing under § 5793(a). However, § 5793(a)’s plain language affords standing only to those in influential positions. Appellants hold no such status, and indeed have no more special interest in corporate decisions than the average buyer does in getting a good bargain.

The <em>Petty </em>court stated: <em>“White </em>then does not stand for the proposition ... that any ‘special relationship’ with a non-profit grants a party the right to challenge the non-profit’s actions, but only that a special relationship making that party equivalent to an officer, director, or member, ... confers standing under Section 5793(a).... ” <em>Petty, </em>at 447. The court further clarified this statement in the next sentence, stating: “While the overall purpose of ... Blue Cross’s enabling legislation and Articles of Incorporation is to operate a plan where health benefits are conferred to subscribers, this does not place the subscribers <em>in the same class </em>as members, directors, other bodies or officers of the corporation.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Considering the language in full context, we find no issue with the court’s interchange of the terms “equivalent” and “in the same class.” Effectually, the Commonwealth Court applied the principles of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and correctly determined the interpretation of the general expression “or otherwise” was restricted to encompass only those entitles similar in nature to the specifically enumerated titles found in § 5793(a). <em>Id.</em>

We are convinced the legislature sought to give standing only to those select individuals vested with power and influence over the company, or, as other courts have articulated, to those possessing a “special relationship” with the corporation. Nothing in the enabling legislation, articles of incorporation, or corporate by-laws suggests subscribers or policyholders possess rights or status similar to “a member, officer or member of another body,” or to any other individual in the same class as those enumerated persons. As a result, appellants fail to establish they fall within the “or otherwise” language of § 5793(a), and we find they lack standing as subscribers or policyholders to challenge Blue Cross’s corporate actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It argues <em>Liss </em>is distinguishable from the current case, as both parties in <em>Liss </em>intended for the statute incorporated into the contract to control the terms, and the case did not hold a plaintiff can selectively incorporate certain portions of the statute into the contract.</p>
