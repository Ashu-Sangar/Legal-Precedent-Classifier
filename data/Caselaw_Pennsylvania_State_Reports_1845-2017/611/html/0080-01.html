On August 14, 2003, the Superior Court advised him that the appeal had been dismissed in August 2002 because his attorney neglected to file a docketing statement. Within sixty days of receiving that notice, Watts filed a <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition seeking reinstatement of his appellate rights <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>New counsel was appointed and filed a “no merit” letter on May 25, 2004, averring that the petition was untimely and that no filing exceptions were applicable.

Unlike the first Superior Court panel, which held that Watts should have inquired about the status of his direct appeal much earlier, the second panel found that Watts exercised due diligence at all times. In doing so, the second panel emphasized that Watts is illiterate, that he was completely abandoned by counsel on direct appeal, that he initiated efforts to ascertain the status of the appeal in 2002, and that he filed his first PCRA petition within sixty days of the date on which he discovered that the appeal had been dismissed. Given these facts, the second panel concluded that this case bore many similarities to <em>Bennett, </em>and, therefore, it would be unjust to deny relief to an individual whose first PCRA petition was denied based on the faulty premise that appellate rights can never be restored after the one-year filing deadline has expired. Accordingly, the second panel declared Watts’s second petition timely under section 9545(b)(l)(ii) because it was filed less then sixty days after <em>Bennett </em>was published.</p>

      <em>See </em>Commonwealth brief at 10.

Since this Court modified that rule in <em>Bennett, </em>he argues that <em>Bennett </em>qualifies as a previously-unknown “fact” under section 9545(b)(1)(h). To hold otherwise, Watts contends, would unfairly deprive him of his constitutional right to file a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence. In leveling this argument, Watts maintains that he made every effort to obtain relief through his first PCRA petition, but, as an illiterate prisoner with limited access to legal research materials, he could not have foreseen our ruling in <em>Bennett, </em>which announced a significant departure from prior decisional law applying the PCRA time-bar.</p>

The petition was dismissed for lack of merit, and the defendant filed a timely <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal.

The PCRA court granted relief, but the Superior Court subsequently quashed the appeal, reasoning that the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction to restore the defendant’s appellate rights because the petition was untimely.

The PCRA court denied relief, and we affirmed. Hackett then filed a second PCRA petition, on August 15, 2002, alleging that his execution would violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition .against cruel and unusual punishment. On May 3, 2004, Hackett filed a supplemental petition arguing that he was entitled to a new trial under <em>Batson </em>because Spence had recently secured a new trial based on evidence that Jack McMahon employed discriminatory tactics during jury selection. Unlike Hackett, whose <em>Batsonrelated </em>ineffectiveness claim was rejected due to an insufficient evidentiary record, Spence prevailed on his <em>Batson </em>claim because it was premised on a videotaped lecture released by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office in April 1997 that <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>showed McMahon advocating racial and gender-based discrimination in the selection of jurors.</p>

The Commonwealth appealed, and we granted review. The Commonwealth argued that Hackett’s petition was untimely because his <em>Batson </em>claim was predicated on the discovery of the McMahon videotape and not, as the PCRA court found, on the March 22, 2004 ruling that awarded Spence a new trial. As the videotape was made public in 1997 and Hackett’s supplemental petition was not filed until 2004, the Commonwealth maintained that Hackett failed to exercise due diligence in ascertaining the facts upon which his claim was based.</p>

There was nothing preventing [Hackett] from raising his <em>Batson </em>claim within sixty days thereafter. [Hackett]’s attempt to circumvent the statutory language by asserting that the factual predicate of his claim is actually the PCRA court’s ruling in <em>Spence </em>is specious. A PCRA petitioner cannot avoid the one-year time bar by tailoring the factual predicate of the claim pled in his PCRA petition in a way that unmistakably misrepresents the actual nature of the claim raised. Here, [Hackett]’s <em>Batson </em>claim is not dependent upon what occurred in the PCRA matter of his codefendant and could have independently been raised by [Hackett] in a timely manner.

Watts’s claim is premised upon the dismissal of his direct appeal, which was brought to his attention on August 14, 2003, more than two weeks before the deadline expired. Notwithstanding his illiteracy, Watts had ample time to file another timely PCRA petition seeking restoration of his direct appeal rights, yet he inexplicably failed to do so. Instead, he filed an untimely petition that was rejected by the Superior Court in 2005 under the prevailing view that Pennsylvania courts could not reinstate a petitioner’s appellate rights beyond the one-year filing period, Unlike the defendant in <em>Bennett, </em>however, Watts did not petition this Court for further review, thereby foreclosing any possibility of having his direct appeal rights restored. The Superior Court’s 2005 ruling is final, and Watts cannot resurrect the issue simply by alluding to <em>Bennett. </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3) (to be eligible for PCRA relief, the petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived); 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(3) (an issue has been previously litigated if it was raised and decided in a proceeding collaterally attacking the conviction or sentence).

However, there is nothing in <em>Bennett </em>or section 9545(b)(1)(h) to support that conclusion. The <em>Bennett </em>Court emphasized that any petitioner requesting a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal based on an abandonment theory had to show due diligence and establish that the petition was filed <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>in accordance with subsection (b)(2). We did not authorize courts to grant post-conviction relief in every instance where a petitioner has been abandoned by appellate counsel, and we neither stated nor implied that petitioners could circumvent the statutory filing deadline by citing <em>Bennett </em>as an independent basis for a new claim of ineffectiveness. The latter proposition is absurd because section 9545(b)(1)(h) applies only if the petitioner has uncovered facts that could not have been ascertained through due diligence, and judicial determinations are not facts.</p>

Law is conceived; fact is actual. Law is a rule of duty; fact is that which has been according to or in contravention of the rule.” Black’s Law Dictionary 592 (6th ed.1991). Put another way, “A ‘fact,’ as distinguished from the ‘law,’ ... [is that which] is to be presumed or proved to be or not to be for the purpose of applying or refusing to apply a rule of law.” <em><a href="/pa/598/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="956 A.2d 978" data-case-ids="3991409,8209510" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0350-01,/a2d/956/0978-01">Id.</a> </em>Consistent with these definitions, an in-court ruling or published judicial opinion is law, for it is simply the embodiment of abstract principles applied to actual events. The events that prompted the analysis, which must be established by presumption or evidence, are regarded as fact. Thus, viewed in the appropriate manner, our publication of <em>Bennett </em>did not trigger section 9545(b)(1)(h) because it was not an event that spawned a new claim. As noted above, the issue herein pertains to the dismissal of Watts’s direct appeal, which was addressed on the merits in a separate collateral proceeding that ended in 2005.
