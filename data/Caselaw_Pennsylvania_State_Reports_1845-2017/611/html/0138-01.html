Appellees each filed individual appeals to the DPW Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. After full administrative hearings before separate ALJs, the Bureau sustained Appellees’ appeals and granted the adoption assistance subsidies, based largely upon the <em>Adoption ARC </em>decision. To that end, the ALJs each determined that the children, as African-Americans, were qualified under 55 Pa.Code § 3140.202(b)(4)(iii), and thus were eligible to receive subsidies. Specifically, the subsidies included nonrecurring adoption costs, Medical Assistance coverage from the respective dates of adoption until the children turn eighteen, and monthly cash benefits retroactively from the dates of the children’s adoptions and prospectively until the children reach the age of eighteen.</p>

To further this goal, the General Assembly charged DPW with promulgating regulations to identify at risk children, find them proper adoptive homes, and implement adoption assistance subsidies in furtherance of these goals. Moreover, DPW was to adopt regulations to govern the actions of local and county authorities <em>vis-á-vis </em>adoption subsidies. 62 P.S. § 773(a), (b).

Prior to 1999, it was the understanding of the various county and state agencies involved in adoption subsidies that only children in the custody of a county agency were eligible for such subsidies. This changed in 1999 with the aforementioned <em>Adoption ARC </em>decision. At issue in <em>Adoption ARC </em>was whether a county agency was still responsible for making “reasonable efforts to find an adoptive home -without providing adoption assistance,” 55 Pa.Code § 3140.202(c), for children who were being placed through a private adoption agency. . Philadelphia DHS, the county agency involved in the <em>Adoption ARC </em>case, as well as DPW, argued that it did not have the responsibility to expend such “reasonable efforts” because the child subject to the appeal was not in custody of DHS at the time of adoption, and, thus was ineligible for subsidies.</p>

On appeal, the Commonwealth Court found the failure of CYF to inform the parents of the child’s eligibility for assistance at the time of finalization of the adoption, coupled with the denial of assistance due to the parents’ household income, constituted extenuating circumstances, entitling the parents to a fair hearing on their request for subsidies.</p>

Pursuant to the AOA and administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, adopted children with certain enumerated “special needs,” as defined by 55 Pa.Code § 3140.202(b)(4), are generally eligible to receive an adoption assistance subsidy. The children at issue here all are "special needs” children in accord with the Pennsylvania Code in that they are "member[s] of a minority group.” 55 Pa.Code § 3140.202(b)(4)(iii). Other considerations include having physical, mental, or emotional handicaps, being born with high-risk genetic conditions, being members of a sibling group, or being older than five-years old. <em><a href="/pa/567/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="786 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="404538,9454282" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0141-01,/a2d/786/0176-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 3140.202(b)(4)(i)-(ii), (iv)-(v).</p>

In <em>C.B., </em>DPW raised a challenge to the award of adoption subsidies to a child who had been privately adopted. Specifically at issue was a provision of the Pennsylvania AOA, which mandates that a child be in the custody of the state or a state-approved agency at the time of adoption to be eligible for subsidies; the federal act contains no parallel provision. This Court found no preemption in large part because, while the federal act did not mandate state agency supported adoptions, "it [was] apparent that Congress contemplated agency custody as a proper measure of eligibility for adoption assistance,” and further that "Congress expressly allowed the states participating in the federal program leeway to determine themselves, within certain broad parameters, which children ... are ... eligible for adoption assistance subsidies. ...” <em><a href="/pa/567/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="786 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="404538,9454282" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0141-01,/a2d/786/0176-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/567/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="786 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="404538,9454282" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0141-01,/a2d/786/0176-01">at 183</a>.</p>

While subsection (d) makes an exception to the "reasonable efforts” rule if the best interests of the child so dictate, <em>i.e. </em>in a circumstance where an adoptive family has álready been found, <em>see </em>55 Pa.Code § 3140.202(d), <em>supra </em>p. 1019 (providing it unnecessary to seek an unsubsidized family in cases where a child has developed "significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents” prior to finalization of adoption), such does not alter a county agency's general responsibility to seek out, in the first instance, families not requiring subsidies. We further recognize that in situations where private agencies such as ARC are involved, prospective adoptive parents may well have been located either prior to, or immediately following the child's birth. Indeed, and by way of example, J.J.J. was placed with the Johnsons eight days after his birth, although the adoption was not finalized until six months later. Similar arrangements occurred with Alyssa and Addison Laird. Although not determinative of this appeal, and we offer no substantive or decisional comment on the matter, we note that the subsection (d) exception could be satisfied in such circumstances.</p>
