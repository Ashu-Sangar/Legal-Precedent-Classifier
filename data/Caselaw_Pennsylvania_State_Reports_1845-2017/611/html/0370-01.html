    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[276,603,1150,953]]]'>The General Assembly adopted Act 117 in October 2008 to regulate, in relevant part, providers of debt settlement services (“DSS”). A DSS provider negotiates with creditors on behalf of a consumer “for the purpose of the creditor forgiving part or all of the principal of the debt incurred or credit extended to that consumer.” 63 P.S. § 2402. Pursuant to Section 3(b) of Act 117, DSS providers are prohibited from operating in Pennsylvania without a license from the Banking Department, and are required to comply with the Department’s regulations. 63 P.S. § 2403(b). Licensed DSS providers may not charge a consumer “any fees other than those described in [Section 15 of Act 117] or by regulation promulgated by the [Department.” 63 P.S. § 2415(h). The Department has not yet adopted any fee regulations. Other sections of Act 117 list licensing fees, describe the initial licensing, license renewal, revocation, and reinstatement processes, and create penalties for violations of the statute. <em>See generally </em>63 P.S. §§ 2401-2421, 2448-2449.</p>

The Department denied the allegations, and filed an Application for Summary Relief, claiming that the contentions in the complaint were insufficient as a matter of law to state a claim. Following a <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>hearing, the Commonwealth Court denied the Department’s application in an unpublished opinion.</p>

According to the court, the following parts of Act 117 violate the Non-Delegation Clause and, therefore, are unconstitutional and unenforceable: (1) that portion of Section 3(b) which permits the Department to promulgate regulations affecting DSS providers, and (2) Section 15(h), in its entirety, which authorizes the Department to regulate fees that a DSS provider may charge consumers. The Court stated that there was no basis at that time on which to grant USOBA summary relief on claims regarding that part of Section 3(b) which addresses the Department’s power to license DSS providers or regarding any other challenged provision of Act 117. The court rejected USOBA’s argument that the unconstitutional provisions were inseverable and that, as a result, Act 117 was unenforceable in its entirety.</p>

The Department acknowledges that, because the decision below “does not resolve all the issues in the case,” it would generally be considered an interlocutory order, but claims that in a declaratory judgment action appealability is determined on different grounds. According to the Department, the pivotal question in determining the appealability of an order in a declaratory judgment action is whether the decision constitutes the final determination of the parties’ rights, status, or legal relations. The Department asserts that the Commonwealth Court’s order is a final determination because it “permanently and unalterably changes the status and the rights of the Department to implement [Sections 3(b) and 15(h) of Act 117]” and cannot be reversed through further proceedings in the lower court. The Declaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”), the Department concludes, was devised to ensure the continued operation of government by permitting the Commonwealth to challenge the validity of a decision, like the one now before the Court, without waiting for the remainder of the case to be fully litigated.

The lower court granted only partial relief, and additional claims remain pending below, which could afford USOBA full relief. Until the Commonwealth Court decides those claims, the appeal is <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>interlocutory, regardless of whether this is a declaratory judgment action.

Subdivision (c) states that a trial court may enter a final order as to fewer than all the claims for relief presented or parties involved, upon the express determination of the trial court that an immediate appeal would facilitate resolution of the entire ease. “In the absence of such a determination and entry of a final order, any order or other form of decision that adjudicates fewer than all the claims and parties shall not constitute a final order.” Pa.R.A.P. 341(c).

More than a year later, the trial court vacated its original order based on a development in the caselaw, and reinstated the cause of action against the dismissed defendants, including appellant. On appeal to this Court, the appellant argued that the trial court’s initial order was final and could only have been modified or appealed within thirty days after its entry. According to the appellant, the trial court’s order declared the rights, status, and other legal relations of the parties, and was therefore defined by the DJA as a final order, appealable pursuant to Rule 341(b)(2). <em><a href="/a2d/763/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="763 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="11173759,1366977" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0813-01,/pa/563/0595-01">Id.</a> </em>at 817 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532, Pa.R.A.P. 341(a), (b)(2)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The appellees responded that the trial court’s order sustaining preliminary objections was interlocutory because it did not dispose of all claims and all parties.

      <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>In the lower court, USOBA requested relief in the form of a declaration that Act 117 in its entirety, as applied to DSS providers, is unconstitutional.

The lower court did not address several of USOBA’s arguments and did not ultimately decide whether USOBA was entitled to the full relief originally requested, which remains available via USOBA’s alternate arguments. Essentially, the lower court simply narrowed the scope of USOBA’s declaratory judgment action, without ultimately deciding the case. Under the rule announced in <em>Pennsylvania Bankers, </em>the Commonwealth Court’s order is interlocutory and not appeal-able.

But, the Department fails to account for the actual basis of our prior decision or to identify any tension in applying <em>Pennsylvania Bankers </em>here. The prevailing considerations in <em>Pennsylvania Bankers </em>were the effect of the lower court’s decision on the scope of the litigation and the practical effect on the ultimate decision in the case.

In other words, in <em>Pennsylvania Bankers, </em>the banks challenged the constitutionality of a single provision and, if the lower court had decided the constitutional issue and “granted or denied” relief, the order would have decided rather than merely narrowed the dispute between the parties. Here, however, the constitutionality of multiple provisions remains in dispute and, even though the Commonwealth Court granted USOBA relief as to two provisions, the dispute has not been resolved but merely narrowed.

Rule 341 draws no distinction to separate appealable from non-appealable orders on the basis of party type, whether the party is challenging or defending a statute, or nature of the party, <em>ie., </em>Commonwealth party versus private individual; rather, the nature of the lower court’s order as final or interlocutory is the pivotal factor. <em>Compare </em>Pa.R.A.P. 341 <em>with, e.g., </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1734, 1736 (Commonwealth parties are subject to different security requirements to obtain stay pending appeal, than other parties in civil litigation). Furthermore, the Department provides no support for the assertion (nor can we find any evidence of legislative intent) that the General Assembly created an exception to the general rules of appealability for Commonwealth parties seeking to overturn a lower court decision striking a statute as unconstitutional. For these reasons, we will not devise an <em>ad hoc </em>procedure to vindicate the interest advocated by the Department. The Department has failed to persuade us that a straightforward application of our decision in <em>Pennsylvania Bankers </em>is inappropriate here. Pursuant to precedent, the Department’s present appeal is quashed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[276,495,1152,850]]]'>The sole argument in support of jurisdiction over the cross-appeal appears in USOBA’s jurisdictional statement. USOBA states only that it “filed its cross-appeal in case this Court determines that it does have jurisdiction to hear the [Department’s] appeal.” USOBA’s Jurisdictional Statement, at 1. USOBA’s position on that predicate point is that, in fact, there is no jurisdiction over the Department’s appeal. In response to USOBA’s initial filing, the Department rejected USOBA’s jurisdictional predicate as insufficient, and sought to distinguish the procedural posture of the cross-appeal from that of its own appeal. Asserting an argument akin to a claim that USOBA is not aggrieved by the lower court decision, the Department claimed that the Commonwealth Court’s order was final for the purposes of Sections 3(b) and 15(h) and its own appeal, but interlocutory regarding the remainder of Act 117 and USOBA’s cross-appeal.</p>

We reiterate that the Commonwealth Court’s order granted only part of the relief requested and merely narrowed the dispute between the parties. The only argument raised by USOBA in support of finding that jurisdiction over the cross-appeal exists is not persuasive in light of the reasoning supporting our disposition of the Department’s appeal. Accordingly, USOBA’s cross-appeal is also quashed.</p>

In framing its argument in this case, USOBA also relies on the responsive opinion of Mr. Justice Saylor in <em>Wickett. </em>Justice Saylor dissented in <em>Wickett </em>on the ground that the statutory scheme of the DJA did not support the majority's conclusion that the finality language of Section 7532 was intended by the General Assembly to modify the usual rules of appealability. <a href="/a2d/763/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="763 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="11173759,1366977" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0813-01,/pa/563/0595-01">763 A.2d at 819</a> (Saylor, J., dissenting). In a <em>Pennsylvania Bankers </em>concurrence, Justice Saylor renewed his criticism of <em>Wickett, </em>stating that "it would be preferable: to concede that this Court has had great difficulty with <em>Wickett </em>in the years since its issuance; to recognize that <em>Wickett’s </em>rationale is irreconcilable with a scheme of appealability implementing considered limits designed to control piecemeal litigation; and therefore, to limit <em>Wickett </em>to its facts.” <em>Pennsylvania Bankers, </em><a href="/pa/597/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="948 A.2d 790" data-case-ids="3924949,8245859" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0001-01,/a2d/948/0790-01">948 A.2d at 801</a> (Saylor, J., concurring). Although the <em>Pennsylvania Bankers </em>majority did not go so far as the concurrence to limit the <em>Wickett </em>decision to its facts, the majority certainly limited <em>Wickett </em>in the context which is directly relevant here. Notably, the parties here do not request that we either further limit or overrule the decision in <em>Wickett.</em>
