In early 2006, Appellant; then 35-years-of-age, was residing in a residential neighborhood in Haverford Township, Delaware County, where he had lived his entire life. Appellant was <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>taking college classes at this time and working part time for a security firm. N.T. Trial, 9/26/2007, at 108, 128. On the morning of February 28, 2006, a cold and overcast day, two boys — ages 13 and 12 — who lived on an adjoining street to the one on which Appellant’s house was located, were walking from their homes, via the nearby thoroughfare of Manoa Road, to the middle school they attended. Both testified that, as they walked along this street, Appellant drove up beside them and offered them both a ride to school or to the local “WAWA” grocery store. N.T. Trial, 9/27/07, at 16, 37-39. This grocery store, the Haverford Township police station, public library, and middle school all were located nearby within a short distance of each other along Darby Road which intersects with Manoa Road. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 115-117.

Appellant testified that between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. that morning, he left home in his truck with the intention of getting coffee and breakfast at the WAWA grocery store before beginning a research project for his college public speaking class at the library. <em>Id. </em>at 108-109, 115. As Appellant approached the heavily congested intersection of Naylor’s Run Road and Manoa Road, he recalled observing the two boys standing near the intersection, and, according to Appellant, because of their age and the fact they were carrying backpacks, he believed they were from his neighborhood and on their way to school. Appellant related that, because it had been raining, he offered them a ride to school, or, alternatively, at least as far as the grocery store at which he intended to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 112-113. In Appellant’s view, since he was going in the direction of the school anyway, he thought he was merely doing a “kind thing” by making the <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>offer, and, since they all lived in the same neighborhood, he did not believe the boys’ parents would have objected. <em>Id. </em>at 127.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Later that same morning, after determining Appellant’s address from the license plate information, a Haverford Township police officer, Thomas Long, drove to Appellant’s house, and spoke with Appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 52. According to Officer Long, Appellant did not appear to have any knowledge of why the officer was questioning him. <em>Id. </em>at 60.

Appellant agreed to memorialize this statement in writing, and he handwrote the following: “Two boys walking to school, and I asked if wanted [sic] a ride part of the way, Wawa. Boys said no. I said okay, and left.” <em>Id. </em>at 70. <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>Officer Goodman testified that Appellant looked surprised whenever the officer informed him that he had potentially violated a statute by his actions. <em>Id. </em>at 81. After driving him back to his home, the police asked Appellant if they could search his truck, and he consented. The search yielded nothing of a criminal or suspicious nature. N.T. at 77, 82.</p>

After receiving a telephone call informing him of the charges, Appellant turned himself in. He proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable Ann A. Osborne on September 26, 2007. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Osborne acquitted Appellant of the offenses of stalking and harassment. With respect to the offenses of attempted luring of a child into a motor vehicle, Judge Osborne expressly stated she found no evidence that Appellant had any intent to harm the children, and that she believed “the circumstances show no reason to believe that this defendant had any evil or improper intent in doing what he did.” N.T. Trial, 10/2/07, at 4-5. However, on the sole basis of Appellant’s offer of the rides, she convicted him on all four counts of attempted luring. The trial court found that “[Appellant’s] offer of a ride to the victims is sufficient to constitute an attempt to ‘lure.’ ” Trial Court Opinion, 6/26/08, at 6. The trial court subsequently sentenced Appellant to 18 months’ probation. As an automatic result of his convictions, Appellant is now statutorily mandated to register for ten years as a sex offender under Megan’s Law, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9795.1(a)(1).</p>

Appellant also argued that he had no ill intent in offering the children a ride, but, rather, was merely acting as a “disabled Good Samaritan.” <em>Id.</em>

Appellant suggests that this type of situation can occur in any neighborhood where an adult offers a child who lives there a ride to avoid inclement weather, believing that parental consent to do so would be implied from the fact the adult knows the child from seeing the child in the yard or at a bus stop and, also knows the child’s parents from similar interactions.

The Commonwealth acknowledges that Section 2910 is a penal statute and, hence, must be strictly construed; however, the Commonwealth notes that we are not required to give the words of this statute their narrowest meaning, nor disregard what is the evident legislative intent of the statute. The Commonwealth proffers that when the plain meaning of the words of Section 2910 are considered they do not require any proof of an individual’s intent to harm in order for the individual to be convicted. Rather, in the Commonwealth’s view, all that the statute requires is that the Commonwealth prove a defendant: “(1) lured or attempted to lure a child; (2) into a vehicle or structure; (3) without the express or implied permission of the child’s parent or guardian; and (4) the circumstances did not reasonably indicate that the child was in need of assistance.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 11.

In neither case, according to the Commonwealth, did the Superior Court interpret this section to require an intent to harm the child. Instead, the Commonwealth argues that the statute was read to require “only that a defendant intend to lure a child, not harm the child once lured.” <em>Id. </em>at 14. Thus, the Commonwealth advances the contention that, in the absence of an emergency or parental consent, “an invitation into a vehicle with the intent that the child actually enters [sic] the vehicle suffices to meet the prohibitions of the statute.” <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth maintains that the legislature, in drafting Section 2910, expressly declined to include an “intent to harm” element in the statute. Thus, it claims that this omission, as well as the legislature’s specific recognition of a defense to luring a child into a structure under Section 2910(b) based on the action having been undertaken for a lawful purpose, and its corresponding failure to extend that same defense to luring a child into a motor vehicle under Section 2910(a), demonstrates that criminalization of any act of luring children into motor vehicles without parental consent or an emergency is exactly what the legislature intended. Hence, the Commonwealth contends that adding an intent to harm element to the crime statute would be contrary to the express intentions of the legislature.</p>

Further, “lure suggests an irresistible force, as desire, greed, curiosity, etc. in attracting someone, especially] to something harmful or evil.” <em>Webster’s New World Dictionary, </em>806 (3d.

Necessarily, then, we determine that a “lure” involves the making of a promise of pleasure or gain, the furnishing of a temptation or enticement, or the performance of some other affirmative act calculated to strongly induce another individual <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>to take a particular action, usually and most often likely to result in his or her harm.</p>

Such acts simply do not involve the additional and extra element of powerful persuasion designed to influence the person to take action, which is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a lure. <em>See Adamo, </em><a href="/a2d/637/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="637 A.2d 302" data-case-ids="7354008,937954" data-case-paths="/a2d/637/0302-01,/pa-super/431/0529-01">637 A.2d at 307</a> (holding that a simple offer of a ride by a friend or neighbor does not constitute a “lure” as that term is usually defined, as the offer is not accompanied by an inducement such as a “promise of pleasure,” “an enticement,” or prospect of “financial gain”).</p>

Consistent with the plain and unambiguous meaning of the term “lure,” we therefore hold that an attempt to lure under Section 2910 does not occur upon the mere offer of a ride in a motor vehicle to a child, but, rather, involves only situations where a child is provided a further enticement or inducement to enter the vehicle, in addition to the offer of the ride, particularly under such circumstances which suggest the child is being led into a potentially harmful situation. As the Superior Court recognized in <em>Adamo, </em>this enticement or inducement may be the promise of a pleasurable reward for entry into the vehicle such as receiving money or a treat such as candy or ice cream. Likewise, a similar attractive temptation could be created with the promise of the opportunity for <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>the child to view an object of interest like a toy, a game, or a puppy.

    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[176,602,1153,1173]]]'>Conversely, as the Superior Court also has recognized, an enticement or inducement may take the form of a directive or a command to a child to enter a car, which suggests deleterious consequences to the child if he or she does not obey. In <em>Commonwealth v.

The court affirmed the defendant’s conviction and adopted the trial court’s reasoning that the command contained an implied promise that the child would avoid an unpleasant consequence if she complied. Thus, both courts viewed the prospect of relief from a prospective adverse outcome to be a sufficient inducement for the child to go along with the command, and, hence, brought it within the ambit of an attempted lure. Such an interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning of the term “lure,” because a brazen order to a child to enter a vehicle made by a stranger creates a strong fear-based incentive for the child to follow that particular course of action, as he or she subjectively may believe that is the only way to avoid harm. For that reason, such conduct is also proscribed by Section 2910.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Likewise, any parent or neighbor who makes a similar spontaneous offer of a ride to school to their children’s friends or acquaintances may, again, be subject to prosecution, in the absence of express or implied parental consent, solely because of their offer of the ride.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The plain language of Section 2910 does not support a conclusion that the legislature intended such a result. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1) (legislature does not intend a result that is unreasonable or absurd); <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>

Likewise, he did not direct or command them to enter his vehicle, nor did he threaten them with harm if they failed to accept his offers of a ride. Consequently, under these circumstances, where the evidence of record showed only that Appellant twice offered a ride to two children, and did not additionally provide any temptation or enticement for the boys to enter his vehicle, the mere act of offering the ride, standing alone, did not fall within the common, ordinary, and accepted meaning of a “lure.” The evidence, therefore, is insufficient as a matter of law to support Appellant’s conviction for attempted luring.

The defendant was convicted of luring under the version of Section 2910 in effect at the time, <em>see supra </em>at n. 5. On appeal, he did not raise the issue of whether his conduct of commanding the child to enter the car constituted luring within the meaning of Section 2910. Instead, he contended that since the child did not get into the car he was not guilty of violating Section 2910 because the statute as it then existed did not include the offense of attempting to lure a child into a motor vehicle. Our Court agreed that the defendant did not lure the child into the car and, at <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>most, unsuccessfully tried to do so which was conduct punishable by 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 901 — criminal attempt — an offense for which he was not charged.

The Concurring and Dissenting Opinion contends that the failure of the legislature to provide a similar defense for attempting to lure a child into a motor vehicle evidences an intent by the legislature "to impose an absolute prohibition on trying to get a child into a vehicle without parental consent.” Concurring and Dissenting Opinion at 557-58, 28 A.3d at 914. We respectfully disagree that the legislature intended, with this amendment, such a sweeping criminalization of even the mere offer of a ride. The addition of this affirmative defense merely indicates the legislature's heightened concern for situations where the alleged luring involves a structure; however, this addition does not shed light on the proper interpretation of what constitutes a "lure” — a term which is used both in the definition of the offense and in the affirmative defense. Critically, then, even with this amendment, the focus remains on what conduct constitutes a "lure.”</p>

Moreover, the existence of implied consent is an amorphous and highly subjective concept, as this case demonstrates, as Appellant testified he believed that the children’s parents would not have objected to his giving the boys a ride due to the fact that they lived nearby, and he was known to, and had friendly interactions with, many parents and their children in the neighborhood in which they all lived, N.T. Trial, 9/26/07, at 135. Amelioration of an incorrect interpretation of one portion of a penal statute imposing significant punitive consequences cannot depend on the grace of governmental officials in interpreting and applying other provisions of that enactment; rather, it is the sacrosanct obligation of our Court to furnish the correct meaning of the statutory term at issue.</p>
