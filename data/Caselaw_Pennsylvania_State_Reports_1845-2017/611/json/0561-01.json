        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice EAKIN.\nIndian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledge-dale originated in 1955 as the governing body of a development located in Salem Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. The development consists of 546 acres, and its purpose is \u201c \u2018to develop adjacent lakeside land into a miniature community for vacation, recreation and retirement.\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledgedale v. Glatfelter, 950 A.2d 1093, 1095 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (quoting Association\u2019s Official Handbook). The Association developed rules and regulations, which are recorded as protective covenants running with the land. Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Covenants provides all \u201c \u2018building, excavation, exterior remodeling or altering of any structure, wall or fence shall [not] be commenced without obtaining written approval of the Developer ... as to the location, elevation, set back from property lines, construction materials, quality of workm[a]nship and harmony of external design with existing structures.\u2019 \u201d Id.\nIn 1980, John P. Glatfelter and his wife, Regina L. Glatfelter, purchased a lot within the community; John Glatfelter died in 1990, leaving Regina Glatfelter the sole owner. The lot sat vacant until the fall of 2003 when son David Glatfelter began constructing a foundation. The Association initially inspected and approved the excavation, but in December, 2003 informed the Glatfelters the work was substandard and inadequate pursuant to the Covenants. The Glatfelters were ordered to cease construction until a new construction plan was approved.\nIn April, 2004, the Association filed an equity action alleging the Glatfelters violated the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.101 et seq., which the Association incorporated into the Covenants by resolution on April 24, 2004. The Association sought an order directing the Glatfelters to comply with the Covenants and to cease work until approval was obtained from the architectural committee. On April 30, 2004, the Glatfelters agreed to stop work until they submitted a new application for construction in conformance with the Covenants, but they failed to comply with the agreement; trial on the equity action was scheduled for July 26, 2005. At trial, the parties entered a stipulation; the Glatfelters agreed to file an application for construction within 60 days, prepare an outline to comply with the Covenants and Construction Code, and hire an engineer to monitor construction. In exchange, the Association waived all past fees and fines. The trial court approved the stipulation and entered it as an order. The Glatfelters again failed to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the stipulation, and the Association filed a petition for civil contempt.\nBetween the commencement of the equity action in April, 2004 and the July, 2005 trial, Act 92 of 2004 amended the Construction Code to exempt \u201crecreational cabins\u201d from its requirements so long as:\n(i) the cabin is equipped with at least one smoke detector, one fire extinguisher and one carbon monoxide detector in both the kitchen and sleeping quarters; [and]\n(ii) the owner of the cabin files with the municipality either\n(A) an affidavit on a form prescribed by the department attesting to the fact that the cabin meets the definition of a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d in section 103; or\n(B) a valid proof of insurance for the recreational cabin, written and issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, stating that the structure meets the definition of a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d as defined in section 103.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(b)(7). A \u201crecreational cabin\u201d is defined as a structure:\n(1) utilized principally for recreational activity;\n(2) not utilized as a domicile or residence for any individual for any time period;\n(3) not utilized for commercial purposes;\n(4) not greater than two stories in height, excluding basement;\n(5) not utilized by the owner or any other person as a place of employment;\n(6) not a mailing address for bills and correspondence; and\n(7) not listed as an individual\u2019s place of residence on a tax return, driver\u2019s license, car registration or voter registration.\nId., \u00a7 7210.103. Despite adopting the Construction Code the prior year, the Association passed a resolution in April, 2005 refusing to recognize the recreational cabin exemption.\nThe Glatfelters relied upon the recreational cabin exemption when they responded to the Association\u2019s petition for contempt and argued they were exempt from the Construction Code and the Covenants. On December 26, 2005, the Glatfelters submitted a building permit issued by Salem Township for construction of a \u201c \u2018two-story vacation home, slab on grade: stick built (recreational cabin exempt).\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks, at 1097 (quoting Salem Township Permit). Attached to the permit was a \u201cRecreational Cabin Affidavit\u201d in which the Glatfelters stated the proposed structure met the requirements of the Construction Code\u2019s recreational cabin exemption.\nThe trial court heard argument on the Association\u2019s civil contempt petition on April 12, 2006. At that time, the parties stipulated the issue for determination was \u201c \u2018[w]hether or not the provisions of a recreational cabin exclusion [are] applicable in this case and/or whether or not a recreational cabin as defined by the Uniform [Construction] Code creates an exemption which is binding upon the Townships as well as Property Owners Associations.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Stipulation, at \u00b6 23). While the trial court agreed the Glatfelters met the recreational cabin exemption, it held the exemption did not apply because the Glatfelters agreed to comply with the Association\u2019s requirements as they existed at the time of the April 30, 2004 agreement. Regarding contempt, the trial court found the Glatfelters did not willfully violate the court\u2019s order and permitted an additional 90 days to comply. After the Glatfelters failed to do so, the Association filed another contempt petition, which the trial court granted.\nThe Glatfelters timely appealed the contempt order to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, holding the Glatfelters did not waive their ability to raise the recreational cabin exemption by virtue of the April, 2004 and July, 2005 agreements. Id., at 1100. The court noted the Construction Code unambiguously preempts the field of construction regulation. Therefore, since neither of the agreements specifically referred to the \u201crecreational cabin\u201d exemption, the Glatfelters did not waive the ability to invoke the exemption. The Commonwealth Court did not address whether the purported use satisfied the definition of \u201crecreational activity,\u201d as the only issues before it were \u201cwhether the recreational cabin exclusion applies ... and whether the Township and the Association are bound by the exclusion.\u201d Id., at 1100 n. 4.\nThe Association appealed, and we granted allocatur limited to the following issue: \u201c[wjhether the term \u2018recreational activity,\u2019 as contained in the Construction Code, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103, is ambiguous, necessitating that this Court apply the rules of statutory construction to ascertain the intent of the Legislature?\u201d Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledgedale v. Glatfelter, 600 Pa. 98, 963 A.2d 902, 902-03 (2008). We later expanded our scope of review and requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the following issues:\nAre appellees entitled to build a \u201crecreational cabin,\u201d as defined in 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103, in the secondary home planned community of Indian Rocks, which had adopted the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.101 et seq. ?\nAre appellees estopped by the agreement with appellant in July of 2005 from building a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d in the secondary home planned community of Indian Rocks?\nPer Curiam Order, 12/30/10. As our disposition of the third issue will determine whether the other issues need to be addressed, we will discuss it first.\nThe Association argues the Glatfelters are estopped from building a recreational cabin under the doctrines of equitable estoppel, promissory estoppel, and estoppel by judicial admission or stipulation. It notes in the July, 2005 Stipulation, the Glatfelters agreed to submit an application with the Association describing the intended construction, to conform with the Association\u2019s rules and regulations then in effect, and to hire an engineer to monitor construction. The Association contends, based upon these assurances, it agreed to end the proceedings and not seek the fines and penalties it levied against the Glatfelters. The Association also suggests the Glatfelters have impliedly waived the recreational cabin exemption by agreeing to abide by the Association\u2019s rules and regulations, which at the time of the agreement specifically refused to adopt the recreational cabin exemption. Pursuant to these various legal doctrines, the Association concludes it would be unfair for the Glatfelters to circumvent its rules and regulations by claiming a recreational cabin exemption when they agreed to abide by the rules and regulations.\nThe Glatfelters argue the Association\u2019s resolution refusing to recognize the recreational cabin exemption is unenforceable because the Construction Code specifically preempts homeowners\u2019 association rules and regulations. They cite \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)\u00ae of the Construction Code, which provides \u201ca homeowners\u2019 association or community association shall be preempted from imposing building construction standards or building codes for buildings to be constructed, renovated, altered or modified.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)\u00ae. Thus, they contend, they cannot be estopped from building a recreational cabin because the Association\u2019s rules and regulations are in direct contravention of state law.\nResolution of this issue requires us to interpret the breadth of the Construction Code\u2019s preemption clause; specifically, we must determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cbuilding construction standards or building codes.\u201d Because statutory interpretation is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. See In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006) (citation omitted). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921. When interpreting statutes, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1903. If the words of a statute are unambiguous, we are required to interpret the statute in accordance with the plain meaning of the words. Id., \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe Glatfelters suggest because the Construction Code provides for a recreational cabin exemption and the Construction Code preempts homeowners\u2019 associations\u2019 rules and regulations, a homeowners\u2019 association cannot prevent a landowner from building a recreational cabin. Such an interpretation requires a very broad reading of the phrase \u201cbuilding code standards or building codes\u201d found in the preemption clause. The Construction Code does not define \u201cbuilding code standards\u201d or \u201cbuilding codes\u201d; therefore, we look to the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the Construction Code and the ordinary meaning of the relevant phrases.\nThe Construction Code\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprovide standards for the protection of life, health, property and environment and for the safety and welfare of the consumer, general public and the owners and occupants of buildings and structures.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.102(b)(1). With that purpose in mind, we understand \u201cbuilding code standards or building codes\u201d to refer to the materials, manner, and methods of construction\u2014 the nuts and bolts so to speak \u2014 which ensure a structure\u2019s safety. For example, the Construction Code specifies the depth of a stair tread, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 403.21(6)(ii), and whether smoke alarms should be interconnected. Id., \u00a7 403.21(6)(i).\nIndeed, the Construction Code is voluminous and covers nearly every component of a structure. What it does not cover, however, are the more aesthetic features of a building. The Construction Code does not say whether you can have blue shutters on a green exterior or whether you are permitted to install a satellite dish on your roof. Therefore, while a homeowners\u2019 association is preempted from establishing codes related to stair treads, it is not preempted from enforcing more subjective requirements, such as a proposed structure\u2019s harmony with other structures. To hold that the Legislature intended to preempt all homeowners\u2019 associations\u2019 rules and regulations would lead to the absurd result of disbanding all homeowners\u2019 associations in the Commonwealth \u2014 a result we must presume the Legislature did not intend. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (General Assembly does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable).\nTurning to the stipulation entered between the parties, the Glatfelters agreed to abide by the Association\u2019s rules and regulations. Chief among those rules and regulations is Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Covenants, which provides all \u201c \u2018building, excavation, exterior remodeling or altering of any structure, wall or fence shall [not] be commenced without obtaining written approval of the Developer ... as to the location, elevation, set back from property lines, construction materials, quality of workm[a]nship and harmony of external design with existing structures.\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks, at 1095 (quoting Association\u2019s Official Handbook). In other words, the Association has broad discretion in determining what can or cannot be built within its community, and, for better or worse, the Glatfelters agreed to obtain approval from the Association regarding their intended structure. The Glatfelters cannot use the recreational cabin exemption as a trump card to bypass the rules and regulations to which they agreed. As stated above, the Construction Code could preempt the Association\u2019s regulations relating to construction materials and processes, but it does not preempt the Association\u2019s ability to refuse a structure for other reasons, including the harmony with other structures and, to some degree, the quality of workmanship.\nHaving determined the Glatfelters agreed to obtain the approval of the Association regarding the intended structure and that approval has not been granted, we need not address the remaining issues. Accordingly, we reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order reversing the trial court\u2019s finding John P. Glatfelter in contempt.\nOrder reversed.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Chief Justice CASTILLE joins.\nJustice TODD files a concurring opinion.\n. Department of Labor and Industry Form UCC-13.\n. Section 7210.301(d)(1) of the Construction Code similarly states:\nThe regulations adopted by the department implementing these codes shall supersede and preempt all local building codes regulating any aspect of construction, alteration and repair of buildings adopted or enforced by any municipality or authority or pursuant to any deed restriction, rule, regulation, ordinance, resolution, tariff or order of any public utility or any State or local board, agency, commission or homeowners\u2019 association except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this act.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.301(d)(1).\n. To be clear, we are not holding the Glatfelters agreed to abide by the Association's resolution that rejected the recreational cabin exemption. Our holding is premised entirely on the Glatfelters' failure to obtain the Association\u2019s approval regarding the intended structure. Accordingly, we need not address the validity of the Association\u2019s resolution refusing to adopt the recreational cabin exemption.\n. John P. Glatfelter passed away in 1990; therefore, it is unclear why the trial court entered the order against him. However, neither party addressed this issue; therefore, we will not address it either.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nI agree with the lead Justices that there is a difference between infrastructure and aesthetics. See Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (\u201cOAJC\u201d), at 568-70, 28 A.3d at 1265-66. I would merely note, however, that some of the concerns raised by Appellant regarding the construction on Appellees\u2019 property were of the former type. In any event, here, I believe we are confronted with the different question of what constitutes a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d under the Uniform Construction Code.\nIn this regard, I support Mr. Justice Baer\u2019s position that the conception is ambiguous and should be understood to incorporate rational limits. See Concurring Opinion, at 578-83, 28 A.3d at 1271-74 (Baer, J.). Nevertheless, I do not support the hunting-and-fishing nexus which Justice Baer favors, since such language appeared in early bills on the subject, but the Legislature acted to remove it in the political process. In any event, I agree with Appellant (and Justice Baer) that the recreational-cabin conception should not be applied so broadly as to authorize the construction of a substandard structure in a secondary home planned community. On this point, I believe that divorcing the definition of \u201crecreational cabin\u201d from the mainstream concept of a \u201ccabin\u201d \u2014 in terms of both design and location \u2014 leads to unreasonable results. It seems to me that the General Assembly\u2019s objective was merely to avoid unduly burdening citizens erecting rustic cabins in appropriate venues.\nThe separate estoppel question, upon which this case may also turn, is one of lesser public importance. This appears to be evidenced by the minimalistic treatment accorded it in the lead opinion (in which the elements of the doctrine are not set forth or discussed). See OAJC, at 570, 28 A.3d at 1266. On the other hand, the substantial public importance of the question of what constitutes a recreational cabin is particularly great, in light of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s published opinion suggesting a very broad application of the exception. See Indian Rocks Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc. of Ledgedale v. Glatfelter, 950 A.2d 1093, 1099-1100 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008).\nNotably, a determination on appellate review may rest on alternative holdings. See Commonwealth v. Markman, 591 Pa. 249, 282 & n. 15, 916 A.2d 586, 606 & n. 15 (2007). Thus, I respectfully differ -with Madame Justice Todd\u2019s suggestion that we should not reach the main issue of public importance here.\n. See, e.g., Supplemental Brief for Appellant at 8 (\"The Association voiced numerous concerns with this nascent construction, including concerns regarding the 'unconventional and sub-standard building methods used,\u2019 the fact that the poured wall foundation forms had 'blown out' to create an uneven wall structure, and the fact that the foundation walls did not contain proper reinforcement materials and were not thick enough to support a house.\u201d).\n. Compare H.B. 2149, Printer No. 2896, Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Pa. 2003) (reflecting the proposal to define \"recreational cabin\u201d as \"[a] structure which is not occupied on a full-time basis and is used mainly by the occupants for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing\u201d), with 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103(1) (defining \u201crecreational cabin,\u201d inter alia, in terms of principal use for \"recreational activity\u201d).",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\nconcurring.\nInitially, I agree with the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (OAJC) that the preemption provisions of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code (UCC) \u201crefer to the materials, manner, and methods of construction \u2014 the nuts and bolts so to speak \u2014 which ensure a structure\u2019s safety,\u201d and not \u201cthe more aesthetic features of a building.\u201d OAJC at 569, 28 A.3d at 1265.1 further concur with the lead Justices that, to the extent Appellant, the Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, chooses to restrict the outward appearance of the homes and structures built within the planned community, it may do so without running afoul of the supremacy of the UCC. Thus, I agree that the Association may, in its discretion, reject any building plans submitted to it by the Glatfelters or any other prospective homebuilder on the basis that the plans do not comply with the aesthetic requirements of the Association\u2019s Covenants.\nTo the extent, however, that the OAJC infers that the Association rejected the Glatfelter\u2019s proposed structure solely on the basis of aesthetics, see id. at 570, 28 A.3d at 1266 (\u201cThe Construction Code does not preempt the Association\u2019s ability to refuse a structure for other reasons, including the harmony with other structures and, to some degree, the quality of workmanship.\u201d), I note that no evidence of record exists to support any suggestion in this regard. Rather, if anything, the record indicates that the Association ultimately rejected any construction by the Glatfelters merely because \u201cno proper paperwork has been submitted to the [Association].\u201d See Petition for Contempt filed by the Association at \u00b6 12 (Jun. 5, 2007) (found at Reproduced Record (R.R.) 92a). On this point, I tend to agree with the Association that the Glatfelters had failed to submit the \u201cproper paperwork\u201d in order to construct their proposed home.\nWhen the Glatfelters eventually began construction in the fall of 2003, the Association had its own building code, as contained within the Covenants. Under these rules, the original structure failed inspection in December, 2003. On April 24, 2004, the Association incorporated the UCC into the Covenants as the standard for structures built within the planned community. In accord therewith, the Association then filed an action in equity against the Glatfelters in the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas, contending that the proposed home violated both the Covenants and the UCC incorporated therein. This initial suit quickly terminated, as the Association and Glatfelters reached an accord (the April 2004 Settlement), in which the Glatfelters agreed to comply with the UCC and the Covenants.\nOn July 15, 2004, the General Assembly enacted Act 92 of 2004, which significantly amended the UCC. Relevant hereto, Act 92 implemented the recreational cabin exemption, which, as noted by the lead opinion, permits qualifying structures to be excluded from the stringent mandates of the statute. See OAJC at 563-65, 28 A.3d at 1262-63. Despite the broad preemption provisions of the UCC, in April of 2005, the Association passed a resolution, in which it attempted to reject the validity of the recreational cabin exemption in its development.\nIn July of 2005, .the Association again sought court intervention against the Glatfelters, who had still failed to comply with either the Association\u2019s Covenants or the April 2004 Settlement. The parties again reached an accord, on July 26, 2005 (the July 2005 Settlement), whereby the Glatfelters agreed, inter alia, that:\nThe proposed construction must conform with the rules and regulations now in effect at Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc., of Ledgedale.\nThe Glatfelters will engage the services of a professional engineer who will be Greenman-Pedersen, Inc., to monitor the construction, and said engineer will certify to the Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc., of Ledgedale, that the construction meets the Association rules and regulations, including the UCC, before the next phase of construction may begin.\nJuly 2005 Settlement at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\nThe Glatfelters also agreed to submit all necessary paperwork and filing fees to the Association and the local municipality, Salem Township. Id. at \u00b6 1. Subsequently, the Glatfelters submitted to the Association an approved building permit from Salem Township, which authorized the construction of a \u201ctwo-story vacation home, slab on grade: stick built (recreational cabin exempt).\u201d Salem Township Permit, R.R. at 154a (emphasis added). Thereafter, the Association filed for civil contempt against the Glatfelters, alleging that the building permit was insufficient and, thus, they failed to submit the documentation required by the July 2005 Settlement before resuming construction.\nThe trial court eventually found for the Association, concluding that the Glatfelters\u2019 improperly invoked the recreational cabin exemption. The trial court reasoned that, when the Glatfelters entered into the April 2004 Settlement, agreeing to construct the home in accordance with the Association\u2019s Covenants, the recreational cabin exemption had not yet been enacted by the General Assembly as part of the UCC. In other words, the Glatfelters had to abide by the law as it existed in 2004, and, therefore could not invoke the recreational cabin exemption to avoid the April 2004 Settlement.\nAs noted by the OAJC, the Commonwealth Court reversed this ruling, finding for the Glatfelters and reasoning as follows: (1) the July 2005 Settlement controlled; (2) under the preemption provisions of the UCC, the Association could not opt out of the recreational cabin exemption; and (3) as the UCC was part of the Covenants, and the Glatfelters agreed to act in conformity with the Covenants in the July 2005 Settlement, they were free to invoke the recreational cabin exemption and to build their vacation home in accord therewith. Initially, I agree with the Commonwealth Court that the trial court erred in focusing on the April 2004 Settlement, rather than the July 2005 Settlement. \u201cSettlement agreements are governed by contract law principles.\u201d Lesko v. Frankford Hospital-Bucks County, 15 A.3d 337, 341-42 (Pa.2011). One of those well established principles states, \u201c[a] new agreement will supersede the old so far as they cannot be executed together.\u201d Robert Grace Contracting Co. v. Norfolk & W. Ry. Co., 259 Pa. 241, 102 A. 956, 957 (1918). Viewing these two settlements in light of the history of this case, one may only conclude that the parties reached an agreement in April of 2004, the Glatfelters breached that agreement, the Association filed suit, and a new settlement was reached in July of 2005, which took the place of the April 2004 Settlement. Indeed, the July 2005 Settlement specifically stated that the Glatfelters were to abide by the Association\u2019s \u201crules and regulations now in effect.\u201d July 2005 Settlement at \u00b6 2. Further, neither before the Commonwealth Court nor this Court has either party contended that the April 2004 Settlement controls the instant appeal.\nPremised upon the conclusion that the July 2005 Settlement governs this case, I turn to the Association\u2019s contention that under the terms of the settlement: (1) the Glatfelters were required to construct their home in accordance with the Covenants as they existed at that time; and (2) the Covenants prohibited the construction of recreational cabins notwithstanding their authorization under the UCC. Put succinctly, the Association contends that the Glatfelters are equitably estopped from invoking the recreational cabin exemption because they agreed not to do so in the July 2005 Settlement. In response, the Glatfelters argue that because the UCC supersedes all conflicting regulations by homeowners\u2019 associations, see 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)(i), the Association could not except itself out of the recreational cabin exemption. Therefore, contends the Glatfelters, they could construct a recreational cabin and still comply with the July 2005 Settlement.\nWhile a strong argument can be made that the UCC preempts the Association\u2019s resolution regarding the recreational cabin exemption, notwithstanding the Glatfelters\u2019 attempt to inject the issue into this case, it simply is not before this Court. Rather, this case is about a private agreement reached between two parties, which mandated that the Glatfelters\u2019 \u201cproposed construction must conform with the rules and regulations now [July 2005] in effect at Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc., of Ledgedale.\u201d July 2005 Settlement at \u00b6 2. While there is no disagreement that the Glatfelters so promised, the pertinent issue is whether that promise equitably estops them from arguing otherwise at this juncture.\nEquitable estoppel is a doctrine that prevents one from doing an act differently than the manner in which another was induced by word or deed to expect. A doctrine sounding in equity, equitable estoppel recognizes that an informal promise implied by one\u2019s words, deeds or representations which leads another to rely justifiably thereon to his own injury or detriment, may be enforced in equity.\nNovelty Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Siskind, 500 Pa. 432, 457 A.2d 502, 503 (1983).\nIt is reasonable to conclude that the Association settled its lawsuit against the Glatfelters in justifiable reliance upon their agreement to conform to the rules and regulations of the Association in effect in July, 2005, which prohibited the building of a recreational cabin. The Glatfelters expressly acquiesced to this consideration in exchange for the termination of the Association lawsuit. Thus, I conclude that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is applicable, and thereunder the Glatfelters are precluded from constructing an argument to avoid the settlement agreement, and thereby the covenants of the Association, which plainly preludes the construction of a recreational cabin. On this basis alone, I am able to join the conclusion that the Commonwealth Court should be reversed, and judgment should be entered for the Association.\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the Glatfelters were not equitably estopped from asserting the recreational cabin exemption, on the merits, I do not believe the structure they desire to build meets the definition of a recreational cabin. A recreational cabin is defined in Section 7210.103 of the UCC as a structure which is:\n(1) utilized principally for recreational activity;\n(2) not utilized as a domicile or residence for any individual for any time period;\n(3) not utilized for commercial purposes;\n(4) not greater than two stories in height, excluding basement;\n(5) not utilized by the owner or any other person as a place of employment;\n(6) not a mailing address for bills and correspondence; and\n(7) not listed as an individual\u2019s place of residence on a tax return, driver\u2019s license, car registration or voter registration.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103.\nThe parties do not dispute that the Glatfelters\u2019 proposed recreational cabin is a two-story structure of approximately 1,700 square feet, with eight rooms, two bathrooms, and an attached garage. Such facts emphasize the question: if the Glatfelters can build this \u201ccabin\u201d in a planned community in the Poconos, why cannot anyone construct any structure, anywhere, of any size or elaborateness, so long as it is two-stories, used principally for a \u201crecreational activity,\u201d and meets the other rather innocuous requirements of Section 7210.103? In other words, if all that is proposed is a two-story secondary residence (thus satisfying clauses (2) through (7) of Section 7210.103), then all a person need do is certify that the home will be \u201cutilized primarily for recreational activity\u201d to qualify for the exemption.\n\u201cRecreation\u201d can mean any number of things, and is broadly defined as \u201crefreshment of one\u2019s mind or body after work through an amusing or stimulating activity: play.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary at 927 (2001). Similarly, \u201cvacation\u201d is defined as \u201ca period of time for pleasure, rest, or relaxation....\u201d Id. at 1217. Of course, we all recreate or enjoy vacation in different ways: napping, reading a book, online shopping, playing sports, or simply walking.\nIn accord with the specific statutory language, the General Assembly passed the UCC to protect \u201clife, health, property and [the] environment,\u201d and also to ensure the protection of \u201cthe safety and welfare of the consumer, general public and the owners and occupants of buildings and structures.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.102(b)(1). If this Court were to hold that the proposed building was a recreational cabin exempt from the UCC solely because clauses (2) through (7) of Section 7210.103, quoted above, are met and any conceivable \u201crecreational activity\u201d could occur therein, this exception would swallow the rule, and the purpose of the UCC would be vitiated. As already stated, the General Assembly enacted the UCC to standardize uniform benchmarks applicable to the construction of all buildings, with very few exceptions, throughout the Commonwealth. Any interpretation nullifying that goal should be rejected as inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s stated intent. Thus, it falls to this Court to provide a meaningful definition, consonant with the General Assembly\u2019s intent in passing the UCC, for the ambiguous phrase \u201crecreational activity.\u201d\nUpon determining that a statutory provision is ambiguous, this Court is guided by the rules of statutory construction. These well-established rules provide:\n(1) The occasion and necessity of the statute.\n(2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.\n(3) The mischief to be remedied.\n(4) The object to be attained.\n(6) The consequences of a particular interpretation.\n(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). Moreover, we should presume \u201c[t]hat the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat the General Assembly intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1922(1) & (5). Finally, reports and comments available to the General Assembly at the time of final passage may be used to construe the statute. Id. \u00a7 1939.\nIn order to analyze the recreational cabin exemption under these tenets, a general background to the UCC is first necessary. Over staunch opposition, in 1999 the General Assembly adopted the model code of the Building Officials and Code Administrators International as Pennsylvania\u2019s Uniform Construction Code. In enacting the UCC, the legislature found that such a model code was necessary to provide this Commonwealth with uniform and modern construction standards, in order to correct the problem of multiple municipalities within the Commonwealth having \u201cno construction codes to provide for the protection of life, health, property and the environment and for the safety and welfare of the consumer, general public, and the owners and occupants of buildings and structures.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.102(a)(1). In furtherance of these findings, the General Assembly explicitly established that the purposes of the Act were:\n(1) To provide standards for the protection of life, health, property and environment and for the safety and welfare of the consumer, general public and the owners and occupants of buildings and structures.\n(2) To encourage standardization and economy in construction by providing requirements for construction and construction materials consistent with nationally recognized standards, [and]\n(3) To permit to the fullest extent feasible the use of state-of-the-art technical methods, devices and improvements consistent with reasonable requirements for the health, safety and welfare of occupants or users of buildings and structures.\nId. \u00a7 7210.102(b)(l)-(3).\nBetween the date of its passage in 1999 and 2004, all buildings and structures within the Commonwealth, without regard for complexity or simplicity of design, fell under the auspices of the UCC. House Bill 2149 of 2003 was then introduced to attempt to alleviate some of the strictness of the UCC, including abolishing many of the requirements it imposed upon persons making small repairs to homes. Importantly to the discussion at hand, the bill also included what has now become known as the recreational cabin exemption. However, in HB 2149, a recreational cabin was defined as, inter alia, \u201ca structure used principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing.\u201d HB 2149, however, while passed by the House, was never acted upon in the Senate.\nTwo months after HB 2149 \u201cdied,\u201d Senate Bill 1139 of 2004 was introduced, also for the purpose (among other things) of adding a recreational cabin exemption to the UCC. Relevant to this appeal, however, one major difference existed: the definition of a recreational cabin changed from that \u201cused principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing\u201d to \u201cutilized principally for recreational activities.\u201d The Senate journal contains no reasoning regarding the definitional change.\nIt appears, however, that the \u201cseasonal hunting and fishing\u201d concept survived. In the Bill Summary for SB 1139, prepared on July 2, 2004 (the day after the House of Representatives passed an amended version of SB 1139, but prior to the Senate\u2019s final passage of the bill), recreational cabins were defined consistent with the HB 2149 definition: \u201cused principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing.\u201d Further, the Bill Summary stated that the exemption was necessary because enforcement of the UCC in the backwoods of rural counties is almost impossible, and the \u201csportsmen who utilize hunting/fishing cabins are not concerned about the standardization/quality of construction and, in fact, are responsible citizens that accept rustic conditions.\u201d House of Representatives Bill Summary, SB 1139, at 3 (Jul. 2, 2004) (Bill Summary). The legislature passed SB 1139 on July 4, 2004, and it became Act 92 of 2004. With this background, it should follow that the General Assembly intended the term \u201crecreational activity\u201d in Act 92 to encompass seasonal hunting, fishing, and like activities.\nMoreover, the common use definition of a cabin is a structure which is \u201csmall [and] roughly constructed.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary at 153 (2001). While that definition seemingly contradicts the above-stated, generalized goals of the UCC, it is completely consistent with the foregoing discussion: the General Assembly specifically intended to exempt, statewide, from the strict and rigid mandates of the UCC \u201csmall, roughly constructed\u201d buildings; in other words, structures intended for \u201csportsmen who are ... not concerned about standardization/quality of construction and, in fact, are responsible citizens that accept rustic conditions.\u201d Bill Summary at 3. To accept, on the other hand, that the General Assembly chose to exclude structures like the one proposed by the Glatfelters \u2014 1,700 square feet, eight rooms, an attached garage, and situated on a lake \u2014 from the UCC would lead, as stated, to an unreasonable, and absurd result, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1), and would disfavor the public interest of safety and welfare against any private interest. Id. \u00a7 1922(5).\nThus, I would hold that the Glatfelters, through the July 2005 Settlement, are equitably estopped from now invoking the recreational cabin exemption in order to construct their proposed home outside the mandates of the Covenants or the UCC. Moreover, even if recreational cabin exemption would apply instantly, consistent with the statutory interpretation analysis above, in my view, the Glatfelters have not proposed to construct a recreational cabin. As I agree with the OAJC that the contempt citation should be reinstated, I concur in its result, for all the reasons set forth herein.\n. As discussed in greater detail, infra, the UCC provides for the uniform standards of construction throughout the Commonwealth. In the same way, the UCC also exempts, statewide, certain buildings from the strict mandates of the code. As referenced by the OAJC, \"recreational cabins\u201d are so exempted, provided:\n(i) the cabin is equipped with at least one smoke detector, one fire extinguisher and one carbon monoxide detector in both the kitchen and sleeping quarters; [and]\n(ii) the owner of the cabin files with the municipality either:\n(A) an affidavit on a form prescribed by the department attesting to the fact that the cabin meets the definition of a \"recreational cabin\u201d in section [7210.103] or\n(B) a valid proof of insurance for the recreational cabin, written and issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, stating that the structure meets the definition of a \"recreational cabin\u201d as defined in section [7210.103];\nId. \u00a7 7210.104(b)(7).\n. Local governments and homeowners' associations are preempted from imposing \"building construction standards or codes for buildings to be constructed, renovated, altered or modified.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)(i); see also id. % 7210.104(d)(1).\n. On this point, I note my disagreement with the lead Justices that \"resolution of this issue requires us to interpret the breadth of the [UCC\u2019s] preemption clause. OAJC at 1265.\n. While \"recreation\u201d is the pertinent word insofar as this analysis is concerned, I also note the definition of \"vacation,\u201d as the Glatfelters obtained a building permit from Salem Township for a \"two-story vacation home, slab on grade: stick built (recreational cabin exempt).\u201d Salem Township Permit, R.R. at 154a.\n. As proposed in HB 2149, a recreational cabin was defined as a structure which is:\n(1) used principally for the purpose of engaging in seasonal hunting and fishing;\n(2) not utilized as a domicile or residence for any individual for any time period;\n(3) not utilized for commercial purposes;\n(4) not greater than two stories in height, excluding basement;\n(5) not utilized by the owner or any other person as a place of employment;\n(6) not a mailing address for bills and correspondence; and\n(7) not listed as an individual\u2019s place of residence on a tax return, driver's license, car registration or voter registration.\n. Contrarily, the legislative history for HB 2149 contains justification for the definition of a recreational cabin. See Pennsylvania House of Representatives Legislative Journal, 2004 Session, No. 19, at 464-467 (Mar. 31, 2004) (remarks of Rep. Fairchild, noting the safety provisions contained within the recreational cabin exemption).\n. While I realize that the Bill Summary is inconsistent with the final, enacted language of SB 1139/Act 92, it is the only evidence available that allows this Court to consider \u201cthe occasion and necessity of the statute; the circumstances under which it was enacted; the mischief to be remedied; [and] the object to be attained.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(1)-(4). The explicit language of the summary makes clear that the recreational cabin exemption was found necessary by the General Assembly because enforcement of the strict provisions of the UCC was virtually impossible in extreme rural areas, and, indeed, made little sense in that context. In its wisdom, the legislature found that, so long as certain other requirements were met, the Commonwealth should not impose the rigid mandates of the UCC on the rustic sportsman who may not be anxious about substandard construction.",
