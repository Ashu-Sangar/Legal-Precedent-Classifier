    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.7",494,[310,578,1151,964]]]'>Plaintiff, a boy over sixteen and under eighteen years of age, was employed by defendant in work prohibited by the Child Labor Law and while so employed received injury necessitating amputation of three fingers of the left hand. A compensation agreement was entered into and plaintiff received payments thereunder for a period of eighteen weeks. At the end of that time a petition was filed with the board setting forth the agreement was signed under a mistake both of law and fact and that petitioner “was coerced into believing, by a representative of his employer, that the paper he signed was simply a statement as to the details connected with the accident,” and asking that the agreement be modified so as to provide compensation for loss of use of the hand. The referee refused to modify the agreement, which conclusion was sustained by the board. On appeal to the court of common pleas the action of the board was approved and this appeal followed.</p>

On the contrary the agreement was entered into with full knowledge of the extent of the injury and in the presence of plaintiff’s father and further plaintiff received and accepted payments under the agreement for eighteen weeks without complaint or objection.
