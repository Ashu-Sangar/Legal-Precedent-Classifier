Buch died in 1915, having left a last will and testament, duly probated, by which two persons were appointed executors and trustees. He was survived by a widow and eight children, and to the latter equal amounts in the estate were given. The fifth clause, however, made separate provision for the part of one unmarried boy, as follows: “I order and direct that my executors shall invest my son John’s share safely at not less than four per cent, interest, and if he dies without issue, the said share shall be equally divided among his brothers and sisters or their heirs.” The executors filed an account, which was adjudicated, and an award made to John’s trustees of one-eighth of the net estate, less $694, the amount of indebtedness. By agreement, dated June 12,1917, of all parties in interest then living, joined in by John, it was provided that he should be paid from the principal remaining $694.88, leaving in the trust account the sum of $2,000 which amount was thereafter invested at the rate of five per cent, and the income paid to him. In 1921, upon petition, a citation was directed to the trustees, asking that they show cause why the sum. in their hands should not be paid over to the beneficiary, it being averred that the trust was passive and therefore executed, and in this request the widow joined, as did one brother and a sister. After hearing, the application was refused. The respondents later resigned, and the Peoples Trust Company of Lancaster was appointed in their place. The only question raised on this appeal is <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>the right to demand a termination of the trust, and compel the payment over of the principal.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[319,461,1153,1070]]]'>The court below held, though the duty imposed by the will was merely to invest, the limitation over in case of death without issue made necessary the conservation of the estate for the benefit of the possible remaindermen. No offer was made by the life tenant to give bond for their protection, as provided by the Act of May 17,1871, P. L. 269, reenacted June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, section 23. If, however, the trust is a dry one, he is entitled to the sum held for his benefit. It is to be. noted the father made provision in his will for the petitioner in a way different from that for his other children. To the latter, he gave absolute estates, but in the case of appellant, there was an attempt to make a distinction and create a fund for the benefit of the cestui que trust, and those who might survive. This was the evident understanding of all concerned, as further appears from the wording of the agreement of June 12, 1917, in which the heirs joined, and in which it was stated in paragraph 1, “that the amount of money to be placed in trust for John Buch shall be $2,000.”</p>
