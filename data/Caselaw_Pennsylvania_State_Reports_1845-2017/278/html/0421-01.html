He became possessed of a small amount of personal property, and, in 1922, upon petition, the balance in the hands of the duly appointed committee was awarded to the Commonwealth in part payment of support which had been furnished. By the will of the lunatic’s mother, who died in July of 1912, there was bequeathed to a brother, Charles, a certain sum in trust for the purpose of investment, the income to be used, at his discretion, for the “comfortable support and maintenance” of Frederick, with the right to use part or all of the corpus of the estate for this purpose, if necessary. It was directed that this property and the income arising therefrom should not be subjected to or be in any manner liable for the debts, engagements or liabilities of the cestui que trust. The balance remaining, if any, after his death, was given to other named residuary legatees. Admittedly, this testamentary provision constituted a spendthrift trust, and such a disposition of property is valid in Pennsylvania: Dull’s Est., <a href="/pa/137/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="137 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="821425" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0112-01">137 Pa. 112</a>; Rife v.

It asked that an order be made directing him to pay from the accumulated income, and, if necessary, principal, the additional amount of $1,718.31, due for support furnished, and to direct that reimbursement for future payments be made as the same might accrue. The application was based on the authority of the Act of June 1,1915, P. L. 661, which permits recovery by the Commonwealth of moneys expended for support of the insane. An answer was filed denying liability, it being contended that the funds sought to be reached were held by virtue of the spendthrift trust, — the expenditure of income and principal being discretionary with the trustee — and, therefore, the trustee could not be compelled to appropriate, against his will, any sum in satisfaction of the claims. The rule granted was made absolute, and a decree entered directing payment.</p>

From the first date to the death of the mother, by whose will the trust was created, there had accrued an indebtedness of $889.41. There had been received from the committee, by virtue of a previous order, the sum of $712.48, the entire balance of the personal fund belonging to the lunatic in its hands. The present application asks for the repayment of all outlays from 1905, less the credit already referred to. The fund now in controversy was not established until J uly, 1912, and at no time became the absolute estate of Frederick. After its creation, amounts due for support and maintenance were properly demandable from the trustee, but not for any period prior thereto, and the award to the Commonwealth should be so limited, which results in a reduction of $176.93 from the total claim as allowed by the learned court below, and the order entered must be altered accordingly.</p>
