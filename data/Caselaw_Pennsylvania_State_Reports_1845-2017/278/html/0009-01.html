Defendants read these provisions as containing stipulations that, on the conditions existing in this case, would bar them from membership in the Castle of Protection; and, they claim, the proviso in paragraph 69, quoted above, as to funds of a dissolved castle becoming the property of the Grand Castle, should no members of the defunct subordinate join the Castle of Protection within six years, is confiscatory.</p>

It could hardly be expected that a dissolution which was irregular in form or prohibited by the laws [of the order] would be approved, until the [required] conditions were complied with, and the limitation of six months as to membership only begins when the dissolution or surrender is approved. There is not the least doubt that after this issue is determined, and the fund paid to the Grand Castle for the use of the members of Altoona Castle in the Castle of Protection, that the dissolution will be approved by <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>the executive board, and, within six months thereafter, all the appellees admitted to membership if they so desire, and the <em>appellant is willing that such provision be incorporated into the final decree</em>

This provides a trustee to take charge of the sick and death benefit fund and apply it to the purposes originally intended; but, if that security was not afforded members of a defunct subordinate association, as contemplated by the Act of 1883, plaintiff, having incorporated the statute into its laws, could be made to give such protection,- and bring itself within the statute. The provision in the laws of the order, concerning the funds of a defunct subordinate becoming, under certain conditions, the property of the parent body, “for the use of the Castle of Protection,” claimed by defendants as confiscatory, can in no proper sense be so classed; it is a reasonable provision: the Grand Castle is pledged by these laws to finance the Castle of Protection, and the Act of 1883 particularly provides that the “parent or superior body to whom any moneys, property or other effects of [a defunct] subordinate association shall be paid and delivered shall......hold the same for the purposes and intents for which they were......held by such subordinate associations.”</p>

With this view we cannot agree.</p>

It is perfectly plain that this is a mere variation in phraseology without any change of meaning, and that the statute covers a case like the present, where the subordinate association “has dissolved” of its own accord.</p>

Here, however, there has been no cancellation of charter; on the contrary, the subordinate association voluntarily, through the unanimous action of its own’members, has set about surrendering its charter. Moreover, there is no question of forfeiture of property; this is simply the case of delivering up “funds” in accordance with .the terms of an agreement which stipulates that, in the event of dissolution of the subordinate association, its “funds and other property” shall be surrendered to the head of the order, to be held in trust primarily for the benefit of those who contributed to them, as hereinbefore particularized, “in compliance with the Act of Assembly of June 20,1883.”</p>
