After taking evidence, the orphans’ court, of its own volition, sent an issue to the common pleas, and to the questions of fact thus submitted, the jury answered that the writing was legible, was executed with testamentary intent, and was signed in the chirography of decedent at the end thereof; in short, the jury found in favor of the alleged will (which names legatees to the exclusion of the three appellants, who are children of decedent’s mother by a former marriage, and who, with three aunts, constitute his only heirs at law).

L. 415, 424 (under which the present petition for probate came by certification to the orphans’ court, instead of to the long-since-abolished register’s court), is intended to take the place of section 25 of the Act of 1832 (seeReport of Commissioners, p. 379), but the Act of 1917 contains a material change in that the register of wills may now certify a petition for probate to the orphans’ court (which the Constitution of 1874 substituted for the register’s court) without a request so to do, whereas., as we have seen, the old law required a request from a party in interest to inaugurate such a proceeding.</p>

When, however, matters theretofore handled by the register’s court came to the orphans’ court, they were subject not only to the various provisions of the Act of March 15, 1832, relating to registers and registers’ courts, or such of them as could be consistently adjusted to the new arrangement, but also to the provisions of the Orphans’ Court Act of March 29, 1832, and, at that time, the last-mentioned statute contained what is now paragraph (a) of section 21 of the Act of 1917, which gives the orphans’ court broad jurisdiction to award issues in all instances where it deems such a course expedient. The Act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 206, — passed for the purpose of carrying into effect the constitutional abolition of the register’s court (article Y, section 22), — contains no abridgment of the powers of the orphans’ court, — only an <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>extension of its jurisdiction; and to this extended jurisdiction, the rules, — -statutory or otherwise, — previously existing in that tribunal, applied, rather than the narrower rules of practice theretofore controlling the register’s court. In short, the obligation imposed on the orphans’ court, to grant issues in contested will cases when so requested by parties in interest, did not take from that tribunal the general privilege theretofore enjoyed of awarding issues in connection with all matters under its jurisdiction whenever it deemed it expedient so to do; on the contrary, when issues such as these under discussion were brought within the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court, they at once became subject to the privilege just mentioned.</p>

No apparent reason can be seen why, so far as the mere right to submit is concerned, there should exist a distinction between the privilege of the orphans’ court to submit issues for the purpose of obtaining advisory findings and its privilege in relation to findings which it must accept as definitive (e. g., findings in will contests and those upon which the jurisdiction of the court depends) ; and, as we have hereinbefore decided, the law recognizes no such distinction. On the other hand, it is easy to see why, because of the difference in their respective natures, the law sets up and recognizes, as it does, limitations on the power of the orphans’ court to <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>depart from findings of a definitive character after the common pleas has reduced them to judgment, although it makes no such rule as to mere advisory findings; and this distinction in the force of the findings, rather than any other consideration, makes a difference in the nature of the judgments entered thereon, as between their being interlocutory or final, which in turn affects the right of appeal.

Co. v. People’s Tr. Co., supra, p. 390); this rule is due to the nature of the issue and in no way depends on whether or not it was sent to the common pleas at the request of one of the parties to the contest. To state the rule in another manner: Albeit, in sending the issue to the common pleas, the orphans’ court exercises the power conferred by paragraph (a) rather than that dealt with in paragraph (b) of section 21 of the Act of 1917, — that is, even though the court acts of its own volition rather than on the request of a party in interest, — if the matter in hand involves a fact going to the status as a testamentary writing, or to the validity of an alleged will, then that part of paragraph (b) which says that the facts established by the verdict shall not be reexamined, applies.</p>

The case is valuable here as <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>showing that it is the character of the issue sent to the common pleas which determines whether or not the findings there made are conclusive upon the orphans’ court, rather than the fact as to whether or not the issue was sent on request of a party in interest.</p>

Mills, <a href="/pa/103/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="103 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="449129" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0022-01">103 Pa. 22</a>), the six-months’ period does not begin to run until the final decree is entered in the latter tribunal, for, until that court either accepts or rejects the verdict, it cannot be said that any one is harmed.

As stated above, in the last paragraph, this is true as to all issues where the orphans’ court may disregard the verdict of the jury, but the rule does not control the other class of cases; wherever the verdict is conclusive until disturbed, the date of the entry of judgment thereon marks the time from which the period for taking an appeal runs.

(2) Where a substantial dispute exists on a material point of fact concerning the status of an alleged will or testamentary writing, and the evidence is of the probative value required by our decisions, the orphans’ court must send such issue to the common pleas when requested so to do by any party in interest, if that request is made in due season. (3) After judgment entered on the verdict in the common pleas, so long as the judgment stands undisturbed, the findings of fact by the jury of that tribunal are conclusive on the orphans’ court, (a) whenever the issue is of the class mentioned in Rule 2, — whether sent to the common pleas on request or otherwise, — or (b) when it involves the decision of a fact upon which depends the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court. (4) When the issue is in neither of the classes mentioned in Rule 3, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>and merely involves facts as to which the tribunal sending it desires advice, the result in the common pleas is not conclusive in any sense, but, when the judgment on the verdict is not appealed from, if followed by the orphans’ court, the Supreme Court may consider the findings of the jury as acquiesced in by the appellant. (5) In cases falling within Rule 3, the date of the entry of the judgment in the common pleas marks the time from which the six-months’ period for taking an appeal runs, while, in cases within Rule 4, the date of the final decree in the orphans’ court marks the date from which the judgment on the issue in the common pleas becomes final for purposes of appeal. (6) In the class of cases covered by Rule 4, where the verdict is not binding, the refusal of an issue will not be reviewed on appeal (Thompson’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="103 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="449085" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0603-01">103 Pa. 603</a>, 607) ; but when the issue is granted, and the facts found thereon are adopted as the basis óf a final decree by the orphans’ court, the party thus aggrieved may appeal from such decree and at the same time appeal from the judgment of the common pleas on the feigned issue (Green v. Mills, <a href="/pa/103/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="103 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="449129" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0022-01">103 Pa. 22</a>). (7) The refusal of an issue in cases covered by Rule 2 will be reviewed on appeal when the record shows, by evidence of the probative value required by our decisions, that a substantial dispute on a material question of fact exists, but not otherwise (Fleming’s Est., <a href="/pa/265/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="265 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1051881" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0399-01">265 Pa. 399</a>, 406; Tetlow’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>, 495-6).</p>
