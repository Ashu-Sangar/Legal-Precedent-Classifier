While the obligation here sued on was executed since the date of the Act of 1917, supra, the acceptance of the bond by the city evidently was not intended as an exercise of the latter’s power under that statute; in this and other respects, the case before us is much like Lancaster v. Frescoln, <a href="/pa/192/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="192 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="909031" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0452-01">192 Pa. 452</a>, 456, and <a href="/pa/203/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="203 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="994745" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0640-01">203 Pa. 640</a>, 643. There, as here, “the bond was given by a contractor to a city and recited that the contractor <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>should perform Ms work, pay Ms laborers and for the material used.” The action, like the present one, was brought in the name of the city to the use of parties who furnished materials, and the defense was made by the surety “in its own interest only,” the first ground of defense being that “the bond imposed on it, the surety, no liability to the use-plaintiffs.” Lancaster v. Frescoln arose prior to the Act of 1917, but so far as the presence on the statute books of that act figures as a circumstance in the case at bar, it finds a parallel in the Lancaster Case, where a “general ordinance of the city,” like the Act of 1917, provided for the giving, by contractors, of “additional bonds” to the municipality “for the use of any persons who may be aggrieved by the contractor’s failure to pay for work done or materials furnished.” In deciding in favor of the surety, we said: “The special ordinance, authorizing the [improvement], required the contractor to enter security for the faithful performance of the contract......This bond was not given under [the terms of the general] ordinance; it is <em>not an additional bond, </em>and it is not for the use of third parties. It was given under the special ordinance, and its conditions correspond with the stipulations of the contract. In an action against a surety the obligation of a bond cannot be. extended beyond the plain import of the words used. This bond is given to the City of Lancaster, and primarily for its benefit; it is the only party entitled to sue, and no recovery can be had except in its right.” When the matter was again before us, in <a href="/pa/203/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="203 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="994745" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0640-01">203 Pa. 640</a>, 644, 645, we adopted the opinion of the court below, per curiam, wherein the case against the appellant is well put in the following question and answer: “Suppose......the contractor......failed to pay [for] labor and materials [and] the aggregate of both claims more than equaled the amount of the bond, could......[the] laborers and materialmen ......[exhaust the security for their own benefit] ......to the peril of the city, in case of default by the contractor in fulfilling the terms of his contract? Under <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>no circumstances could the surety be called on for more than the amount of [the] bond......[and] it is obvious that the purpose of the city, both in spirit and letter, was only to protect its own rights.....; the bond...... [is] for the benefit of the city......alone and not for the use of the materialmen and laborers, except as the city [might see] fit to use it for that purpose [in its own right].”</p>

Frescoln, <a href="/pa/203/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="203 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="994745" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0640-01">203 Pa. 640</a>, 643, 644, 645) ; the bond was not in any sense intended to create or acknowledge a direct obligation to laborers and materialmen. The court below, therefore, was right in holding that.“the case at bar does not fall <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>within any of the exceptions to the well-settled rule of the common law, that one not a party to an obligation cannot maintain an action thereon”; and, as already shown, no facts which “give him the right to use the name of the obligee” are averred in appellant’s statement of claim; this we held to be essential in Board of Education v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/252/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="252 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1021584" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0505-01">252 Pa. 505</a>, 506.</p>
