In 1885 the latter gave the Water Company, appellee, — chartered in 1883, for the purpose of “supplying water to the borough and vicinity of Lykens,”— the right to use any surplus flow not needed by it. By the legislation in force the grantee had the power to condemn, but no effort to make use of this privilege was at the time attempted, and it operated within its chartered limits under the deed referred to. After the pas<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>sage of the Act of May 21, 1901, P. L. 270, property holders adjoining the borough took advantage of its provisions, and, by due proceedings, the right to supply water was extended to the new territory. In 1911, those residing beyond asked for similar benefits, and again a petition was presented in the manner designated by law. In this instance, the land added was not contiguous to the borough line, but adjoining that covered by the first expansion.</p>
    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[161,824,1153,915]]]'>Plaintiff became possessed, by descent from his father, —the latter having purchased in 1905, — of the fee to the property of the grantors who conveyed the original water right to the Lykens Coal Company. He complained of the extension of territory to be supplied when the effort to do so was made in 1911, but the exceptions filed attacking the regularity of the action were dismissed, and it is admitted the requirements of the Act of 1901 were complied with. Question is raised, however, as to the power of defendant to take water adversely to furnish service to the new consumers so added, and the condemnation for this purpose is here challenged by a bill in equity, filed in 1911, to restrain the proceedings which had been regularly begun with this purpose in view. Ten years later the case was brought to trial, and a decree finally entered for the defendant, from which this appeal is taken.</p>

If he has any standing, it must be found in the power given the court to review certain corporate acts by the statute passed in 1871 (Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360). The applicability of this legislation to various classes of cases has been in the past the subject of many decisions by this court, and, due to the difference of facts involved, led to the making of statements in opinions which seemed to be divergent, and caused confusion. The authorities dealing with the subject have been so ably and recently summarized by the present Chief Justice (Gring v.

White Deer Mt. Water Co., supra, permitted expansion of territory upon petition of property owners, duly recorded, and, thereafter, the water company was privileged to extend its service, and the procedure, required to effect this result, was followed here. We now find express authority for developing the public service of a company, chartered under the Act of 1874, with its supplements, into a definitely fixed “vicinity.” It is true nothing is said in the statute mentioned of the right of eminent domain, but this privilege had already been conferred to cover the necessities of the borough, and, when the legislature saw fit to permit the broadening of the scope of its activities, giving, as noticed, additional rights to water companies, and incidentally imposing reciprocal duties upon them, if advantage was taken of the act, the original grant of power followed; otherwise the new obligations assumed <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>could not, in many cases, be complied with. In principle, this is recognized in Burkhard v. Penna. Water Co., supra, p. 54, when it is said: “The increasing demands on the company for additional service compel the company to enlarge its plant as occasion requires which can only be done effectively by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
