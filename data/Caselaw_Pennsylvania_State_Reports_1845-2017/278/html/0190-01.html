No lease <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>had been executed between the parties, and, to indemnify appellee, appellant’s vendor, Bosetti, turned over, as security, the machinery and property to be placed in the building for the cost of remodeling it. The pledge was to continue pending the actual execution of the lease and occupancy of the premises thereunder as tenant, or until the cost was paid.</p>

Appellant asserts, as the negotiations contemplated a lease, it should be considered in fact made, and under these circumstances there could be no pledge. This is not in accordance with appellee’s theory or the facts of the case. The vendor negatived any such idea when he sold the property to a stranger, who immediately instituted replevin. The negotiation at best was but an agreement for a lease to be reduced to writing, when the other party to the contract was known: Sausser v.

He did not, under the facts, waive his rights as a pledgee, and should not be held solely to the lien of the warrant. He may claim the property pledged against a purchaser for value from the bailor. Appellant’s contention in opposition is an erroneous conception of the law, due to a misapplication of the governing legal principles to the facts in the case.</p>

A. 714</a>, with like cases, is authority for the principle that in states where chattel mortgages or such instruments exist, title under the common law is transferred to the mortgagee. There is either no right of redemption or none that will be recognized as subject to an attachment. So, where a creditor sues out the latter writ to attach personal property covered by a chattel mortgage, and thereafter purchases the mortgage, inasmuch as the title by law is then vested in him, the two liens are inconsistent, and the lien of the mortgage is ordinarily lost. Where a pledgee institutes suit at law to recover judgment for the same debt, and attaches the pledged property, he abandons his pledgee’s right, and is estopped from asserting any other than a lien by attachment: Citizens Bank of Greenfield v.

That is,......they might both affirm and deny their own title; claim under the writs or adversely to them; might hold the plaintiffs in those writs for the whole value of the property, or, failing in this, might nullify their own words and acts, and, as landlords, claim the fund as the product of their tenant’s goods.

McKean, supra; Schouler on Bailments (ed. of 1905), section 186, page 102. By the act and at common law, execution is permitted against the redemption in favor of third persons; there is no reason for a different rule where the creditor in the execution is the same person as the pledgee of the property, where he seeks to collect an indebtedness different from that by which the property is held in pledge. In this case, on appellant’s theory, there was an indebtedness due on a supposed lease, and a second liability incurred in remodeling the building. But as there really was no lease, the landlord’s warrant was a nullity, abandoned before any effective steps were taken under it.</p>
