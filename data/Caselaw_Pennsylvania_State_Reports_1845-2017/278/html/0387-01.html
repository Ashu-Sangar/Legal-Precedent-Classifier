Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co., 3 Dist.

Moreover, the return in the instant case is certainly no stronger than the averment which, on demurrer, was held insufficient in Hodder v.

At common law “unless the charter provides otherwise, a shareholder in a trading corporation has the right to inspect its books and papers and to take minutes from them, for a definite and proper purpose, at reasonable times. The doctrine of the law is, that the books and papers of the corporation, though of necessity kept in some one hand, are the common property of all the stockholders,......[their right, in the case of] joint stock corporations, to inspect the accounts and papers, [being] similar to that of members in large partnerships, where managers are ap<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>pointed to transact the business”: Com. ex rel. v.

    <p id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[299,960,1149,745]]]'>It follows that when a stockholder applies for a mandamus, because of a refusal to give him sueh a list, or to allow him to copy it from the books of the corporation, and states a legal and proper reason why he desires to have it, the corporate officers, who deny his right to it, have a heavy burden to carry. Of course, “the writ should not be granted for speculative purposes, or to gratify idle curiosity, or to aid a blackmailer, but it may not be denied to a stockholder who seeks the information for legitimate purposes”: Guthrie v. Harkness, <a href="/us/199/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="199 U.S. 148" data-case-ids="3643870" data-case-paths="/us/199/0148-01">199 U. S. 148</a>.

Empire Passenger Railway Co., <a href="/pa/134/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="134 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="814930" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0237-01">134 Pa. 237</a>, to which reference has already been made. In it relator claimed, under article XVII, section 2, of the Constitution, that he was entitled to “obtain a list of the stockholders, so that he may confer with his fellow stockholders, in order that they may join him” in a bill in equity to set aside, as “illegal and fraudulent,” a lease attempted to be made by the company, “and share the expenses with him.” We reversed the court below for awarding a mandamus, giving as our reasons that relator “does not allege that he will be in any way injured, or that there are others whose <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>rights will be injured, or that they are necessary parties, or that he cannot maintain his bill without them. He simply claims an absolute and unqualified right, not merely to inspect the books and stocklist of the defendant, but to make a copy of the list of stockholders, and for the one purpose mentioned. The Constitution of 1874......does not confer any such right. It simply provides that a list shall be kept at the office of the company, and that it shall be open to the inspection of stockholders and creditors, but does not confer the right to take copies of the list......In the present case, the relator desires to have an opportunity to solicit other stockholders to join him......[only] because he desires them to share the expense of such litigation with him...... [He] does not even say that he is too poor to carry on the proposed litigation himself.”</p>

The Constitution places no limitation on the absolute right, given to stockholders in the particular kinds of corporations named therein, and hence a relator need state no reason why he desires such a list: 10 Cyc. 956; 7 R. C. L. 326; Scott v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/266/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="266 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1055994" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0052-01">supra;</a> Roush v.

    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[298,469,1149,1071]]]'>Clearly, also, the insinuation, quoted from the opinion, that the relief sought might in any degree depend on the wealth or poverty of a litigant, suggests that there must be error in a conclusion based upon it; and the intimation — for it hardly rises higher than that — that relator had no right to make a copy of the list of stockholders, since the Constitution did not expressly assert he was entitled to do so, must be treated as incorrect, because unnecessarily hampering him in the exercise of his constitutional right, and because also it is in direct opposition to what we said on this subject in Com. v. Phœnix Iron Co., supra, and Hodder v. George Hogg Co., supra. True, these last named companies were not in the classes specified in the constitutional provision, which, however, so far as it has any additional effect, is “not intended to abridge the stockholder’s common-law rights, but rather to enlarge and extend them by removing some of the common-law limitations” (14 C. J. 854) and hence must be so construed as to effectuate and not to defeat that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[298,1552,1148,250]]]'>On full consideration, we have concluded that Com. v. Empire Passenger Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/134/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="134 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="814930" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0237-01">134 Pa. 237</a>, was erroneously decided, and, since it tends to mislead both courts and litigants, when dealing with this subject, it is now overruled.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.7",420,[300,1823,1147,194]]]'>We have carefully examined all our other reported cases, whether or not cited by the parties to this appeal, and find nothing conflicting with our conclusions above stated.</p>
    <p id="b420-7" data-blocks='[["BL_420.8",420,[346,2038,879,41]]]'>The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
