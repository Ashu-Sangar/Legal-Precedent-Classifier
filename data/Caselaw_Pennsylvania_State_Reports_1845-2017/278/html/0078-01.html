    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[133,581,1152,979]]]'>The property was insured, and the day after the fire an agent of the insurance company visited the premises and, with the knowledge of representatives of each party, directed the street front of the first floor to be boarded up, at some distance out from the building line. Neither party authorized it to be done, but each knew of it and neither objected to it; in fact it was beneficial to both, for without it a trespasser could have entered the building and injured it and defendant’s personalty in the first story; and being there could, with comparatively little difficulty, have obtained access to and despoiled the second and third floors. Subsequently, and apparently without the request or consent of either party, the town officials removed that structure, because it intruded upon the footway, and substituted another one, flat against the front of the building. In each of these constructions there was a doorway, the key of which was in the possession of defendant’s janitor.</p>
    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[128,1573,1153,754]],["BL_108.1",108,[277,316,1150,735]]]'>For a couple of months after the fire defendant paid rent for the entire building as theretofore; but after-wards refused to pay anything further, because, as he alleged, plaintiffs were responsible for those structures, which, while they existed, deprived him of the beneficial use of at least a part of the building, and hence suspended his duty to pay the rent. Under a power contained in the lease, plantiffs thereupon caused a dual judgment to be entered as by confession, (1) for the whole amount of rent due and to become due, until the end of a renewal term named in the lease, and (2) in ejectment for possession of the property. This was followed by a rule upon plaintiffs to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, and later by an addi<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tional rule why it should not be stricken off. Evidence whs taken, and the court below, limiting itself to a consideration of so much thereof as was applicable to the questions raised by the petitions and answers (as should always be done both below and here: Fisher v. King, <a href="/pa/153/0003-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="153 Pa. 3" data-case-ids="840268" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0003-01">153 Pa. 3</a>; Bauer v.

From the orders then made we have these two appeals, one by each party, all the questions in which, if raised by the pleadings, will be decided in this opinion; others were argued, which might have been more serious, but will not be considered because not raised on this record.</p>
    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[274,1071,1150,1128]]]'>The lease provides: “And the said second party [defendant] hereby confesses judgment in favor of the said first parties [plaintiffs] for the whole amount of said rent as hereinbefore set forth, waiving stay of execution, inquisition and all exemption laws, and five per cent to be added as attorney’s commission for collection.” This is a provision separate and distinct from the one authorizing the confession of a judgment in ejectment, and is similar to that contained in an ordinary judgment note. Under it plaintiffs had the right to enter a judgment for the rent stipulated in the lease, whether or not there was a default: O’Maley v. Pugliese, <a href="/pa/272/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="272 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1068427" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0356-01">272 Pa. 356</a>, 358. As was said in that case, so also it may be said here: “The judgment was confessed as provided in the bond, and, the warrant being without limit as to time, it was not necessary to await the maturity of the obligation (Integrity Ins., etc., Co. v. Rau, <a href="/pa/153/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="153 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="840356" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0488-01">153 Pa. 488</a>; Volkenand v.

For this reason neither act could operate to suspend the payment of rent. Plaintiffs are responsible only for what was done by or for them; silence no more estops them than it does defendant. They were not required by the lease to restore the building, and hence he is not aided by their failure so to do.
