Its capital stock of thirty-five thousand dollars was divided into three hundred and fifty shares of one hundred dollars each; of which the plaintiff, Edwin F. Saxman, the defendant, Vance C. McCormick and James M. Cameron, each owned one hundred shares, and all were directors and officers of the corporation, although Saxman looked more especially after the mining. The business prospered until the mine was accidentally flooded in September, 1904; then Saxman became discouraged and offered to dispose of his stock to Cameron and McCormick, who desired to continue the business. At first Saxman asked $10,000 for his stock, but after some negotiations sold it to McCormick for $2,500 and his release as an endorser upon $7,500 of the corporation’s notes, with the disputed question as. to a further consideration involved in this suit. This mining lease was near the main line of the Pennsylvania Rail<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>road Company, but for some time prior to tbe transfer of stock tbe coal company had been so crippled by lack of cars that tbe question of bringing suit against tbe railroad company for damages,, by reason of illegal discrimination, bad been under discussion by tbe officers of tbe coal company. Thereafter, in 1909, sucb suit was brought and final judgment recovered in 1916 against tbe railroad company for $153,489.77, which was paid into tbe treasury of tbe coal company. This suit is based on plaintiff’s contention that, as a part consideration for tbe sale of bis stock to defendant, tbe latter agreed, in effect, to pay him (plaintiff) bis pro rata share, according to tbe ¿mount and time of bis holdings, of whatever might be recovered from tbe railroad company in case suit was brought against it for tbe alleged discrimination. This tbe defendant emphatically denied, and at tbe trial tbe case turned on tbe disputed question as to whether sucb an agreement bad been made. Tbe unlawful discrimination in question extended over a period of four years, during twenty-one months of which plaintiff owned fifteen thirty-fifths of tbe stock, and tbe jury, finding in bis favor, awarded him fifteen thirty-fifths of seven-sixteenths of tbe total amount recovered from tbe railroad company, which was agreed at tbe trial to be tbe correct amount, if plaintiff was entitled to recover. Defendant brought this appeal from judgment entered on tbe verdict.</p>

Tbe stock was transferred under an oral contract, and tbe correspondence, while pertinent, neither reduces tbe oral agreement to writing nor modifies it; hence, plaintiff’s testimony was not in contradiction of a written agreement. The correspondence which follows tbe oral agreement refers to tbe $2,500, and tbe release of plaintiff from bis liability as endorser for tbe corporation, but is silent as to any further consideration, and hence, is important as tending to show what tbe oral contract was: see Briggs &amp; Turivas v.

True, the money recovered from the railroad company went to the coal company, but each of its stockholders was equitably entitled to share pro rata in the enhanced value of the corporate property resulting therefrom. Therefore, if defendant undertook to pay plaintiff what, as a stockholder, he would gain by a recovery against the railroad company, it was not a void undertaking.</p>

Plaintiff had no interest in nor connection with the coal company after he parted with his stock; nor could he be affected by the result of its subsequent management. His claim here is not against the coal company but against Mr. McCormick, individually. Moreover, if liable for such debts, plaintiff would be entitled to what would equal his pro rata share of the recovery from the railroad company for the entire four years of discrimination, which he neither claimed nor recovered.</p>

The question of fact as to the existence of such an agreement as plaintiff claimed was fairly submitted to the jury and it was not error to instruct them that if they found there was such an agreement plaintiff would be entitled to recover. While the jury must find the existence and terms of an oral contract, it is not error for the trial judge to instruct them as to the result of such findings.

Neither can the question as to the alleged variance between the proof and the pleadings be raised here, not having been raised in the court below.
