      <em>1. </em>In an action against the estate of a decedent to recover an alleged loan, the mere fact that deceased endorsed a note made by plaintiff, the proceeds of which were paid to a third person, is not sufficient to sustain a recovery, where there is no proof that decedent received any benefit therefrom.</p>

    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.8",166,[278,640,1154,1398]]]'>Plaintiff’s appeal from judgment entered for defendant n. o. v. cannot be sustained. Peter B. Esbenshade, the plaintiff, and Christian B. Esbenshade, defendant’s testator, were brothers and the former’s claim is in effect for a loan of $5,950, alleged to have been made to the deceased in 1907. A fatal defect in plaintiff’s case is lack of evidence of the loan. True, plaintiff was the maker and Christian the endorser of a note for that amount discounted at the bank, the proceeds of which were paid to one William L. Kendig, but there is no proof that the deceased received any benefit therefrom. The note was renewed from time to time until 1909, when Christian’s name was dropped and another brother became the endorser until plaintiff paid the note in 1910. It is the latter’s theory that the proceeds of the note were used in the purchase of stock in the National Scale and Hardware Company, but there is no sufficient evidence of such purchase, or, assuming there was, that it was made by or for Christian; while payment of the note by plaintiff without, so far as appears, making any claim for reimbursement until after Christian’s death in 1921, strongly tends to discredit the theory of a loan. The loose declarations by Christian to plaintiff’s son and other third parties, expressing an intention to repay plaintiff, are insufficient to establish a legal liability, in the absence of proof of an indebtedness.</p>

If so, they would <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>create no legal liability, as no one is under even a moral obligation for a loss resulting from Ms bad advice if honestly given: Martin’s Est., <a href="/pa/131/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="131 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="810310" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0638-01">131 Pa. 638</a>; and see Rask v.
