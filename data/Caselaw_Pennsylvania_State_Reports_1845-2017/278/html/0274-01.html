In accordance therewith Third Street was vacated south of Mulberry Street; and the latter street was so narrowed and changed that direct vehicular traffic by it, to the westward, was entirely cut off before reaching the main system of streets in that direction, only subways for pedestrians being provided at its intersections with Front and Second streets.</p>

The vacation, <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>narrowing and changing above specified, of course deprived this property of all access southwardly along Third Street, and westwardly along Mulberry Street, to the extent indicated. Claiming that this resulted in considerably depreciating the value of his property, plaintiff applied for a jury of view; from its report an appeal was taken to the court below; and, on the trial of the issue there awarded, plaintiff recovered the verdict and judgment in this case. From the latter the city appeals to this court, averring that although all of the witnesses, — its and plaintiff’s alike, — testified that the value of his. property had been greatly lessened by these improvements, still he was not entitled to recover, because it did not actually abut on the vacated portions of either of those streets.</p>
