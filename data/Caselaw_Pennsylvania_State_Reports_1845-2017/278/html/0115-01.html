Laughead. Defendant is successor in title of Laughead, and plaintiff has title to the surface land of the farm and to the reserved coal, subject to the Palmer deed. The surrounding coal was made up of three separate tracts, which were conveyed with mining rights, including release of damages, and the right to transport other coal through the openings made. The reserved coal is between two of the other described tracts, and as to it the Palmer deed provided: With the further right to said second party, his heirs and assigns, to make, keep, and maintain and use headings, entries, ways, and passages, such only, however, as are necessary for the mining and transporting of the above-described coal and coal from other tracts, and for supplying and carrying away water in and through the nine-foot or Connellsville vein of coal in and under the parcel of said Palmer’s land described on plot hereto attached and numbered 4, containing 2 acres and 159 perches.’</p>

In this......there was no error......; defendant had a right to remove the coal, but not to convert it to its own use.</p>

The right conveyed by the deed was to ‘make, keep, and maintain and- use headings, entries, ways, and passages’ through the reserved coal. The right was nothing more than a right for passageways for haulage, ventilation and drainage. The fact that the passageways opened were underground does not call into operation any principles of law different from those applicable to other rights of way.”</p>
