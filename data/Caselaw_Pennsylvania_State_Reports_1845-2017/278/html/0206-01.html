Marshall, at his death in 1900, owned personal estate of the value of $288,854.91, made up chiefly of foundry stock, machinery and appliances. His outstanding debts aggregated $201,399.66. By his will he directed “that none of my real estate shall be sold during the continuance of the trust,” and that the foundry <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>should be operated under his son’s management; if it should not prove to the advantage of the trust estate, the property might be leased or sold. After an annuity to his widow, he bequeathed the income to his children for life, with remainder over as to the corpus.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[273,589,1149,684]]]'>The trustee, in 1900, petitioned the orphans’ court for authority to mortgage the real estate to raise money to pay the debts, setting forth that the personal estate was insufficient for this purpose. The petition further stated the trustee was “of the opinion that it should be directed to retain at least twenty per centum of the profits of each business year to be applied by it in reduction of the principal of said mortgage, and that the interest to accrue from time to time on said mortgage should be treated as one of the expenses incurred in the operation of the plant.” The court below authorized a mortgage of $150,-000 to be applied to the liquidation of the debts of the decedent.</p>

The arrangement mentioned in the petition was substantially carried out. While the trustee did not devote all of the twenty per cent of income to the reduction of the mortgage, it accomplished the same purpose by a sale of parts of the corpus of the estate. Two accounts have been filed and approved; the third account is now before us on appeal.</p>

D. Marshall, and his representatives, $125,147.69, and the widow $58,-482.98. The foundry business was evidently prosperous, making fair returns up to 1919. It developed in recent years that plants of this character did not meet the requirements of business and are out of date. In this plant the machinery and equipment were not useful for the purposes intended, more efficient and up-to-date machinery being necessary if the plant was to be operated or leased as a going concern. This not being done, it was <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>necessary to scrap or junk it, so that the value of the plant and equipment was reduced from $240,000 to approximately, $60,000. The testator directed that as long as the plant produced an income it should be continued. It might be here noted that, had a settlement of the decedent’s affairs taken place at the time of his death in 1900, and all the debts been paid from the then present estate, the balance on hand would have been approximately $80,000, which would not have yielded the income obtained under the plan adopted, nor have left much of an estate for the remaindermen.</p>

The petition clearly intended the mortgage was to be paid off from income. Prior accounts have been filed and confirmed, wherein a part of this income was used in the reduction of the debt without any objection from appellant. It is not the case of a life tenant drawing her own check or giving an order on the trustee to pay income on account of a charge against the estate. What she did was to enter into an agreement whereby she was to be a beneficiary in an increased income which would not materialize but for the creation of this mortgage that could not be created but for some provision like the one incorporated in the petition, to wit, payment of a part of it through the income of the estate.</p>
