Then, and for a long time prior thereto, the company had in contemplation a change of line to the east bank of Beaver Creek, some distance from its present location. Numerous pieces of land were purchased along the proposed change; one in particular, owned by Strock, was so purchased in 1905, title being taken in the name of the Pittsburgh, Youngstown &amp; Ashtabula Railroad Company. It fronts on Race Street at the intersection of that and Eighth Street. At the time of the accident an old, unoccupied, two story brick house was located on this <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>lot, flush with Hace Street, a public highway. The building had been sold to a third person who had removed the rafters, roof, joists and practically all the timber, leaving the walls unsupported. They collapsed on the evening of February 23, 1919, one wall falling to the street in front, killing Leo Austin, a child ten years of age, son of the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b565-3" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[140,707,1154,417]]]'>No change had been made in the line of the railroad, and up to February 23, 1919, no construction work of any character had been done on this lot by the railroad company or the United States Eailroad Administration. Other than the fact that it might ultimately be used for transportation purposes, there is no evidence that the land was part of the system, or in any manner used by the United States.</p>

The President’s proclamation did not go beyond the power conferred by Congress, and the Federal Control Act did not enlarge that power as it relates to the question now discussed.

The companies, many of them, continued to pay dividends, collected rents of properties not necessary for transportation business, and otherwise acted as corporations. When federal control attached, this land was not only not an essential part of the transportation system, but was no part of it; nor did it at any time during such control assume such character.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[125,1087,1153,595]]]'>The present railroad company, for a number of years prior to the war, had contemplated this change of line. It had acquired a number of properties for the purpose. There remained quite a number of properties on the proposed line that had not been purchased up to the time of the last trial of this case. Construction work had been commenced from a point about ten squares south of this property, and northwardly several squares from the property. Some trestle work had been completed on other land, but no tracks had been laid. Work on the proposed improvement ceased during the war.</p>

If the government had been embarking in railroad business generally and for all time this improvement might ultimately be worth while. Federal control of the roads was special and temporary. While in control, what was needed was adequate facilities for the expeditious handling of war materials, including as well the country’s business. Now, <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>an improvement begun twelve years before, not nearly completed when the war began, stopped during the war, and not yet completed, could hardly be considered as coming within the shadow of aggressive prosecution of the war, utilizing all transportation facilities to that end. The worked portions were separated, disconnected and not useful for any purpose then and up to the present time. Such property remained with the corporation, which was vested with its rights and subject to liability as it existed prior to the act of Congress.</p>

The only evidence advanced in support of a contrary belief is the contract relating to this improvement between the borough and the company as lessee. As to this, the director general merely consented to the company’s execution and delivery of the contract. Why he did so does not appear; he was not involved in any way, nor does the contract in the slightest degree involve him. The agreement was between the borough and the company. It was assumed there was a supervising control over the company’s expenditure of money in the improvement contemplated. However that may be, the director general was not bound by any covenants in the contract. Like all contracts made subject to federal and state laws, the approval of government agencies was provided for, and the liability of the company for certain of its acts was dependent on the approval of the director general. This was merely to protect the railroad against contingencies which might arise out of federal control, and related chiefly to the time of performance. The consent of the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission was not obtained until March 4, 1919, which of itself would seem to have continued the time of performance. Such acts are not evidence of control and possession of the specific property, nor of the improvement contemplated. Had the improvement been predicated on an order of the administration, it could easily have been shown. The word “carrier” in this section refers to the transportation system as distinguished from the corporate owner (Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Ault, <a href="/us/256/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="256 U.S. 554" data-case-ids="3679471" data-case-paths="/us/256/0554-01">256 U. S. 554</a>), and it was on this character of property the section operated. It may be possible the director general could so control corporate owners in the expenditure of the latter’s funds as not to interfere with the successful Operation of the transportation system; if so, the con<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>sent of the director general obviated any difficulty on that score as well as protected it against claims by the borough if a different course were pursued; but this was not the assumption of possession and control by the government.</p>

Since the director general had no power or control over the property, he is in no way responsible for its condition.</p>
