The following morning the doctor gave the papers to counsel who had known decedent as a client. The envelope was. unsealed; when opened it contained a collection of seven pieces of paper of varying sizes, each written on one side in typewriting, and held by a wire clip. The top sheet of legal cap size, contained the clause appointing his executors, followed by his signature and the attestation clause signed by the subscribing witnesses.

We said on page 207, “There must be something in all the papers, in addition to such physical connection, to make a last will.

In cases where the entire will was under direct attack, or indirectly through some paper claimed as a part of it, or an attack was made on a paper designed to be made part of the will, we have adhered to this fundamental principle.

There were some misplaced numbers on pages that might tend to infer a page was missing, — as a matter of fact there was one page too many according to number, — yet many of the pages were signed at the bottom by the testatrix. Though there might have been some confusion in the arrangement, they were, as stated by Mr. Justice Gibson (page 290), “connected by their internal sense, by coherence or adaptation of parts.” A will is to be read coherently in the order of pages as testator intended; had all the objections urged in that case prevailed, still, as that learned jurist says, “the republication of the document when Mr. Binney called at the home, was sufficient to make the leaves a good will.”</p>

Loose sheets of paper, to constitute a will, must be connected by their internal sense. “Where, however, the continuity of a writing, otherwise complete, is attempted to be broken by the insertion into it of a clause or paragraph, written upon the same or a different page or sheet, the clause to be inserted must be plainly referred to and be susceptible also of certain identification. The reference must, as we have already shown, be complete in the body of the will. The testa<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>tor’s intention cannot otherwise appear; it cannot appear by extrinsic proof; but the identification of that which is sought to be inserted in the nature of the case, may be the subject of extraneous proof”: Baker’s Appeal, supra, 392, 393.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[295,585,1150,527]]]'>While a will need not be signed at the physical or spatial end, and pages need not follow in numerical order, there must be a sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to- its logical and internal sense, and the signature must be placed at the sequential end. And this end must not permit the substitution or interpolation of pages in advance unless they are connected as indicated. As stated in Stinson’s Est., <a href="/pa/228/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="228 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="969911" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0475-01">228 Pa. 475</a>, 479, “The order of connection must manifestly appear upon the face of the will.”</p>
    <p id="b122-6" data-blocks='[["BL_122.6",122,[293,1133,1149,1029]]]'>In the present case we have seven loose pages, fastened by a sliding clip, physically laid together as a will. The testator’s name appeared on the first page in signature, with those of the subscribing witnesses. The other pages followed. One might take any of the pages, after what may be called the proper first page, and omit it from the collection, and the balance would make a complete will. Or one might substitute, interpolate or entirely withdraw pages, without in the least destroying the symmetry of the remaining papers. Held together as they were, the leaves could be slipped out without leaving the slightest mark on them. There was absolutely nothing in them, no relation or recital, by which to indicate they were connected one to the other, except possibly two of the smaller nondispositive papers, and they in very minor matters. Standing alone, the pages contained no words of a testamentary character, except the last, and the same pages could be used in any other will, and it would be just as logical.</p>

The second page, as stated, could be taken away, and another put in its place, or it could be omitted entirely, and make a perfectly good will. There is nothing to show this page was present when testator signed, or any of the pages, except the sheet signed and witnessed.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[119,651,1153,485]]]'>The second page is about one-fourth of a legal cap sheet; it has on its face unmistakable evidence that the part cut off contained additional typewriting. The tops of letters, with the ink impressions, show this fact. What this writing was we of course do not know, and we do not intimate that those responsible for the probate of these papers knew anything about it. We mention the fact to emphasize the danger of permitting loose papers to be probated. It would subject wills to a great hazard.</p>
    <p id="b123-6" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[113,1145,1153,706]]]'>Proof of signature alone is not sufficient to establish a will which consists of a number or collection of loose leaves, or leaves insecurely fastened together. The presumption is that unattached or unsigned loose sheets, not connected by their internal sense to other pages of the will, were written after the signature of the testator: Teed’s Est., <a href="/pa/225/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="225 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="965394" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0633-01">225 Pa. 633</a>, 635; Taylor’s Est., <a href="/pa/230/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="230 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="8846120" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0346-01">230 Pa. 346</a>, 350. And, following Churchill’s Estate, supra, 100, a will is not signed at the end thereof as required by the Act of 1833 (now 1917) where unattested, unsigned, loose sheets, disposing of a very large part of an estate, are presumed to follow testator’s signature. See also Seiter’s Estate, supra, 208.</p>

His earnest desire is to have his will right in law as well as in disposition, — to be thereafter free from the possibility of fraudulent interference and substitutions by others. He is equally solicitous that the administrative and judicial officers who enforce his will shall act in the spirit he intended. It is the one time in the span of life that the giver may be unselfishly generous, unsparingly just <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>and whole-heartedly devoted. The curtain thereafter descending prohibits any earthly manifestation of his impressions, and denies to him knowledge of the effect of his dispositions by will, and the power to rectify wrong. While the practice of allowing the owner of property to dispose of it after death is of very ancient origin (Genesis 48:22), it did not exist in certain nations (4 Kent 502), and, in England, until a more recent period, was exercised under considerable restriction: 2 Blackstone’s Com. 492. It is not a constitutional or natural right, but a creature of statute law, and as such it must be governed: Kirkpatrick’s Est., <a href="/pa/275/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="275 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1075699" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0271-01">275 Pa. 271</a>; Frick’s Estate, <a href="/pa/277/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="277 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1079572" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0242-01">277 Pa. 242</a>.

It would encourage heirs or persons evilly inclined to employ every available means to get possession of a will and (acting under our decision, if these papers are found as a will) proceed to adjust it to their satisfaction. As stated by Mr. Chief Justice Mitchell in Swire’s Est., <a href="/pa/225/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="225 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="965252" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0188-01">225 Pa. 188</a>, 191, 192, reviewing Heise v.

Among these, none was more serious than the facility with which unfinished papers, mere inchoate expressions of intention, were admitted to probate as valid wills of decedents. Letters, memoranda, mere notes unsigned, which were entirely consistent with a half formed purpose, and which may have been thrown aside, and never intended to be operative, were rescued from their abandonment, proven as wills, and allowed to prevail as dispositions of property which there was much reason to believe the decedent never intended. It was to remedy this mischief that the Act of 1833 provided that <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>every will should be signed at the end thereof, that thus, by his signature in that place, the testator should show that his testamentary purpose was consummated, and that the instrument was complete. The purposes of the Act of 1833 were accuracy in the transmission of the testator’s wishes, the authentication of the instrument transmitting them, the identification of the testator, and certainty as to his completed testamentary purpose.” The law is already quite loose with respect to writings evidencing wills. In sales of personal property, deeds, and other transactions, the law is very exacting. To now go to the extent urged by the appellee is to sweep away the last protection for wills.</p>
