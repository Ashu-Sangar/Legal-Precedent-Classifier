She continued in possession but did not pay any rent, nor did defendant demand any, each apparently willing to let the existing status remain. Whatever may have been the nature of the tenancy, and as to this it is unnecessary for us to decide, she was not a trespasser, and her use and occupation of the land was permitted by defendant under a color of right, such as occupancy after termination of a lease, or after notice to quit on sheriff’s sale, or after death of a life tenant who has made the lease: Carr v. <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>H.

It is in evidence that all employees, women tenants and their children, used the paths in and about the property, and used this particular path. No objection was made to such practice, and it seems to have been recognized by defendant, apart from anything contained in the husband’s lease having a tendency to restrict the use of the property. The superintendent stated there never was any objection to the employees, their wives and children using these paths; an effort was made, however, to keep them off the cultivated land. Children used this way and others to carry meals to their parents at work, and for visiting purposes. The jury could very well find it appurtenant to the premises occupied by plaintiff.</p>

The mere fact that the boy was coming from a place on defendant’s property where he had no right to be would not lessen the measure of care which appellant must exercise at the dangerous location. It is not relieved of responsibility merely because the boy used this way in returning from some property where he was a trespasser. The crux of the case is, he had the right to use this path in the enjoyment of the property occupied by his mother. Such use is not circumscribed by what was done before he reached it.</p>

To do so would compel neighboring farmers to close up convenient paths which lead to and from farm lands, thus destroying the neighborly feeling now existing. Nor should the doctrine of permissive ways be stretched to an absurdity, so as to place the owners of wild lands, frequented by berry-pickers, in the position of being responsible for accidents happening because of some defect in the paths made through those lands. Along the mountain sides and in the many places throughout the Commonwealth where berries grow will be found well beaten paths, made by the pickers without hindrance or disturbance from the owners. We emphasize this because the judgment of the court below can be affirmed on the ground that the way in question was appurtenant to the property and the boy had a right to be where he was.</p>
