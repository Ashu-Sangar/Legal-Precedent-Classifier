Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., That whenever it shall appear to the commissioners of any county that any county bridge, heretofore, or hereafter to be, erected or constructed, is not sufficient for any cause to accommodate the public travel, it shall be lawful for the said commissioners to erect and construct a new and sufficient bridge to take the place of the then existing bridge: Provided, however, that said commissioners first have the approval of the court of quarter sessions and of the grand jury of the proper county.

It provides a different procedure as the terms of the amendment disclose : “When a river, creek, or rivulet, over which it may be necessary to erect and construct a bridge, crosses a public street, road or highway, in any city, borough, or township of this Commonwealth, and the erecting and constructing of such bridge requires more expense than it is reasonable that the respective city, borough, township or townships, or any two of them when they are adjoining, should bear, the court, having jurisdiction as aforesaid, shall, upon the representation of the proper <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>authorities of the respective city or borough, or of the supervisors of the township, or on the petition of any of the inhabitants of the respective city, borough or township, order a view in the manner provided for in the case of roads; and if, on the report of the viewers, it shall appear to the court, grand jury and commissioners of the county that such bridge is necessary, and would be too expensive for such city, borough, township or townships, or any two of them adjoining, to bear, it shall be entered on record as a county bridge. Should any county bridge, whether heretofore or hereafter erected, be insufficient, for any cause, to accommodate the public travel, it shall be lawful to proceed in said court by petition, in the manner aforesaid, with like proceedings and with the same effect as if the petition was for an original county bridge; and, upon the approval of the court, grand jury, and county commissioners, a new bridge may be erected and constructed to take the place of the bridge then existing.”</p>

Under the earlier act, the initiation of the movement for the new bridge lies with the county commissioners and they proceed as outlined in that statute and the court proceeds as directed therein. Under the.later act, the project must be initiated not by the county commissioners but by the proper authorities of a city or borough, or the supervisors of a township or on petition of any of the inhabitants of these municipal divisions. The language in the last sentence of the second act, “it shall be lawful to proceed in said court by petition, in the manner aforesaid, with like proceedings and with the same effect as if the petition was for an original county bridge” means that these proceedings shall be followed when the project is initiated by others than the county commissioners. In this view, the provisions of the Act of 1917'become inconsequential, for the reason that the last Act of 1907 provides for proceedings “in the manner aforesaid, with like proceedings and with the same effect as if the petition was for an original county bridge,” that is to say, for an original county bridge provided for by the preceding part of this amending section.</p>
