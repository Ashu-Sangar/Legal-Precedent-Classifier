    <p id="b515-9" data-blocks='[["BL_515.18",515,[151,1533,1151,476]]]'>The defendants, Wageley Brothers, were grocers at Pitcairn, Allegheny County, and owners of a delivery truck driven by one Harry Morrow who, while so doing, on October 8, 1918, ran down and killed the eight-year-old daughter of George and Amelia Gojkovic, the plaintiffs. The circumstances pointed to negligence on part of Morrow and this suit, brought to recover for such death, resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs; defendants have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b515-10" data-blocks='[["BL_515.19",515,[150,2028,1152,372]],["BL_516.1",516,[314,325,1146,426]]]'>The only error assigned is the refusal of the trial court to decide the case in defendants’ favor as matter of law, but that could not be done. Plaintiffs’ evidence indicated that defendants’ name was on the truck and, aside from that, the latter admitted their ownership and also the employment of Morrow, but offered evidence tending to show that on the occasion of the accident he was <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>using the truck for his own pleasure and not within the scope of his employment. This defense found support in the testimony of Morrow and, to some extent, in that of a boy riding with him and of one of the defendants. On the other hand, plaintiffs’ case was strengthened by the fact that the accident happened during business hours near the residence of one of defendants’ customers and that empty boxes were found in the truck.</p>

In essential features the present case is parallel with Sieber v. Russ Bros. Ice Cream Co., <a href="/pa/276/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="276 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1077577" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0340-01">276 Pa. 340</a>, where Mr. Justice Frazer, for the court, reviews prior decisions, and holds, inter alia, that a delivery truck is presumed to be operated for its owner and that the credibility of oral testimony submitted to rebut that presumption is for the jury.

While jurors may sometimes abuse the rule placing in their hands the credibility of witnesses, the ultimate responsibility rests with the courts to see that no unjust or unwarranted verdict is permitted to stand.</p>
