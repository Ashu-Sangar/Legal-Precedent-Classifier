We are not now concerned with the amount thereof or how it was made up. The measure of the damages was the difference between the market value of the property before the opening, and its market value afterwards, as affected by the opening. In fixing this latter amount, the cost defendant would thereafter have to pay for paving the avenue in front of the balance of its property, as of the width then and now established, and calculated in the way such work is charged for in Philadelphia, should have been and presumably was taken into account, not-as a distinct item of damage, but as one affecting the market value of that balance: Reyenthaler v.

(1) Was the assessment improper because calculated according to the foot-front rule? This is not made a ground of complaint, and indeed could not be in the absence of proof (and there is none) that the property was not in a built-up portion of the city, — the burden of proof upon this point, under section 20 of the Act of May 28, 1915, P.

(3) Had the city the right to rec over from defendant’s property the pro rata cost of paving a portion of the street occupied by the tracks of certain railroad companies?

We may add, although it is not necessary so to do, that many of the abutting owners, including appellant, recognize that railroad facilities along the avenue are a great convenience,, if not indeed a necessity, and utilize those tracks to bring freight to their respective properties.</p>

In the light of the foregoing statement of facts, the answer to this familiar contention is not difficult. By article XVI, section 8, of the Constitution of this State, an owner of property “taken, injured or destroyed” in the course of public improvements, is entitled to have “just compensation” therefore, which must always, on his request, be “determined by a jury according to the course of the common law.” In the exercise of this right, defendant appeared in the proceedings under which the street was opened, and proved the amount of its damages, presumably including therein, as already stated, an allowance because of the future paving of the avenue at its present width. In the instant case it also appeared before and was heard by a judge learned in the law and a jury chosen in due course, upon all the issues it chose to make, so far as they were legally relevant. No other litigant could obtain greater rights than defendant has been accorded, and therefore it has had everything guaranteed to it by the 14th Amendment: Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R. Co. v. Chicago, <a href="/us/166/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="166 U.S. 226" data-case-ids="3592880" data-case-paths="/us/166/0226-01">166 U. S. 226</a>.</p>

In Mattingly v. District of Columbia, <a href="/us/97/0687-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="97 U.S. 687" data-case-ids="3376153" data-case-paths="/us/97/0687-01">97 U. S. 687</a>, 692, it is said: “It may be that the burden laid upon the property of the complainants is onerous. Special assessments for special road or street improvements very often are oppressive. But that the legislative power may authorize them, and may direct them to be made in proportion to the frontage, area, or market value of the adjoining property, at its discretion, is, under the decisions, no longer an open question.” This extract has been repeatedly quoted and approved, as see French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., <a href="/us/181/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="181 U.S. 324" data-case-ids="8297902" data-case-paths="/us/181/0324-01">181 U. S. 324</a>, 335.</p>

Barber Asphalt Paving Co., <a href="/us/197/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="197 U.S. 430" data-case-ids="3636218" data-case-paths="/us/197/0430-01">197 U.

But that mode of argument assumes an exactness in the premises which does not exist. The foundation of this familiar form of taxation is a question of theory. The amount of benefit which an improvement will confer •upon particular land, indeed whether it is a benefit at all, is a matter of forecast and estimate. In its general aspects at least, it it peculiarly a thing to be decided by those who make the law. The result of the supposed constitutional principle is simply to shift the burden to a somewhat larger taxing district, the municipality, and to disguise rather than to answer the theoretic doubt. It is dangerous to tie down legislatures too closely by judicial constructions not necessarily arising from the words, of the Constitution. Particularly, as was intimated in Spencer v. Merchant, <a href="/us/125/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="125 U.S. 345" data-case-ids="3528098" data-case-paths="/us/125/0345-01">125 U. S. 345</a>, it is important for this court to avoid extracting from the very general language of the 14th Amendment a system of delusive exactness in order to destroy methods of taxation which were well known when that amendment was adopted and which it is safe to say that no one then supposed would be disturbed. It now is established beyond permissible controversy that laws like the one before us are not contrary to the Constitution of the United States. ......A statute like the present manifestly might lead to the assessment of a particular lot for a sum larger than the value of the benefits to that lot......Upholding the act as embodying a principle generally fair and doing as nearly equal justice as can be expected seems to import that if a particular case of hardship arises under it, in its natural and ordinary application, that hardship must be borne as one of the imperfections of human things.”</p>
