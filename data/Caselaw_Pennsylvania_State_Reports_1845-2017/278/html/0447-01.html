Richardson &amp; Co. were engaged in the mining of salt from deposits underlying about six acres of land owned by them; and, in carrying on the business, were using coal procured from an adjoining 194 acres of hill property, also owned by the firm. On that day, they entered into an agreement with Bridget Trucks, George Trucks and Thomas Trucks, who desired to purchase the business and continue the production of salt, to convey to them the “salt wells, with all the buildings, improvements and land thereunto belonging,” constituting the smaller tract, for a consideration of “2,500 barrels of good merchantable salt”; the agreement further providing that the purchasers “are to have the privilege of mining and taking coal out of the hill opposite their land under the land of said Richardson &amp; Co. so long as they may think proper.”</p>

Richardson &amp; Co., dated May 16, 1844.”</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[304,696,1151,1017]]]'>The grantees entered into possession of the salt works property, and continued the production of salt thereon. While so doing, they mined from the larger tract all the coal they desired for the purposes of the business. This continued until about 1860, when the production of salt and the taking of coal both ceased, although the grantees, or some of their descendants, lived on the smaller property until 1920. In that year Sylvester Trucks, who is alleged to have derived a part interest from the original grantees in the Richardson deed, endorsed on the agreement of May 16, 1844, what, so far as the language is concerned, constituted a formal assignment of it, to one L. S. Roberts; and at the same time sold and conveyed to him the smaller tract, “together with the following mining rights” (quoting from the original deed above set forth), and .Roberts, in turn, conveyed them to defendants, who thereupon recommenced mining coal from the larger tract. Their refusal to discontinue so doing, resulted in the bringing of this suit.</p>

Richardson &amp; Co., the deeds in this chain of title reciting that the grants are made “under and subject to and reserving therefrom the right to Bridget Trucks et al. to mine and take coal out of said tract, as assured and conveyed to them by [William H. Richardson &amp; Co.]...... and granted by their deed and released to them upon the conditions and terms therein expressed.” On the other hand, until the execution of the deeds to and by L. S. Roberts in 1920, defendant’s chain of title discloses no <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>reference to the “privilege” appearing in the Richardson agreement and deed.</p>

On defendant’s motion, judgment non obstante veredicto was entered in its favor; the court holding that a proper construction of the agreement and deed gave to both parties the right to take coal from the hill tract. On plaintiff’s appeal to the Superior Court, it was decided those documents operated as a sale of the coal in place, and vested in defendant an exclusive title to it; hence the judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[124,1033,1153,577]]]'>We allowed an appeal, and in the oral argument here it was conceded by plaintiff that if the agreement and deed did so operate, the judgment of the Superior Court should be affirmed. On the other hand, defendant admits that, if it does not own the coal, then, as there was evidence from which the jury could have found in favor of plaintiff, — which must be taken as true in determining whether the judgment non obstante veredicto should have been entered (Mitchell v. City of New Castle, <a href="/pa/275/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="275 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="1075613" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0426-01">275 Pa. 426</a>), — the judgment appealed from should be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.7",477,[124,1630,1154,693]]]'>Did then the above quoted provisions of the agreement and deed, operate as a sale of the coal in place to the purchasers of the smaller tract? In our judgment they did not, but gave to the grantees only a “privilege” to take such coal as they needed in the production of salt on the smaller tract, exactly as William H. Richardson &amp; Co. themselves had theretofore taken it; and hence this “privilege” ended when the salt works was finally closed. Although the language used is somewhat different from that employed in the agreement and deed in this case, the reasoning in Clement v. Youngman, <a href="/pa/40/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="40 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="478721" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0341-01">40 Pa. 341</a>, and Gloninger v. The Franklin Coal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%201" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="55 Pa. 1">55 Pa. 1</a>, bears out the conclusion just stated.</p>
    <p id="b478-3" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[307,319,1150,737]]]'>
      <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>In the former, the grantor .gave to the grantee “the exclusive right and privilege of searching for, digging, raising and carrying away [from certain land]......all the iron ore and limestone on said land, and also timber sufficient to enable said mines to be worked to advantage ......and also the privilege of erecting as many necessary houses and buildings as the said Hughes may require for the successful operation of an ironworks.” Hughes entered into possession and exercised the privilege granted, but did not construct an ironworks. It was held, despite the exclusive right given, that it was dependent on the building of an ironworks, and his failure in this respect avoided the intended grant of the iron ore and limestone.</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[306,1077,1150,530]]]'>In Gloninger v. The Franklin Coal Co., supra, one Wickizer “did grant, sell and convey to the said Edward Fell, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever, the free right to dig coal at [grantor’s] coal bed...... with the privilege freely to carry the coal from the said lot.” Upon a full consideration of all our prior decisions, it was held that only an incorporeal hereditament was granted; the “right” and the “privilege” being in common with the grantor, however, for reasons not affecting the present case.</p>
    <p id="b478-9" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[305,1619,1153,748]],["BL_479.1",479,[138,339,1151,482]]]'>Probably every one would concede that the taking of the coal by William H. Richardson &amp; Co., for use in the salt works, no matter how long this was continued, would not have vested in the purchasers of the works any right to continue taking coal from the hill tract, even while operating the works, unless there was a grant authorizing such taking. This fact suggests the necessity for the clause in the agreement and deed. The language there used does not aptly express a sale, but is, as it says, of a “privilege” only. If a sale had been intended the deed would normally have “granted, bargained and sold” the small tract <em>and </em>the coal in the larger one. In selling the former probably these usual and appropriate words were used (though the extract from the deed, as printed in <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>the record, does not enable ns to definitely assert this); they were not employed, however, in the grant of the “privilege,” and no reason appears why they were not, if a sale of the coal was intended. Of course this does not necessarily conclude the controversy, for if the legal effect of the words actually employed is that a sale resulted, it must be so adjudged; but, in determining whether or not such was the case, the consideration stated is entitled to much weight.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[135,832,1153,645]]]'>We cannot see, however, that the word “privilege,” as here used, effects a sale of the coal. “Privilege,” standing alone, carries only the idea of permission — a permissive use — and no additional word is employed to express any other intent. No case has been brought to our attention in which this word alone was used, except The Johnstown Iron Co. v. The Cambria Iron Co., <a href="/pa/32/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="32 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="986658" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0241-01">32 Pa. 241</a>, and Carnahan v.

Williamson, 4 East 476, is that no case can be named where one who has only a liberty of digging for coals in another’s soil, has an exclusive right to the coals, so as to enable him to maintain trover against the owner of the estate for coals raised by him.” It is true, we there said, the grant “was not a sale of all the ore, notwithstanding the stipulation that the privilege was to be given to none else, because it was to be paid for by the ton, and of course no more was sold than should be raised,” — a per<a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>tinent fact in determining that the grant was only of an incorporeal hereditament; bnt, as pointed ont in Union Petroleum Co. v.

Certain similarities exist between the language there construed and that in the present case, but the differences between the two are vital and controlling. There the grant was by James Caldwell to “George Greer, his heirs and assigns” of a certain described property and “also, the full right, title and privilege of digging and taking away stone coal, to any extent the said George Greer may think proper to do, or cause to be done, under any of the land now owned and occupied by the said James Caldwell; provided, nevertheless, the entrance thereto, and the discharge therefrom be on the foregoing described premises”;..... “then follow the habendum and covenants of warranty, in one of which this subject of the grant is called ‘the aforesaid right to the stone coal,’ and in the other ‘the right of stone coal hereby given.’ ”</p>

As already stated, the deed there, as here, ran to “heirs and assigns”; words of great significance where there is a conveyance of one thing and “also” of another, but of far less importance when the grant is of one thing “with [only] the privilege” of another.</p>

Eagle Metallic Copper Co., <a href="/pa/267/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="267 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1057790" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0015-01">267 Pa. 15</a>. In doubtful cases the presumption of law is as stated, but it has little or no applicability to the present situation. We think a real doubt does not exist; assuming it does, however, since the fact that “actions speak louder than words is sound law as well as proverbial wisdom” (Graham v. Dempsey, <a href="/pa/169/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="169 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="870672" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0460-01">169 Pa. 460</a>, 462), the most potent method for resolving it is to ascertain how, when no dispute had arisen between the parties, they consistently interpreted the language used by them. Under such circumstances, if the meaning is thus made clear, it becomes the “best of all rules of interpretation” (Funk v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/53/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="53 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="1004757" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0229-01">53 Pa. 229</a>, 248), and there is no <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>room for the application of the principle invoked by appellee.</p>
