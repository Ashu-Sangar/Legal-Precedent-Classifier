After hearing, the court below dismissed the bill. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[287,1172,1150,1183]],["BL_147.1",147,[140,319,1150,206]]]'>It is generally conceded that association with an organization which, on any occasion or for any purpose, attempts to control the relations of members of either the police or fire departments toward the municipality they undertake to serve, is, in the very nature of things, inconsistent with the discipline which such employment imperatively requires, and therefore must prove subversive of the public service and detrimental to the general welfare ; hence we are unable to say the court below erred in not holding the municipal authorities named as defendants abused their power when they acted on this view. As found by the court below, the order here in question was within the “discretion of the director,” and that discretion, being “based upon a reasonable and legal ground,” is “final.” If plaintiffs desire to retain their positions in the public service, they should have obeyed the director’s order; having elected not to do so (which, of course, was the privilege of each of them, as individuals), they cannot successfully complain of the ensuing results. We note with satisfaction, however, the stipulation of counsel, filed with the record, that plaintiffs should retain their respective positions pending the <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>determination of this case and, if the decision favored defendants, plaintiffs would resign from the association objected to; in the meantime, “their official status as employees of the city......not [to] be affected.”</p>
