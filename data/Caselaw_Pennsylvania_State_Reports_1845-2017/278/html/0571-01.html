Wettengel Boyd, one .of the legatees, appeals from the decree, contending that the shares of the several daughters, including her own, should be awarded to them absolutely.</p>

On the other hand, we have probably as often held that, in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and, if the intent to restrict the gift is clear, it must be given effect: Smith v. Piper, <a href="/pa/231/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="231 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="973863" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0378-01">231 Pa. 378</a>, 384; Schuldt v. Reading Tr.

In answering this question, the court below correctly decided that, since testator in plain words states the shares of the respective legatees shall pass to the survivors or survivor on the death of any of his three daughters, “either before or after [his own] death, without leaving issue to survive them,” his intention that the date of the death of each legatee shall be determinative is conclusively shown; these survivorships are not restricted to their occurrence within any fixed period of time. In other words, the rule of construction whereby, under some circumstances, we conclude that the testator must be taken to mean death of the legatee in his, the testator’s, own lifetime or during a life estate preceding a remainder, can have no application here, because this testator has clearly indicated by plain words that he contemplated the death of the legatees at any time, either before or after his own death, thus excluding the idea, contended for by appellant, that he meant only to provide for what should happen in the event of the death of one or more of the legatees during the continuance of the precedent life estate.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[279,1508,1152,698]]]'>The effect of the Act of 1897, P. L. 213, — which, as to devises and bequests is repealed, and its language incorporated in section 14 of the Wills Act of 1917, P. L. 403, 408, — is largely discussed both in the opinion of the court below and in the briefs of counsel. The real purpose of this legislation was to make a general rule, different from that theretofore prevailing, so as to facilitate the construction of wills wherein expressions like “die without issue” are used, and, particularly, to ordain that unless a contrary intent plainly appears, such expressions shall be construed to mean failure of issue in the lifetime or at the death of the legatee, and not indefinite failure of issue: English’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="270 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1066098" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0001-01">270 Pa. 1</a>, 5-7.</p>
    <p id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.6",600,[275,2215,1151,155]],["BL_601.1",601,[137,317,1153,527]]]'>The question of definite or indefinite failure of issue is not involved in the present case, however, since both sides seem to concede, so far as failure of issue is concerned, <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>testator meant a failure within a definite period, the sole question between them on that score being whether he meant to provide for the occurrence of this definite failure only before the expiration of the precedent life estate of the widow, or, more broadly, upon the death of a legatee at any time. Testator’s words make his meaning clear; the provision for a failure of issue clearly contemplates a definite failure at the date of the death of a legatee, be it, as the will says, at any time either before or after testator’s own death.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[140,863,1153,855]]]'>We say the will itself plainly means a definite, rather than an indefinite, failure of issue, because, in addition to other indications, it provides for the estates over, on default of issue of the first takers, passing to survivors, who were persons in being at the date of the will, which is usually accepted as indicating a testamentary design for a definite failure of issue (Mebus’s Est., <a href="/pa/273/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="273 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1070827" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0505-01">273 Pa. 505</a>, 516; Stoner v.

Finally, the act is of no aid in deciding as to the date when the survivorships between the legatees shall take effect; as before said, the will itself clearly states that these become effective on the death of a legatee, without issue then alive, at any time either before or after the death of testator.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[141,1736,1152,374]]]'>We see no error in the decree appealed from, and agree that the court below was not obliged to determine at this time, when the legatees are all alive, what, on the death of the last survivor, will be the final destination of the property involved; it is unnecessary to anticipate now the facts as they may exist then, or to decide the law applicable thereto.</p>
    <p id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[142,2117,1150,98]]]'>The assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>
