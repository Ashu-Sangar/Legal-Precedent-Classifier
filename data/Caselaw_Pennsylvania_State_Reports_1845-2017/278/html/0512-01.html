For brevity, the complainants will be termed municipalities. The commission, in its final determination, fixed a value of $14,380,000 on the company’s property attributable to Pennsylvania, applying a rate of fifty cents per thousand to a production of approximately four billion cubic feet of gas furnished each year.

The company is the owner of 132,000 acres of gas lands, leaseholds, etc., in McKean, Elk and Forest Counties, 119,000 acres in fee, carrying no other interest in the land except the gas, with the right to explore for, take and remove it. These lie in two principal productive territories, one designated the Elk field, including sixteen selected warrants of 12,732 acres, with 122 wells, ninety-two being active; the other, the Ludlow field, contains 40,000 acres, with 494 producing wells.

The committee could not agree upon the value of the gas lease holdings or gas lands, the franchise in Erie, working capital, bond discount and brokerage, capital requirements, depreciation and going-concern value. The attack on the commission’s findings is based on these items. The questions presented are: What is a proper value of the gas lands, rate of return on property employed in public service, depletion allowance, going-concern value? And should not the value of gasoline sold by another company be considered in the return?

The assembling of materials on which to base a judgment of true value is more certain in the former. Time has usually wiped out much of the evidence to show original cost. The records then kept did not account for all the various items entering into it, nor do the books of to-day, though kept with meticulous care, exactly cover such items. As stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in his concurrence in the Southwestern Bell Case, wherein the present value method is assailed, in what may be termed the last word on the subject: Originally, “stocks and bonds did not indicate the amount of capital embarked in the enterprise, depreciation accounts were unknown, and book values or property accounts furnished no trustworthy evidence either of cost or of real value.” It is here that a part of the difficulty is met, if original cost were adopted as the rule of value; and, as for a sum “prudently invested,” based not on judgment but political expediency or other uncertain factor, it is open to the grave charge of favoritism or oppression founded on socialism. It is a matter of very common observation that cost does not indicate the value of property; nor does present value indicate original cost. Present value is the basis on which all bargains and sales are conducted, from the purchase of the smallest article to the sale of gigantic steel mills. It is the economic rule of equality of exchange. Original cost, long since lost sight of, is not the basis of bargain and sale, though it is considered in fixing the present value for a rate base. Original cost cannot be used as a substitute for value. In the Minnesota Rate Cases it was contended that, as the carriers had received public lands as'a donation, any value attaching to them should not be included in the rate base. Mr. Justice Hughes, in disposing of this question, said: “It is clear that in ascertaining the present value we are not limited to the consideration of the amount <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>of the actual investment.

The company produced witnesses who testified the market value of the sixteen selected warrants was from $7,212,000 to $10,000,000, and the Ludlow field $4,000,000. It appears these gas fields were developed, defined and have been in actual operation producing gas from a known sand for a great many years, sufficient to show the quality. It is no longer doubtful among those familiar with the business, whether expert geologists or engineers or practical gas-producing men, that the remaining life of the fields can be determined with reasonable accuracy, — with as much accu<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>racy as is used in dealing with ordinary affairs of life. While this may be said to be a matter of conjecture, because not seen, as is a seam of coal, and it may suddenly end, the frequency of this in a defined territory is remarkably small. It is on such examinations large sums of money are invested. Most of the witnesses base their estimates on their knowledge of the field in general. The location of the lands was shown, location of the wells, the date each well was drilled, its depth, the character of sand in which gas was found, its thickness, the initial open flow volume of gas, the initial present rock pressure, the line pressure, the volume of gas delivered January, 1920, by each well into the line against the line pressure, together with the details of measurement on which the computation of the present volume is based. The commission finds that the Elk fields had an average daily yield of 102,000 cubic feet, discharging into the lines against a pressure of 115 pounds, and an average daily yield from the Ludlow field of 34,000 cubic feet. Disregarding the testimony of Hill and Gaffney as to value, four other witnesses testified to a demand for the supply and what natural gas lands would sell for in and about that territory. The commission, in valuing the gas holdings, stated, “Taking into consideration the total gas holdings of the respondent, with all the testimony bearing on their present value, we are of the opinion that the used and useful portions attributable to Pennsylvania should be included in the rate base at $5,500,-000.” The lowest value under the evidence was <em>$11,212,000; </em>it is apparent, from what the commission said, they proceeded on an erroneous conception of the evidence. Much, if not all, of the same testimony would have been admitted as evidence of market value in condemnation of the same land.

There may be something inherent in the land, its peculiar qualities or the use that differentiates this from other properties. We may assume these properties were acquired for the interest and benefit of the rate-payer as well as the company. Gas is a fugitive substance, it has no fixed situs; when drawn from one well it may come from any part of the territory, as it flows from one well or piece of land to another. When gas escapes to other fields, the former owner’s title is lost. As each year’s use diminishes the supply, so one part of the tract becomes exhausted, and the entire field related thereto may be exhausted. Gas sometimes lies in a pocket in a known gas field; in this it differs from coal, ore, and other minerals, and is more like oil. There is no means of reproducing the product when once taken from the earth; the company gets only the gas enclosed in the reservoir, and there is no known means of determining the quantity enclosed therein. Like many utilities, its strategic, as distinguished from its monopolistic, position in its chosen field may be an added circumstance, not only as to value but how much should be included in present value. While productivity may be considered, its place is and should be in value, and <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>the market or present value should and, as we read the evidence, did take in these conditions. Because of these qualities, while it may be possible to presently determine ■the value of the lands, in fixing the probable proportionate amount of future life of the entire tract applicable to use, useful and fair reserve, it may be, and no doubt is, impossible to delimit it with any degree of certainty either in acreage or value. There can be no graduated values of gas lands fixed as a rate base under any theory presented to us that will consider property presently used and a descending ratio until exhaustion appears, that is not the result of a pure guess. Beyond that proportion of the lands reasonably necessary to the company’s life, the rate-payer should not be required to assume the remainder as a burden.

Whether the gas lands be valued or considered on a reservoir or acreage basis, the gas is not paid for as gas until it is brought to the surface and used; in addition to the fair return on the rate base as found, there is added payment for the corpus of the estate taken away, or gas that is taken out, used and cannot be replaced. This is taken care of in an allowance for “depletion.” The fair return on the rate base is a fair return to the company for the money invested. It does not include any sum to repay capital outlay; it only pays for the use. This must follow, for a reasonable part of the gas holdings not being presently consumed but essential to the future life of the company, the carrying charges with incidentals should be allowed in the rate; we know of no more equitable rule for the amount to be fixed as its rate base, — certainly one fraught with less difficulty than the present value theory adopted by the courts.

In new fields of unknown duration, suddenly developing a large output, the highly speculative feature of these lands is well known. “The purchase of additional gas rights,” treated “as operating charges,” places on the present-day consumer an undue burden, particularly when the prices paid are high. It enables the company to recoup immediately its capital outlay.

The commission, in-reaching the value attributable to Pennsylvania, specifically found $5,500,000 went to gas holdings, leaving $8,800,000 fair value for all other classifications of rate base. The joint conference of engineers found $12,000,-000 as the latter value. Adding plant additions and working capital, the difference is $4,000,000. No agreement was reached for accrued depreciation on the physical properties. The company conceded ten per cent except as to gas holdings; the municipalities claimed 46 per cent. If going-concern value was included in the figures introduced by the commission, it is difficult to see where it has been placed. The report does not justify itself on this item. The company is entitled to an amount to be determined by the commission.</p>

The commission’s findings need not set forth the value of each separate piece of property, but there are standard classifications entering into the rate base recognized in the many decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, particularly noted in tl'e dissent in the Southwestern Bell Case. With the engineering force and assistance at hand, we see no reason, when facts are presented and determined, why they should not appear <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>under the different classifications at least with sufficient clarity that the courts may know the parties vitally interested have not been unfairly dealt with. As stated in Monroe Gaslight and Fuel Co. v. Michigan Public Utilities Commission, <a href="/f/292/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="292 F. 139" data-case-ids="3626184" data-case-paths="/f/292/0139-01">292 Fed. 139</a>, which reviews extensively the Southwestern Bell Case, the Bluefield Waterworks and Georgia Power Company Cases: “It will be noted, however, that, pursuant to a common practice, the report seeks to immunize itself against attack by a careful declaration that no one element is given controlling effect in fixing the rate base, but that actual cost, investment, capitalization, reconstruction cost, depreciation, etc., are given, and each is given, due weight in reaching the final composite conclusion. As Mr. Justice Brandéis points out, such a report, like the general verdict of a jury, suggests immunity to any attack which depends upon showing that the commission gave excessive or insufficient force to any one element. We do not see that any otherwise appropriate judicial revision can be escaped in this manner. It is the duty of the court to determine the rate base from the evidence before it; and......neither presumption nor express statement by the commission that it has given due weight to every one can prevail against the contrary inference required by the proofs.”</p>
    <p id="b560-6" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[305,1690,1147,525]]]'>The commission should find the rate to be applied for accrued depreciation. While the company’s theory may seem logical, in practice it is well known that plant efficiency depreciates each year on a percentage which can be ascertained with fair accuracy. Where there is evidence of going-concern value the report in each instance should show in plain words how much or the total sum which the commission has allowed for such value; and, if it is disallowed, the reasons for such disallowance should be stated.</p>

For some time the company extracted the gasoline and sold it. Several years ago this business <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>was taken over by the Pennsylvania Oil Company, a separate corporation, the stock of which is owned by the gas company. A large plant was erected by the oil company; it deals not only in gasoline, but oil generally; no part of this plant’s value was included in the rate base in this case. There were no dividends paid, nor were- the expenses or costs of operation shown. The Pennsylvania Oil Company paid to the gas company for the privilege of extracting gasoline like any other consumer the domestic rate for all gas passing through the gasoline plant, the residue of gas being returned to the utility. It is not necessary to state in detail why the extraction of gasoline was necessary. If this may be called a by-product of gas, and the company sold the gasoline, we doubt very much whether it could be compelled to account for the profits, being a separate and independent business, not of a public service nature nor within that law. They would be required to account for the rentals or other sums for the use of any of the utility’s properties employed in the production of the gasoline; this would include the use of the gas for that purpose. Beyond that it is questionable whether it could be compelled to account for profits in the gasoline business, any more than a water company, having a dam along a stream, operating a grist mill by water power from the same source, selling flour, grain and other products passing through the mill, though paying for the site, would be required to place their profits in the company treasury as a toll against any rate to consumers for the supply of water. On the municipalities’ theory, if the profits were large enough to pay the cost of operation, upkeep, and insure a fair return on the entire investment, the consumers of water would be entitled to water free, or all customers might be ratably reduced. It is well to stop within the utility business as it relates to the public and is controlled by the Public Service Law. No dividends were declared; there was no evidence of net profits, and for this reason alone the commission was <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>clearly right in declining to consider profits from the sale of gasoline in reducing the rate to be fixed for the customers who used gas. But the company is entitled to a fair price for the use of gas to produce the gasoline; it may include other elements of cost than the mere price of gas at domestic rates. Whether the gas company received it is not now before us on this record.</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[282,699,1150,801]]]'>The rate fixed on the output will yield a fair return on the valuation fixed for all the company’s property in Pennsylvania. It may change if a different base is adopted. Depletion per cent is an elusive quantity. Like many subjects of such nature, it must be founded on a reasonable theory. We cannot say the one used by the commission was incorrect; it appeals to us as being fair, though the gross sum might vary under this method, with a change in the rate base. We have spoken of depletion in another part of this opinion; unless changed when the report is revised, the commission’s finding is sustained. Our analysis of the evidence convinces us that no substantial error was made in computation. The tricounty valuation, while not here specifically mentioned, is covered by the general discussion.</p>
