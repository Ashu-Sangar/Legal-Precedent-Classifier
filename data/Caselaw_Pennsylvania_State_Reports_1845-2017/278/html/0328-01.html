Fishman, and both of the two persons last named (joined as defendants) wrongfully acted in concert with the first-named and principal defendant to affect adversely the title of complainants’ property. Plaintiffs further aver that the sale through which Samuel Fishman claims to have purchased their real estate was for taxes assessed during a period when he was the owner of the Morley Farm, and, because of this, they contend that, if the assessment in question did in fact cover the property here involved, the warranties in Fishman’s deed to Sarah Heller would prevent him from thus acquiring a good title against her; but they say that, as a matter of fact, there is nothing on the record of the tax assessment to show it was against their real estate. On the contrary, it is alleged the assessment was not in the name of Fishman but in an entirely different name, unconnected with the title to the Morley Farm; and, moreover, that it fails to describe the property in controversy, the assessment merely being against “a piece of land in Middle Paxton Township of 135 acres,” which acreage does not correspond with that of the Morley Farm. The bill prayed for an injunction to restrain defendants from interfering with plaintiffs’ enjoyment of their property <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>and that the tax sale, deed, etc., through which defendants claim, be set aside as clouds on Sarah Heller’s title.

More than that, the opinion (p. 518) plainly states, equity jurisdiction in this class of cases should “not [be exercised] at all where there is an adequate legal remedy available,” Mr. Justice Sharswood, in Stewart’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="78 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1040375" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0088-01">78 Pa. 88</a>, 96, also says that the remedy in equity to remove clouds from title is dependent on the fact that complainant “cannot immediately protect or maintain his right by any course of proceedings at law.”</p>

Now that the legislature has furnished to those in possession of real estate an adequate legal remedy, to force one setting up an adverse claim into a court of law for its adjudication, the reason for equitable jurisdiction no longer exists where this legislation applies, and, under such circumstances, the remedy provided must be followed. In short, under our authorities on this point, a sine qua non to equitable relief being that the complainant has no adequate remedy at law, when this remedy was given, in cases within its purview, — like that of the present plaintiffs, — equitable relief at once became unavailable.</p>

Scranton Trust Co., supra, those who complained of a cloud on their title were trustees out of possession of the real estate in controversy, and, as there pointed out, the remedy at law would not have been sufficient; this latter statement is also true of Onorato v. Carlini, <a href="/pa/272/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="272 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1068344" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0489-01">272 Pa. 489</a>. In the recent case of Octoraro Water Co. v.

Justice Mitchell which seems to conflict with the conclusions here reached and with our decision in Warrington v. Brooklyn Trust Co., supra; but, broad as the statements of the learned justice who wrote the Ullom opinion are, the case decided only that the then present plaintiff had a right to proceed at law by rule and issue under an act similar to the one now before us. The question there was whether, on the facts, the petitioner <em>could </em>proceed under the act; here it is whether, being within the terms of the statute, he <em>must </em>so proceed.</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[152,1440,1154,907]]]'>Again, appellants cite Vankirk v.

None of these judicial utterances were essential to the decisions in connection with which they were written, but, even if regarded as more than dicta, they are contrary to the later ruling of this court in Warrington v. Brooklyn Trust Co., which controls.</p>

      <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>A thorough examination of our decisions shows Mr. Justice Mitchell to have been the sole judge of this court, with one possible exception, who entertained the view that a statutory remedy, where applicable to a particular case and capable of affording full relief therein, did not supersede a previously existing remedy in equity. The only authority relied on by Judge Mitchell which suggests support of his opinion is Wesley Church v. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20275" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="10 Pa. 275">10 Pa. 275</a>, 279-80, where Chief Justice Gibson, in a long and labored effort to work out the equities of a hard case, incidentally and quite unnecessarily, (for he had previously shown that the then present complainants had no adequate remedy at law), remarked that “an extension of remedy at law does not supplant the relief that was to be obtained in equity”; but these words can be explained by the statement that, while a remedy provided at law may not necessarily “supplant” in every case a previously existing equitable remedy, this is far from saying the latter is not excluded where the former applies and affords complete relief. Any other view would be contrary to the general trend of Pennsylvania law (see authorities cited above under our reference to the Act of 1806 and the rule as to the exclusiveness of an adequate legal remedy) and the bulk of the latest decisions in other jurisdictions.</p>

Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20L.R.A.N.S.%2049" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="12 L.R.A.N.S. 49">12 L. R. A. (N. S.), 49</a>, 78, “The courts are not in harmony as to the effect of statutes providing a legal remedy where formerly the remedy was in equity by bill to quiet or remove cloud from title,” yet the article entitled “Cloud on Title,” in Ruling Case Law (vol. 5, p. 637, sec. 4), states the prevailing rule. It is there said: “The general rule is that equity will not entertain jurisdiction in actions to quiet title where there is a complete and adequate remedy at law, and where there is no danger from delay, and no other ingredient that requires the effective powers of equity to prevent fraud or injustice. In a case, therefore, where the remedy at law <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>is adequate and complete, the complainant is remitted to such remedy; whether it be ejectment, trespass, writ of entry, or other appropriate proceeding at law.” Then, coming to facts measurably like those of the present case, the text continues (at p. 640, sec. 8): “Where defendant claims title as purchaser at a tax sale made under a judgment rendered in an action to which plaintiffs were not made parties, and plaintiff claims the legal title, relief cannot be granted in equity.” See also, 4 Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence, 4th ed., sec. 1399.</p>

Trust Co., yet we must modify the decree dismissing the bill, because section 2 of the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, provides, if a demurrer stating the suit should have been brought at law be filed, “that issue shall be decided in limine, before a hearing of the case upon the merits ......[and] if the court shall decide that the suit should have been brought at law, it shall certify the cause to the law side of the court at the costs of plaintiff”; this course should have been pursued in the present case: Costley v.
