The discrediting testimony chiefly relied on by contestant, however, is that of a handwriting expert who compared the autograph in question with others, admittedly genuine but by no means made at a time contemporaneous with it. He testified that, in his opinion, the disputed signature was a forgery because it had inherent qualities inconsistent with the conditions under which it was alleged to have been made, — it was too forceful and too careful for a weak invalid to have written in bed. The contrary opinion, expressed by four disinterested witnesses familiar with decedent’s signature, is fortified by testimony both of the attesting witnesses and of a medical specialist who examined decedent on the day preceding the date of the <em>will; </em>the latter stated that, in his opinion, Mr. Bellows’s signature would not be shaky as he had no tremors, and that the muscular weakness of sleeping sickness is in the eyes more than the arms. Moreover, according to uncontro<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>verted testimony, the decedent, in practicing writing his name just before signing the will, remarked, “I can write better now than when I was well.” Even though a man be physically weak, and propped up in bed as he writes, it is not unnatural, when he is about to affix his name to so important a document as his last will and testament, for him to summon his strength for a moment and write his signature with its usual force and accuracy.</p>

When viewed in the light of the strong direct testimony favoring the genuineness of the signature, the meagre proofs of a forgery relied on by appellant are insufficient to sustain a finding against the will, and hence there is no substantial dispute upon a material question of fact: Fleming’s Est., <a href="/pa/265/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="265 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1051881" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0399-01">265 Pa. 399</a>, 406; Tetlow’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>, 494, 495.
