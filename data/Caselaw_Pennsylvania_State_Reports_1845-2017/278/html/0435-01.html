On this point the court below well said: “Deeds, mortgages, letters, powers of attorney, agreements, cheeks, notes, etc., have all been held to be, in legal effect, wills. Hence, an assignment (Coulter v. Shelmadine, <a href="/pa/204/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="204 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="927475" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0120-01">204 Pa. 120</a>), ......a deed (Turner v.

    <p id="b464-8" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[296,1268,1149,748]]]'>It is equally clear that where, as here, the words “if enny thing hapens” condition the gift, they strongly support the idea of a testamentary intent; indeed they exactly state what is expressed in or must be implied from every will. True, if the particular contingency stated in a paper, as the condition upon which it shall become effective, has never in fact occurred, it will not be admitted to probate: Morrow’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="116 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="554379" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0440-01">116 Pa. 440</a>; Forquer’s Est., <a href="/pa/216/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="216 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="950463" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0331-01">216 Pa. 331</a>. In the present case, however, it is clear the contingency, “if enny thing hapens,” was still existing Avhen testator died suddenly on the same day he wrote and mailed the letter; hence, the facts not being disputed, the question of testamentary intent was one of law for the court: Davis’s Est., <a href="/pa/275/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="275 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="1075682" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0126-01">275 Pa. 126</a>.</p>

In the present case this is apparent from the paper itself; and in this light the language now quoted must be <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>construed: “I think we are gone to have one of the hardest [winters] Plenty of snow and Yerry cold verry cold.

    <p id="A8qP" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[170,816,1154,695]]]'>When resolved into plainer English, it is clear to us that all of the quotation, preceding the words “I have some very valuable papers,” relate to the predicted bad weather, a doubt as to whether decedent will be able to go to Glencoe because of it, and a possible resolution of it in his next letter; the present one stating “we will see in the next letter if I come.” This being so, the clause relating to the valuable papers begins a new subject of thought, and since the clearly dispositive gifts which follow are made dependent on no other contingency than “if enny thing hapens,” and death did happen suddenly on the same day, the paper, so far as respects those gifts, must be treated as testamentary.</p>
    <p id="b465-9" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[169,1523,1152,586]]]'>It is difficult to understand how the decedent, probably expecting an early demise, — as appears by the letter itself, and the fact of his sickness and inability to work, during the last three days of the first or second week preceding, — could have possibly meant anything else than a testamentary gift, when he said “so if enny thing hapens [the property specified] goes to George Dari and Irvin”; and why, if this was not intended to be effective in and of itself, he should have sent it to two of the distributees named in it, telling them to “Kepp this letter lock it up it may help you out.”</p>

L. 403, 405, — which is a reenactment of section 6 of the Wills Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249,— reading as follows: “Every will shall be in writing, and <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in. his presence and by his express direction.” The letter, now being considered, was all in the handwriting of decedent, including the word “Father,” at the end of it; and hence the point to be decided would appear to resolve itself into this: Does the word “Father,” when taken in connection with the contents of the paper, show that it was “signed by him”? When stated thus bluntly, — in the very language of the statute, — the answer seems free from doubt; but since we said in Brennan’s Est., <a href="/pa/244/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="244 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1003461" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0574-01">244 Pa. 574</a>, 581, that “Signing in the usual acceptation of the word and in the sense in which, presumably, it is used in the act, is the writing of a name or the affixing of what is meant as a signature,” we must go further and determine whether or not the word “Father” was “meant as a signature.”</p>

The first two requirements were derived from the English statute; the third was new, (since followed by the Act of 1 Yict. c. 26) and was the result of experience of the dangers of having mere memoranda or incomplete directions taken for the expression of final intention: Baker’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="107 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="8857855" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0381-01">107 Pa. 381</a>; Vernon v. Kirk, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20223" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="30 Pa. 223">30 Pa. 223</a>. These being the purposes of the act, and the legislature not having concerned itself with what should be deemed a signing, we must look dehors the statute for a definition. As already said, the act is founded on the statute of frauds, 29 Car. II. Under that act it has been held that the signing may be by a mark, or by initials only, or by a fictitious or assumed name, or by a name different from that by which the testator is designated in the body of the will: 1 Jarman on Wills 78; 1 Bedf. on Wills, c. 6, section 18, and cases there cited.”</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[143,1361,1152,748]]]'>This has been approved and followed in Plate’s Estate, <a href="/pa/148/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="148 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="981811" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0055-01">148 Pa. 55</a>; Swire’s Est., <a href="/pa/225/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="225 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="965252" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0188-01">225 Pa. 188</a>, 192; and Churchill’s Est., <a href="/pa/260/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="260 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1040244,1040326" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0094-01,/pa/260/0094-02">260 Pa. 94</a>, 100, and has never been doubted. If, then, the word “Father” was intended as a completed signature to this particular character of paper, it answers all the purposes of the Wills Act. That it was so intended we have no doubt. It was the method employed by decedent in signing all such letters, and was mailed by him as a finished document. In these respects it varies from Brennan’s Estate, supra, so much relied on by appellant, where the writing of “your misserable father,” was construed to be not a signature, but part of an unfinished paper, which decedent retained, and to which his signature was not subsequently attached.</p>

The same cases decide, however, it will be held to be so “if the intent to execute is apparent.” In the present case, as already pointed out, testator used the word “Father” as a full and complete signature, and mailed the paper as a finished document. True, a formal will would not be so executed; but this is not a formal will. It is a letter, signed by him in the way he executed all such letters, and from this circumstance, his “intent to execute is apparent” beyond all question.</p>
