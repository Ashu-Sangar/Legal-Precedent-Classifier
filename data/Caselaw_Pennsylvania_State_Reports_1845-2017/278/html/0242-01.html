Reciting that they had tendered a deed of reconveyance to defendant, and demanded of him a return of the purchase money and payment of damages they had suffered, complainants •asked for a decree cancelling the deed, requiring the defendant to repay to them the purchase money and to make good their damage. Defendant demurred, averring that the suit should have been brought at law. The court properly sustained the demurrer on the ground that, in substance, the bill prayed for a recovery of money for the damages sustained by plaintiffs resulting from the deceit practiced and the breach of contract by defendant, but instead of certifying the ease to the law side of the court dismissed the bill.</p>
