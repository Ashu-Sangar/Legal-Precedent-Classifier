An application for this was made through Edwards, George &amp; Company of Pittsburgh, who, in turn, communicated with O’Neill, Moltz &amp; Heavner, and its agent in New York, one Simmonds, secured the issuance of a policy numbered 7260 by the Atlas Assurance Company. This defendant is an English corporation, with representatives in the United States, and the contract was executed on its behalf, the premium being fixed at $18,994.64. The policy was given to Simmonds by the insurer, by him transmitted to his firm, which passed it to Edwards, George &amp; Company. The latter delivered it to the plaintiffs, and received the full amount of premium agreed upon. The policy was dated June 17,1921.</p>

      <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>On October 10th following, the insurance was can-celled and surrendered, and, in December, a new policy, numbered 103, for a less amount, was issued, and sent directly to Edwards, George &amp; Company, or through the other agents referred to, and delivered to plaintiffs. Under the terms of both agreements, provision was made for the return of any unearned premium, in the event of termination of the contract by defendant. When the liability on 7260 was ended, the sum collectible as such was $11,788.56, and the amount to be paid by the insured, under the terms of 103, was $10,325.73, leaving an apparent balance in favor of plaintiffs of $1,462.83, if credit was taken, and given, as alleged. Notice of cancellation of the second policy was transmitted in writing on February 20,1922, and, at that time, the unearned premium on it was $6,536.13.</p>

U. S. Fashion Plate Co., <a href="/pa/269/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="269 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1063486" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0428-01">269 Pa. 428</a>; Franklin S. R.

Here, we find an admission of the execution of the policies, handing of them to the agents, the delivery to plaintiffs, who paid the consideration named, the respective cancellations, and the amount of unearned premiums then accrued. As to policy 103, there is the statement that the writing passed directly from defendant to Edwards, George &amp; Co., which’ <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>transmitted it to the insured, but this difference we regard as immaterial.</p>

Whether, as averred, the parties through whose hands the policies passed, are to be treated as brokers or agents, is clearly of this character. The denial of the receipt of the premium by the defendant company is made, but not a failure to pay the sum to the agent who had the policy for transmission, and who delivered it. The statement that the satisfaction of the consideration named in the second policy was not by way of crediting the amount against the unearned accruals on the first, then due to insured, is an inference sought to be drawn from the contradiction of an actual payment to it. If there was such a balance owing, the plaintiffs could so appropriate it; and, we may note, policy 103 was sent to the agent for delivery without restriction, and, by its terms, the defendant agreed to insure, in “consideration of the stipulations herein named, and of $10,325.73 premium.”</p>

It substituted a new contract for the first, and the obligation of the insured was limited to any excess above the amount due them, and, in this case, they were the creditors. A somewhat similar situation was presented in Arnfeld <em>&amp; </em>Sons v. Assurance Company, <a href="/pa/172/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="172 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="874066,874104" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0605-01,/pa/172/0605-02">172 Pa. 605</a>, where the contract was cancelled by notice to a broker, and a new policy, for a like amount, taken out by him in another company.

In the present instance, both policies were issued by the same company, and the balance due plaintiffs would, in the ordinary course of business, be appropriated, as far as necessary, to the new indebtedness incurred. Certainly, it does not appear that instructions were given not to deliver, unless further payment was made.</p>

There is no effective denial that the full amount of the first premium was paid to Edwards, George &amp; Co., to whom the policy had been sent for delivery, and that it remitted to the next agent in line, but it is insisted no liability attached to the insurer, without actual receipt of the consideration. The general rule applicable in such cases has been thus stated: “Payment to insurer’s agent, authorized or having apparent authority to receive the premium, is equivalent to payment to insurer; and the policy has its inception from the instant such payment is made. And it is no defense to the company that the agent has not remitted at all.....,If the insurer has intrusted the policy to its agent for delivery to the insured, and the latter, in reliance thereon, has paid the premium to such agent, the insurer cannot be heard to say that such agent has not authority to collect”: 26 C.

Though distinguishable on its facts, subsequent declarations by this court weaken its authority. Justice Dean, in referring to it, in Arthurholt v. Fire Ins. Co., supra, p. 9, said, in part: “It ought to be held that, under a clause [requiring the receipt of payment by the company], the insurers themselves waive it, whenever, by their voluntary act, the policy leaves the office to be delivered to the insured on payment of the premium; and this without regard to the fact that someone, having no nominal connection with the company as agent, hands over the policy and receives the premium. By the very fact of issuing a policy which requires, apparently, nothing but delivery and payment of premium to put it in force, the company arms every man into whose hands it may come with the power to receive its money; there could be no conduct more significant of an intention to waive the advantage of such a clause than this.”</p>
