    <p class="summary" id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[152,667,1150,1732]]]'>The case was submitted to the jury with instructions that though indebted, a man may make provision for his wife by a voluntary conveyance of land, if, nevertheless, he retains sufficient property in his hands from which his creditors, by suit and execution, could compel payment, if necessary, unless such voluntary conveyance were a part of an actual scheme to defraud his creditors. Later on in his charge the trial judge used this language: “The idea is simply this, gentlemen. That that principle of law is intended to prevent fraud. And a conveyance which has no tendency to defraud anybody is good. If it was intended to defraud the creditors which a man had at the time, or if its tendency was to do it, so as to keep them out of their money, or hinder or delay them, why then it would be void. ... ... On the other hand there is testimony here given by himself, Mr. Mitchell, that he had been endeavoring for a long time to get a settlement with Hyndman &amp; Garney; that they kept his pass book and would not let him have <em>it; </em>and that such was the condition of things, as I remember his testimony, at the time this deed was made. The question might arise in your minds, could he have had the purpose in his mind that a settlement might be in their favor, result in their favor and against him, and that he would try and hinder them from getting their money by putting the property in his wife’s name?......If you believe that he made this deed to his wife in order to hinder and delay creditors which he had at the time he made the deed, including Hyndman &amp; Garney, then your verdict should be for the defendant, because in that case the deed would be void under the statute.”</p>

And it not being shown that there were any subsequent creditors at all, and it being perfectly apparent that the firm of Hyndman &amp; Garney was an existing and not a subsequent creditor and that the question was distinctly submitted to the jury whether the conveyance to the wife tended to hinder, delay or defraud that particular firm, we do not think that, though the instructions were not so full and complete, perhaps, as they should have been were the rights of subsequent creditors in question, nevertheless they were correct with reference to existing creditors to which class Hyndman &amp; Garney belonged, and could not have injured the defendant who claimed under that firm.</p>
