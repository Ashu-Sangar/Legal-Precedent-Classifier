Colket, is the owner of about five acres of land in Lower Merion township Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, situate on the northeast side of Morris avenue, near Bryn Mawr. This property was conveyed to him by Frederick A. Dreer, et al., trustees under the will of Ferdinand J. Dreer, his deed bearing date 26th May, 1905. On the land thus acquired Mr. Colket has built a house, in which he resides with his family, consisting Of his wife and several small children.

Verner, is the owner <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>of about six and two-thirds acres of land situate on the northeast side; of Morris avenue, to the southeast of the plaintiff’s land which it adjoins. This property was conveyed to her on 27th April, 1904, by her husband, the defendant, Harry J. Verner, who acquired title to it by deed dated 17th September, 1898, from Edward F. Beale et ux. Upon this tract a house has been built, which at the time of the filing of the bill was occupied by the defendants as a residence. The defendants have constructed and maintain a fish pond on the northwest side of their property, at no great distance from the plaintiff’s land.</p>

A small brook which rises in the lawn of Mr. Wayne MacVeagh and flows into Mill Creek, runs in a southerly direction across both properties, passing first through the Colket tract. By this stream, whose natural bed in few places exceeded eighteen inches in width, and whose depth was rarely greater than three inches, both of the ponds above referred to are supplied with water. The plaintiff’s pond was constructed by widening and slightly deepening the original bed of the stream and throwing a dam across it. The defendants’ pond was constructed by making an excavation in the earth to the east of the stream, from which the water necessary to fill and replenish it is conveyed to it by means of an underground pipe. This pond was constructed in 1904 or 1905.</p>

In order to raise the level of the stream to a height sufficient to make it possible to draw from it a supply of water for their pond, the defendants have built a dam across the brook at a point about thirty-five feet southeast of the plaintiff’s line. The effect of this has been to back up the water over the plaintiff’s land as far as tb.e dam maintained by him, and to increase the depth of that portion of the stream between his dam and the fence that separates the two properties about twenty-two inches. The result of this deepening <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>of the water has been to make the stream overflow the bed that it originally occupied, and fill the entire space between the two sides of the gully through which it formerly meandered, so that now between the party line and Mr. Colket’s dam the stream is from ten to twelve feet wide and a little more than two feet deep.] .</p>

Verner, built a dam across the stream near the point where the dam of which the plaintiff complains now stands. This was not as high as the present dam, and did not back up the water of the stream over what is now the plaintiff’s land. Into the pond thus formed large quantities of earth, &amp;c., were brought down from the lands higher up the stream whenever freshets occurred. On a number of occasions, in order to maintain his pond, Mr. Verner was obliged to clean it out and cart away the earth removed from it. After this had continued for several years he caused a stone wall to be built across the stream at his boundary line in order to catch and hold the earth and debris brought down by the water, and thus prevented the filling up of the pond. The wall was of riprap — that is, it was made of stones laid <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>without mortar or cement. This structure was several times washed away, but was rebuilt each time in the same manner. The flow of the water was not interfered with by the riprap just mentioned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[149,593,1152,1252]]]'>7. Later, in 1901 or 1905, when the defendants’ present pond was constructed, their original dam, the dam built by Mr. Yerner in 1898, was abandoned, and the riprap work at the point where the stream crossed their boundary line was replaced by a concrete wall. This held back the water, and, to a certain extent, flooded the land above it. From the water thus dammed up the Verners drew the supply for their new pond by means of a pipe. These arrangements were made a short time prior to the purchase by Mr. Colket of the adjoining property. The land now owned by the plaintiff was then part of a tract occupied by a family named Schalliol, who, upon condition that they would keep the buildings and fences in repair and pay the insurance premium and the taxes upon it, had the right, under the will of their uncle, Ferdinand J. Dreer, its former owner, to live upon it rent free until it should be sold by the trustees, who were by Mr. Dreer’s will vested with the power to dispose of it. To the backing up of the water by the defendants over the land that they occupied the Schalliols made no objection, but it does not appear that either they or the trustees under Ferdinand J. Dreer’s will ever formally consented thereto.</p>

After the plaintiff acquired title to the land formerly occupied by the Schalliols, he protested to Mr. Verner against the backing up of the water of the stream over his property by the dam maintained on the boundary by the defendants. Negotiations ensued, which ended in the plaintiff’s giving consent that this dam should remain until he called for its removal. The terms of the arrangement entered into between the parties are set out in a memorandum- signed by Mr. Yerner. This reads as follows:</p>

They in no wise interfered with the flow of the water. After several attempts by the defendants to obtain a supply of water for their pond through pipes either from the bed of the brook or from the plaintiff’s pond had failed, in order to provide such water supply they built the dam of which the plaintiff now complains.</p>
