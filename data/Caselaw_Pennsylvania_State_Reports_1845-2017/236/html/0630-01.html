Testimony was submitted, Mr. Billman claiming the stock under an alleged arrangement with the widow, and the widow testified that she understood that the stock was to belong to the estate. The court below found the transaction a fraud upon the widow and children, and adjudged the shares of stock to belong to the estate. The court further proceeded to ascertain the profits .which the corporation had made from the 12th day of November, 1904, to January 1,1910, the amount thereof being $171,144.02.

In other words, without haying before it the Ferdinand Goetz Sons’ Company, the court below found that the balance of its net profits during the period stated, after paying the purchase price of the interest of Ferdinand Winter in the partnership, amounted to $90,644.02, and decreed that of this sum W. C. Billman, the business manager of the corporation, should receive $18,428.80 as the balance due him for services to the corporation, and that the remainder of the said net profits should be paid to the widow. This anomalous adjudication was made because the court found that the estate of the testator was the owner of 1,494 of the 1,500 shares of the capital stock of the Ferdinand Goetz Sons’ Company, or six shares less than the entire stock issue. Suppose the estate was the owner of all the stock, what the court below did would be none the less anomalous. The estate, as a holder of all the stock, would not be the owner of the corporation, but only of the shares of its capital stock, which constitute a species of property entirely distinct from the corporate property. A shareholder has no distinct and individual title to the moneys or property of the corporation, nor any actual control over it: Bidwell v. Pittsburgh, Oakland &amp; East Liberty Passenger Railway Company, <a href="/pa/114/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="114 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="550060" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0535-01">114 Pa. 535</a>. “We have been referred to no authority, and we know of none, that asserts the doctrine that the purchaser of all the shares of the capital stock of a corporation thereby becomes the owner of its property. On the contrary the principle is well established that the shares of the capital stock of a corporation are essentially distinct and different from the corporate property, and that the owner of all the stock of a corporation does not own the corporate property or become entitled to manage or control it. ‘A corporation,’ says Mr. Cook in his work on Corporations, Section 6, ‘is an entity, an existence, irrespective of the persons who own all its stock. The fact that one person owns all of the stock does not <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>make him and the corporation one and the same person.’ In Morawetz on Private Corporations, Sec. 1009, it is said that ‘it is well settled that all the shares in a corporation may be held by a single person, and yet the corporation continues to exist; and if the charter or bylaws should require certain acts to be done by more than one shareholder, the sole owner may transfer a portion of his shares to other persons, so as to conform to the letter of the rule.’ In Bidwell v. Pittsburgh, Etc., Pass. Railway Company, <a href="/pa/114/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="550060" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0535-01">114 Pa. 535</a>, Mr. Justice Clark, delivering the opinion of the court, says: ‘The shares in a corporation constitute a species of property entirely distinct from the corporate property; a shareholder has no distinct and individual title to the moneys or property of the corporation, nor any actual control over it; the shares represent a right to participate in profits only’”: Mr. Justice Mestrezat, in Monongahela Bridge Company v. Pittsburgh &amp; Birmingham Traction Company, <a href="/pa/196/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="196 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="916762" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0025-01">196 Pa. 25</a>.</p>

Billman, the business manager of the corporation, for his services, and ordered that out of the profits he should be paid the sum of $18,428.80, in addition to what he had already received. All this was coram non judice. The common law was ignored, as were the express words of the act of May 14, 1891, P.
