In 1906 the entire street railway system of the city of Reading, made up of a number of lines belonging to independent companies, was, under leases executed by them to the United Traction Co., operated as a whole by the latter, including a line on Front and certain other streets belonging to the Front &amp; Fifth Street Railway Co., and another on Schuylkill avenue belonging to the Reading City Passenger Railway Co.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b230-3" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[332,676,1146,537]]]'>3. In response to this the city was by Dr. Walter A. Rigg advised, not only that the cause of complaint would, as far as practicable, be abated, but that it might be entirely removed and at the same time the convenience of the traveling public greatly enhanced by the construction, with the city’s permission, of a track connecting the two lines of railway above mentioned along and upon two intervening blocks of Windsor street, the two lines thus connected forming a so-called “loop.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[332,1224,1150,1235]]]'>4. This suggestion being reported to the City Councils, the matter was referred to the Railway Committee for consideration. Between it and Dr. Rigg as representing the railway companies interested there were various consultations and communications, — among the latter a letter from Dr. Rigg to the chairman of the committee, dated Oct. 6, 1906, and written upon the letter-head of the United Traction Co., in which, in the event of the grant of permission to construct the “loop,” it was stated (1) that the turn-out should be removed, (2) that there should be “no increase of fare,” and (3) that the “fare limit” should be Buttonwood street, a single fare carrying a passenger from any part of town to any point on Schuylkill avenue or around the “loop” to Front and Buttonwood streets, and as to incoming passengers a single fare being good from Schuylkill avenue and Buttonwood street and points beyond, around the “loop” to any part of the city, — the fare charged at the time by the United Traction Co. for a single trip on any part of its system being 5 cents or a ticket obtainable at the option of passengers by purchase from the conductors on the cars in strips of 6 tickets costing 25 cents.</p>

The committee on Oct. 7, 1906, largely actuated by the letter just adverted to, reported to councils upon the matter referred to it as one between the city and the United Traction Co., recommending the grant of permission to make the connection suggested as above detailed and the passage of an ordinance for that purpose. Accompanying the report was the draft of an ordinance handed to the committee by Dr. Bigg, and so drawn as to grant the privilege in question to the Front &amp; Fifth Street Bailway Co., it having been explained to the committee by Dr. Bigg that the United Traction Co. was an operating and not a constructing company, and that therefore the grant must be made to the former. The ordinance was in due course passed with the addition of certain provisions, among which was that embodied in Sec. 2 thereof, viz, “That the rate of fare shall not exceed five (5) cents for a single fare, or six tickets for twenty-five (25) cents,” — and as passed was approved Dec. 8,1906.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-3" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[168,1444,1152,702]]]'>6. Within a few days thereafter the Front &amp; Fifth Street Bailway Co. filed in the office of the city clerk its formal acceptance, required by the ordinance, of the same and “all the conditions thereof.” Thereupon the connecting line was constructed -and at once passed under the control and operation of the United Traction Co. The stipulations contained in the letter of Oct. 6, 1906, relative to the removal of the turn-out on Schuylkill avenue, the fare limit and the fare itself were carried out, the United Traction Co. accepting for a single fare from Schuylkill avenue and Buttonwood street around the “loop” to any part of the city 5 cents in cash or one of 6 tickets sold in strips for 25 cents.</p>

About March 18, 1910, tbe United Traction Co. discontinued tbe sale of strip tickets over its entire system, collecting a straight 5 cent fare from passengers, tbe fare limit above mentioned remaining unchanged. On March 21, 1910, tbe mayor of tbe city addressed to the president of said company a letter calling bis attention to tbe alleged duty of tbe company to sell strip tickets over its entire system, requesting compliance therewith, and advising him of tbe city's purpose in tbe contrary event to institute proceedings to compel it. Tbe answer of tbe president of tbe company to this letter, dated tbe same day, denied tbe existence of tbe duty on tbe basis of Dr. Rigg's letter of Oct. 6, 1906.

In so holding we said that nothing in the letter from Dr. Rigg to the chairman of the railways committee of the city councils “nor in the ordinance can be construed into an agreement by the United Traction Company to continue the general sale of strip tickets, and its right was, <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>and the right of the Reading Transit Company, its successor, is, to charge a fare of five cents for every passenger riding on its lines, except as it may be committed by the ordinance of December 8,1906, to continue to sell six tickets for twenty-five cents, good to or from points on the Schuylkill avenue and Front and Fifth street railway lines. That question, however is not to be passed upon until it is properly raised.” The question which we declined to consider in that case, because it was not before us, was properly raised -in this proceeding, and, in passing upon it, the learned chancellor below regarded it, as we intended it to be regarded, if raised, as an open one.

That ordinance provides that “the rate of fare shall not exceed five (5) cents for a single fare, or six tickets for twenty-five (25) cents.” These words certainly mean something; but in their breach of good faith with the city of Reading, those in control of the affairs of the Reading Transit Company now assert that they mean nothing. The ordinance related to the Front and Fifth Street and Schuylkill Avenue lines. At the time it was passed the rate of fare on these lines was five cents, or a passenger, at his option, could purchase six tickets for twenty-five cents, each of which gave to him the same transportation rights and privileges as were given by paying a five-cent fare. The negotiations between Dr. Rigg and the chairman of the street railways committee of councils which led to the passage of the ordinance related to the two lines just mentioned, and it is trifling with judicial patience to contend that both parties so negotiating did not under<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>stand and intend that, upon the completion of the loop, the mode of paying a fare should remain unchanged on the two lines and should continue to give a passenger the same transportation rights. The ordinance passed, in pursuance of these negotiations became a contract between the city and the two lines and their lessee, and a fare paid on either line by a passenger with one of six tickets issued to him, at his option, as provided by the ordinance,'entitles him to the same transportation as if he had paid a cash fare of five cents. No other conclusion could have been reached by the learned president judge below under the undisputed facts in the case, and the decree is affirmed at appellants’ costs.</p>
