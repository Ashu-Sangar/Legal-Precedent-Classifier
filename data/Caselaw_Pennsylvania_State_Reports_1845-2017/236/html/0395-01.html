L. 230, which provides, in Section 4: “Every bill shall be read at length in each branch; no bill shall become a law upon the same day on which it was introduced or reported”; and the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, for the government of second class cities, Section 4, “No ordinance or resolution shall be passed finally on the day of its introduction, except in case of public emergency, and then only when requested by the city recorder and approved by the affirmative votes of all the members of councils.”</p>

It did not become a law until signed by the mayor which was two months after it was introduced in council, and four days after it was reported out of <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>committee. The provision of the Act of 1901 does not affect this ordinance, because it was not passed finally on the day of its introduction. It was introduced into councils, February 14, and was not passed finally until April 11th. It is true, it was passed finally the day it was transmitted from common to select council; but the act of assembly only prohibits the passage of the ordinance finally on the day of its introduction. The difference between the Act of 1901, governing second class cities, and the act governing third class cities, is significant. The latter act provides “no bill shall be passed finally in either branch upon the same day upon which it was introduced or reported.” The legislature provided a difference, and a very significant difference, in the acts governing the two different classes of cities.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[316,1205,1148,524]]]'>It appears that, after the final passage of this ordinance by select council, a copy of the ordinance was made, which was signed by the clerk of select council and transmitted to the mayor for his approval. It is objected by the counsel for petitioners, that the ordinance is void, because it is not signed by the presidents of council, nor by the clerk of. common council; and the Act of April 6, 1867, P.

The Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, is an act for the government of second class cities, and provides a complete system of government for those cities; and, in our opinion, repeals the special acts for the city of Pittsburgh which are inconsistent with it. But, even if the acts of 1867 and 1868 are in force, the acts of the presiding officers are purely ministerial. The requirement that they shall sign the ordinances was not essential to the validity of the ordinance. The Act of June 20,1901, P. L. 586, relating to cities of the second class, provides: “Every ordinance or resolution shall, before it takes effect, be presented, duly engrossed, <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>and certified, to the city recorder, for Ms approval. The city recorder shall sign if he approves.” The city recorder is now the mayor of the city of Pittsburgh. This was done in this case. To engross an ordinance means to make a copy of it. A copy of this ordinance was made and certified by the clerk of select council and transmitted to the mayor. It is not intended that the original paper which was introduced, with all its amendments and interlineations, should be sent in that condition to the mayor for his approval; but'that the ordinance, as finally passed, should be engrossed and sent to the mayor. That was done in this case, and the mayor approved it. There is no requirement in the Act of 1901, or in the Act of January 7,1874, P. L. 477, that the clerks of both branches shall sign the ordinance; but that the ordinance shall be properly certified. And the one to certify that ordinance is the clerk of that branch which passed the ordinance finally.</p>

The repeal of the ordinance opening Black street is to annul all proceedings had by virtue of that ordinance. It restores the parties to the same position which they occupied before the ordinance for the opening of Black street was passed. It is an annulment of the proceedings to open Black street. The vacation of a street affirms all the proceedings for the establishment of that street. It accepts the street as a public highway, and begins proceedings to vacate.</p>

If it had intended that this proceeding should be a vacation, it would have called it a vacation, and provided for the proceedings, as in case of other vacations; It is evidently intended that, if the city discovers that it is not good policy to proceed with the improvements undertaken, before the final confirmation of the viewers’ report, it may repeal the ordinance or discontinue the proceedings taken, without liability to pay any damages which have been assessed. It will be observed that the ordinance must be repealed, or the proceedings discontinued, within thirty days after the filing of the report of the viewers. That means, before final confirmation of the viewers’ report. There is no restriction on the jurisdiction of council to take these proceedings only on the petition of abutting property owners. At the time of the passage of this act, the act empowering councils to pass ordinances for improvements and for vacation of streets by a three-fourths vote, was not the law.</p>

    <p id="b434-7" data-blocks='[["BL_434.8",434,[319,814,1149,689]]]'>The ordinance assailed by the appellants is not for the vacation of Black street. It merely repeals the ordinance of July 13, 1908, directing the opening of that street, which for many years had been a located, but unopened, highway of the city of Pittsburgh on what was known as the “East Liberty Plan.” The ordinance of April 15, 1910, repealing the opening ordinance, was passed in pursuance of the provisions of the Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, and all of the objections to the validity of its passage are clearly and correctly answered in the opinion of the learned judge of the court below refusing to vacate the order quashing the proceedings before the board of viewers.</p>

Negley, deceased, because, at the time it was passed, the city had entered upon that property and treated Black street as one of its highways, involves a question of fact which the court below found adversely to the appellants. The finding is as follows: “In the improvement, the grading and curbing and paving of streets, which cross the line of the located Black street, turnouts were made in the paved streets at places where they crossed the located Black street. But on none of these streets did the city go beyond the line of the cross street which it was improving. It could not be said to have entered upon Black street, because, although there is a turnout which indicated that there was or was to be a street at each of these places yet the entire improvement at this place was within the line of <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the several cross streets which it was improving at the time. It would be an undue stretching of the situation to say that this was an entry upon Black street and treating that as a public highway by the city.” This finding has not been assigned as error, and we cannot, therefore, disturb it; but, even if it had been so assigned, we could not overrule it, for the testimony of J. S. Fullerton, called as a witness by the appellants, was sufficient to sustain it. On cross-examination, he testified as follows: “Q. Outside of Boreland street, which is shown on this plan, none of the curbs extend into the part covered by Black street? A. They extend to the property line, yes sir. Q. They don’t extend beyond the line of the cross streets which are shown upon the plan? A. No, sir; the location is within a tenth or so. Q. At the end of Boreland street you say the curb is extended into Black street? A. Yes, sir. Q. And that is the only one of these streets where the street improvements extend to any extent whatsoever upon the property covered by what is known as Black street? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
