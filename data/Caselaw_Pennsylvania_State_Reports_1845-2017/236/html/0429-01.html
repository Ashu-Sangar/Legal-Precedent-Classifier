The right to an issue, under the facts shown, was considered by this court on an appeal by the same appellant, in a proceeding that grew out of the application by the administrator for an order to sell the real estate of the decedent for the payment of debts. In dismissing the appeal it was said, “The issue asked for was not of right but depended upon the discretion of the court under the facts as developed: Kates’s Estate, <a href="/pa/148/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="148 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="981748" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0471-01">148 Pa. 471</a>. . There was not only no abuse of this discretion but in our judgment, upon a review of the whole record, a proper exercise of it.” See Ike’s Estate, <a href="/pa/200/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="200 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="924302" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0202-01">200 Pa. 202</a>.
