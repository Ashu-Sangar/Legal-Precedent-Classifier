L. 135. It was agreed, inter alia, that “The plaintiff served as stenographer before masters appointed in divorce cases and before a referee on application for a charter, as directed by the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, No. 5, of Philadelphia County, as set forth in exhibit A (the exhibit being attached and stating the details of the charges in a number of specified cases), and furnished accurate typewritten copies of his notes of testimony to the said masters and referee, which copies were duly filed of record. In all the said suits.....there was an absence of agreement between the parties or. their counsel as to the compensation that should be paid the official stenographer, and he has not received any compensation therefor. The court thereupon approved the plaintiff’s bill for services in the said..... <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>cases and directed that the same be paid by the county of Philadelphia at the rate of fifteen cents per hundred words, as provided for in Section 8 of said act.” The defendant refused payment, questioning the authority of the Court of Common Pleas to incur the expense or order the payment. Judgment was given for the plaintiff and affirmed by the Superior Court.</p>

The correctness of notes of testimony upon which courts base their decisions in divorce and charter cases is a matter of vital public importance. “The statute (Act of May 1, 1907, supra) has general reference to public judicial proceedings ____ The public generally ____ have an interest in the prompt, efficient and certain administration of justice.....It is, therefore, to the interest of all the people that every proper safeguard should be provided to guard against mistakes in the administration of justice”: Clift v.

The act having conferred authority upon the Courts of Common Pleas to order payment for services of the character performed by the plaintiff, judgment in his favor was properly rendered below and sustained by the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b595-6" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[123,1364,1151,88]]]'>The assignments were overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
