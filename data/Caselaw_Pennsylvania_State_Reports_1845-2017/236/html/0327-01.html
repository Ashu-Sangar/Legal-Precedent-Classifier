The Act of 1911 establishes school districts based upon population, and this is the method of classification long recognized in the law of our State. Such classification has been supported when applied to cities, counties and townships, and we can conceive of no reason why it should not be sustained when applied to school districts. In Sugar Notch Boro., supra p. 357, we said, “There is no constitutional objection to the classification of school districts any more than of cities. Both are included in the same clause of the constitution prohibitory of local and special legislation, and there is no argument against classification of one that is not equally forcible against the other....... Classification may become as necessary for school districts as for cities. The needs and capabilities of school districts may differ as substantially, if not as widely as those of cities. They differ in the number and authority of the school officers, the extent and mode of assessing and collecting school taxes, etc. It would be a most unfortunate clog on the improvement of our school system if Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Allegheny and other cities could not have their high schools.... or even their kindergartens, without the necessity of imposing the expense of a similar establishment on every borough and sparsely populated township in the State”; and in Com. v. Gilligan, <a href="/pa/195/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="195 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="914028" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0504-01">supra p. 511</a>, “Recognizing that a large population compressed into a small territory may have the same necessity for a somewhat differently constituted board of government for the business affairs of its schools, that it has for its strictly <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>municipal affairs, it (the act under consideration) provides a special system for districts so specially situated. This is the legitimate office of classification, and therefore is not local or special within the prohibition of the constitution.......Whether the variations as to the boards of direction or control are wise is a legislative not a judicial question.” Also see Com. v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/203/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="203 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="994770" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0209-01">203 Pa. 209</a>, and Erie School District v.

Since in enacting the code the legislature founded the distinction in school districts upon population, the standard repeatedly approved by this court, it would be an unwarranted exercise of power to set aside the classification or declare the act unconstitutional by reason thereof. The cases already cited show that we have been most liberal in our view concerning the right to classify school districts, and this certainly is not an occasion when we should depart from that attitude. As the statute is drawn, to set aside the classification would destroy the structure of the act and require us to declare it void as a whole. We must assume that the distinction in districts was deemed essential to the school system intended to be developed by the code, and there is no evidence contained in the act which justifies a judicial finding that the classification was adopted for other than legitimate <em>purposes; </em>every classification, ex necessitate, recognizes the requirement for differences in legislation; hence, none can be condemned by merely pointing to such differences. It may be that some of the details of the present act will prove invalid, for it would be difficult to draw such an elaborate piece of legislation and avoid this possibility, but none has been called to our attention the striking down of which would disturb the scheme of classification or nullify the statute. In Stevenson v. Henderson, <a href="/pa/234/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="234 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="982526" data-case-paths="/pa/234/0478-01">234 Pa. 478</a>, the only ease thus far decided under the School Code, we sustained the validity of a levy of the occupation tax therein provided for, against the contention that it was invalid because of undue classification. <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>We conclude that the objection to the classification is not well taken.</p>

If there are provisions not covered by the title, they do not affect the validity of the act as a whole unless they are vital in character and it is apparent that without them the lawmakers would not have enacted the legislation; we are not convinced that any of the matters called to our attention by the appellant can be thus classed. The code is entitled, “An act to establish a public school system, etc.”; this is a most comprehensive expression, not restricted to or conveying the idea of a mere codification of existing laws, and thereunder the general assembly has, in accordance with the constitutional mandate, provided for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools.</p>

But heed surely ought to be given to their contention that, under the guise of a general classification of the districts, the Act of 1911 produces, and was passed for the undoubted purpose of producing, local and special results. It constitutes the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh districts of the first class; it makes the directors in. those districts ap<a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>pointive; it provides that districts of the second, third and fourth classes shall collect an occupation tax on all male citizens over twenty-one years of age of at least $1.00; it provides that in districts of the first class certain workmen only may be employed on school buildings, and attempts to regulate the wages which shall be paid to them; it prohibits directors in districts of the first class from using cut stone in school buildings unless the same shall be prepared in the district; and it gives to the electors outside the districts of the first class the right to elect school directors, but denies this franchise to the citizens of the school districts of the first class. The legislature has, in effect, said to the people of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that while citizens in other districts of the state may be trusted to manage their school affairs, they cannot be so trusted. It is difficult to conceive of legislation more local and special in its character, making this uncalled-for distinction between the citizens of the two leading municipalities of the State and those of all other localities. “It is not only local and special, but odious in its discrimination”: Davis v.

It ■ is special legislation under the attempted disguise of a general law. Of all forms of special legislation this is the most vicious.” When the act was passed, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were the only two cities which could have become, under it, school districts of the first class, and how can it possibly be doubted that the legislature intended to legislate specially for them when it provided, inter alia, that the people in those two cities should not vote for school directors; that the directors in those districts should be limited, in building and furnishing schoolhouses, to the employment of certain kinds of labor at certain rates, which they had no voice in establishing; that no cut stone could be used in the erection of a school building in a district of the first class, unless prepared in a stone yard in the district; that in all other parts of the state voters could choose their school directors; that the directors in other districts could build schoolhouses out of any material they might see fit to use, without regard to where it came from, and that the male citizens in all classes of districts except the first should be compelled to pay at least $1.00 of an occupation tax, from which the male citizens of the first class districts were exempt. No conceivable ground of necessity justified these startling discriminations, which must be read as local or special legislation, intended as such, and, therefore, coming within the clear prohibition of the constitution, unless there is to be expunged from it that clause which declares that the general assembly shall not pass any local or special law “regulating the management of public schools, the building or repairing of schoolhouses, and the raising of money for such purposes.” The majority of the court concede that some of the provisions of the Act of 1911, relating to school districts of the first <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>class, “may well be condemned as local legislation,”' because they cover matters “in no conceivable way peculiar to sucb districts as distinguished from other districts.” What is there so peculiar to the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that their people ought not to have the same right that is given to the people in all other parts of the state — to elect their own school directors?</p>

It is an exception as old as the rule itself; has its origin in the same causes; and is justified by the same governmental reasons. The local municipalities are, viewed in one aspect, the agents of the state for the purposes of local government; viewed in another aspect they are the local legislature, directly representative of and responsible to the people of their respective territories. The principle that taxation can only be by consent of the people to be taxed, acting through their representatives authorizes taxation by local authorities for local purposes, and discountenances interference in such matters by the representatives of other portions of the State. Long settled usage confirms this reasoning; and it is a firmly established doctrine that the power of local taxation for local purposes may be exercised by municipalities. In authorizing the local governmental bodies to exercise the power, the legislature may be regarded in theory, not really <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>as delegating the power (for it is a power which belongs to the locality rather than to the government at large) but as laying down a general rule for the exercise, by the municipalities, of the power which belongs to them”: Gray, Limitations of Taxing Power, 281. “There is, nevertheless, one clearly defined exception to the rule, that the legislature shall not delegate any portion of its authority. The exception, however, is strictly in harmony with the general features of our political system, and it rests upon an implication of popular assent, which is conclusive. The exception relates to the case of municipal corporations”: Cooley on Tax., (2d Ed.), 63. Such corporations are considered parts of the machinery of the government, governmental agencies, necessary and most effective to manage the local affairs of the people residing in the designated locality, and, by custom immemorial, a portion of the political powers of the State has been delegated to them, to be exercised in local administration. But school directors are not municipal officers. They are not invested with any of the municipal powers, nor are they charged with the performance of municipal functions: Chalfant v.

They are not even to be appointed by the legislature, but are to be appointees of the judges of the courts of common pleas, who, strictly speaking, are not the representatives of the people.

The people are not to be taxed except by their own consent or that of officers truly representing them: Keasy v. Bricker, <a href="/pa/60/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="60 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1014484" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0009-01">60 Pa. 9</a>. “From the very dawn of our liberties the principle most unquestionable of all has been this: that the people shall vote the taxes they are to pay, or be permitted to choose representatives for the purpose.” Cooley, J., in Detroit Board of Park Commissioners v.

Of all the powers of government the one most liable to abuse is the power of taxation. If placed in hands irresponsible to the people of the district to be taxed, its abuse is a mere question of time”: Parks v. Wyandotte County Board of Com’s, 61 Fed. Repr. 436.</p>

Eberly, <a href="/ala/82/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="82 Ala. 242" data-case-ids="3322948" data-case-paths="/ala/82/0242-01">82 Ala. 242</a>, the question before the court was the constitutionality of an act of the legislature investing trustees appointed by the act, <em>eo nomine, </em>and their successors, to be appointed by the state superintendent of education, with the power to levy taxes for school purposes, and, in holding that the act could not be upheld, it was said: “It is useless to waste discussion to show that the ‘Cullman school district’ is not a municipal corporation. Speaking of such districts as corporate bodies, Judge Dillon says: ‘Considered with respect to the limited number of their corporate powers, the bodies above named rank low down in the scale or grade of corporate existence; and <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>hence have been frequently termed quasi corporations. This designation distinguishes them, on the one hand, from corporations aggregate, and on the other, from municipal corporations proper, such as cities or towns acting under charters, or incorporating statutes, and which are invested with more functions and a larger amount of corporate life.’ 1 Dillon Munc. Corp., Sec. 25; Heller v. Stremmel, <a href="/mo/52/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="52 Mo. 309" data-case-ids="972144" data-case-paths="/mo/52/0309-01">52 Mo. 309</a>. The people have no voice in the selection of the trustees, nor in the management and control of the public schools, the building of school houses, or any of the local affairs of the district. The first trustees are appointed <em>eo nomine, </em>in the act, and their successors by the state superintendent of education. They are clothed with all the executive powers pertaining to the purposes of the corporation, and are vested with the highest attribute of legislative power, to levy and collect a tax. Exclusive of the trustees, the corporation has no function; it does not possess what has been said to be the distinguishing feature of a municipal corporation proper, the power of local government in a corporate capacity; and the cardinal principle of self-taxation is ignored. It has no features in harmony with our system of republican government. However earnest may be the interest in popular education, and however great may be the desire to contribute to its spread and advancement, we cannot afford, in order to accomplish an end so benevolent and beneficial to break down the constitutional safeguards of property, which the sovereign people have ordained for their protection. If the authority of the legislature to delegate the power to tax to the trustees of this district is upheld, the constitutional limitations upon the power of the general assembly, counties and municipal corporations, are vain and delusive. Similar corporations, to an indefinite number, may be created, covering the entire territorial area and population of the state — subordinate agencies despotic <em>sub modo, </em>being governed by trustees of legislative appointment with power to impose <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>a tax on the people, to whom they are under no official accountability, who have clothed them with no authority, and who are appointed without the consent of those who are to pay the tax, directly or indirectly expressed. If this can be done for educational purposes, it may be done for any other public purpose. Such legislation, first induced by a patriotic desire to secure the great desideratum of popular education, calculated to lull vigilance, may become misgovernment, subversive of the fundamental and distinguishing principles of republican institutions.” In the comparatively recent case of Vallelly, et al., v. Board of Park Commissioners (Supreme Court North Dakota), 111 N. W. Repr. 615, an act of the legislature authorized a board appointed by the city council, without the consent of the people, to levy general taxes. In declaring it unconstitutional, the court said in part: “It has become a well-recognized principle of constitutional law that local boards and councils elected by the people are bodies to which the power to tax may be delegated. This is so upon the principle that the legislative power to levy taxes rests with the people; and, so long as the people have a voice in the selection of bodies to which the power to tax is delegated, the constitutional restriction is not violated. The power of the legislature to delegate the authority to levy taxes is generally held to be limited to boards or councils elected by the people, and is not sanctioned when delegated to those appointed, when the appointment has not been assented to by a vote of the people. This limitation is recognized under the principle that all powers of taxation are reposed in the people, and, unless the people assent by vote to the appointment or election of the taxing authorities, the law authorizing such powers of taxation to those not thus assented to is repugnant to the Constitution, and not to be upheld. The power to levy taxes is one of the most important of legislative functions. If abused, it may amount to a practical confiscation of property. A power so far-<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>reaching should not be reposed in any one not directly responsible to the people. If appointed by the people, and abuses follow, a remedy by removal is in their hands; otherwise, redress is so remote as to be without practical results. Regardless of Section 180, of the Constitution, the delegation of the taxing power to a person or board without some assent by the people could not be sustained. The power to tax is a legislative power and cannot be delegated to boards or commissions whose appointment has not been in some way assented to by the people.”</p>

It has not, as it might have, fixed definitely the rate of taxation in those districts but has delegated to boards to be appointed by the judiciary an absolute discretion and power to tax within certain limits, and the people who are to be taxed by such boards have no voice as to what the rate of taxation shall be. While a minimum below which and a maximum above which these appointed boards cannot go have been designated in the act, the authority to fix the rate of tax between the designated limits has been delegated to the boards and can be exercised according to their arbitrary discretion. Until they determine the rate of taxation to be levied within the districts for which they are appointed, no one in those communities can determine from the Act of 1911 what the tax is or will be. Until the boards act, the rate of tax is an unknown quantity. Indeed, until they do act, there, is no tax provided, for an undetermined tax is no tax in law. The determination of the amount or rate of a tax to be imposed is as essential in the exercise of taxing power as the designation of the property to be taxed, or the time for its collection or enforcement: State v. Ashbrook, <a href="/mo/154/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="154 Mo. 375" data-case-ids="967959" data-case-paths="/mo/154/0375-01">154 Mo. 375</a>.
