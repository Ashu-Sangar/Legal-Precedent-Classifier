On Sugar Creek the Great Lakes Coal Company opened a coal mine called the Snow Hill mine, built a tipple and thereon conveyed the coal to the Western Allegheny Railroad, the trains of which run through the Sugar Creek valley. A large amount of refuse or gob was taken from the mouth of the mine, and dumped at its entrance. On Pine Run another entry was made, called the Pine Run mine, from which a tramway was^ <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>constructed down Pine Run to Sugar Creek, where the coal was also loaded on the cars of the Allegheny &amp; Western Railroad, and the refuse was taken from the mine and dumped along the eastern side of the hill This dump encroached upon a public road that occupied the eastern side of the Pine Run valley and upon a small stream that flowed down it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[331,1250,1148,1135]]]'>We think it would have been justifiable to have taken the case from the jury for want of any relevant evidence as to the true measure of damages. As to the eleven acres of mineral limestone covered by the gob pile, no attempt was made to prove its market value, but R. H. Wilson, an expert witness on part of the plaintiff testified that each acre, in round numbers contained about 50,000 tons of limestone, worth ten cents per ton, thus making the damages $55,000. This was the method pursued in computing the value of mineral limestone in the case of Reading &amp; Pottsville R. R. Co. v. Balthaser, <a href="/pa/119/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="119 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="558115" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0472-01">119 Pa. 472</a>. In regard to it, the Supreme Court said, “It is almost unnecessary to argue the incompetency of that kind of testimony. Its character and effect was fully pointed out in the opinion of this court in the case of Searle v. L. &amp; B. R. Co., <a href="/pa/33/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="33 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="988396" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0057-01">33 Pa. 57</a>. We there held that the value of the land as coal land could be allowed, but not the value of the coal itself underneath the road. We do not measure the value of the land by such facts. Land may have $4,000 worth of coal per acre in it and yet sell at $40.00 per acre.”</p>

The testimony showed that the plaintiff owned 4,000 acres of land and that the outcropping of limestone extended six miles. If one acre was worth $5,000, the 4,000 acres would be worth $20,000,000. Or if covering the outcrop for 1,600 feet damages the plaintiff $55,000, if the entire outcrop had been covered it would damage him $2,000,000. The figures show the danger of expert testimony.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b533-3" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[121,1048,1152,482]]]'>The testimony showed that the gob carried from the mine had covered a few small hemlock shrubbery, growing on the hillside, and had partly closed a small private road that might cause a tenant of plaintiff to drive a small distance out of his way. The measure of damages in such cases is pointed out in Bobb v. Carnegie, <a href="/pa/145/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="825917" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0324-01">145 Pa. 324</a>, and Chase v.

If Mr. Dewey had insisted that a clause should be put in his agreement that the gob should not be deposited on his property, would he have been able to sell his coal? Or if that was his understanding of the contract, why did he stand by for years and allow,this large pile of refuse to be deposited upon his land? The only answer can be that he well knew, both from the express and implied conditions of his agreement, that his grantee had the right to deposit the gob at the pit mouth.</p>
