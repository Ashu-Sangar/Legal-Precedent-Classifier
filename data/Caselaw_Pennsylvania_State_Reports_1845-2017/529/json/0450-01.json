        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe issue before the Court is whether the trial court\u2019s admission of expert testimony concerning the so called \u201cchild sexual abuse syndrome\u201d was error mandating a new trial. For the reasons set forth in Commonwealth v. Dunkle, 529 Pa. 168, 602 A.2d 830 (1992), we hold that the admission of such testimony was error and that a new trial is required.\nThe appellee, Richard Sees, was charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, and incest involving a sexual assault upon his son, who was seven years old at the time of the incident. According to the testimony at trial, the child victim became withdrawn, started having nightmares and wanted to accompany his mother any time she left the home. When interviewed by a child protective service worker, the child appeared nervous and distraught. The child\u2019s babysitter testified that in June, 1986, the child told her that he had been abused by his father, was frightened and did not want to be in his father\u2019s presence.\nThrough cross-examination by the appellee, it was established that there was a lengthy delay in reporting the allegations of abuse and that such allegations only began when a custody battle was initiated between the victim\u2019s mother and father.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth called an expert, Susan Slade, to testify about behaviors exhibited by sexually abused children as well as reasons why sexually abused children do not always report the abuse immediately after the incident.\nThe appellee was convicted of indecent assault and found not guilty of all other offenses. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the conviction, 402 Pa.Super. 658, 578 A.2d 40, holding that it was error to allow the expert witness to testify. We affirm that decision on the basis of our opinion in Commonwealth v. Dunkle, where we held that it was error to permit an expert to testify about behaviors allegedly exhibited by sexually abused children. In Dunkle, we also held that it was error to permit an expert to testify as to why children who have suffered sexual abuse may delay reporting the incident. Thus, for the reasons set forth in Dunkle, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court remanding the case for a new trial.\nAffirmed.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\nMcDERMOTT, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant also claims that Appellee waived the issue of whether the Appellant\u2019s expert should have been entitled to testify about the sexually abused child syndrome. Immediately after the testimony of the Appellant\u2019s expert, defense counsel moved that the testimony be stricken, since \"[you] can\u2019t come in with very general information in every case and lay it out in front of the Jury with nothing else and that\u2019s what happened here.\u201d (N.T. 288). During the colloquy with the Court, the trial judge stated \"[yjour objection is on the record and if you\u2019re right, it\u2019s something you\u2019re protected on the record, I note again like some of the other issues this is a cutting edge issue----\u201d The trial judge also noted that there was some confusion as to the state of the law in this area, referring to Commonwealth v. Baldwin, 348 Pa.Super. 368, 502 A.2d 253 (1985), appeal denied; Commonwealth v. Pearsall, 368 Pa.Super. 327, 534 A.2d 106 (1987), appeal denied, 524 Pa. 596, 568 A.2d 1246 (1989); and Commonwealth v. Davis, 518 Pa. 77, 541 A.2d 315 (1988).\nIt is admittedly difficult to discern precisely the nature of the objection raised by defense counsel. In his post trial opinion, the trial judge notes that \"[t]here does appear to be inconsistency in the Defendant\u2019s argument post-verdict with his request during the trial.\" Nevertheless, the trial court and the Superior Court (in its memorandum opinion) both addressed the issue. In light of their respective decisions to address the substance of the issue and to foreclose any possibility of an ineffectiveness claim in a Post-Conviction Relief Act petition (which would most certainly follow, were we to find the issue waived), we too will address the merits of the case.",
