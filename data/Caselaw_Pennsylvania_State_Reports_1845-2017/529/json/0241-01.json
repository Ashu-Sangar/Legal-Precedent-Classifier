        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis case involves the question of whether the conduct of Appellee-attorneys is actionable independent of any violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. While we agree that violations of the Code do not per se give rise to legal actions that may be brought by clients or other private parties, we, nevertheless, conclude that the record supports a finding that Appellees\u2019 conduct here constituted a breach of common law fiduciary duty owed to Appellant-clients and that, contrary to Appellees\u2019 argument that they cannot be prevented from representing a former client\u2019s competitors, the injunction issued by the trial court against Appellees should have been sustained by the Superior Court. As a result, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court, as more fully explained below.\nAppellants, plaintiffs in the trial court and appellees in the Superior Court, are Maritrans GP Inc., Maritrans Partners L.P. and Maritrans Operating Partners L.P. (hereinafter, collectively, \u201cMaritrans\u201d). Appellees, defendants in the trial court and appellants in the Superior Court, are the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz (hereinafter \u201cPepper\u201d), and one of Pepper\u2019s partners, J. Anthony Messina, Jr. (hereinafter \u201cMessina\u201d). In February, 1988, Maritrans brought an action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as for compensatory and punitive damages, against Pepper and Messina, its former attorneys of more than ten years. Maritrans\u2019 action arises out of Pepper and Messina\u2019s representation of Maritrans\u2019 competitors, entities whose interests were found to be adverse to the interests of Maritrans, in matters substantially related to matters in which they had represented Maritrans.\nOn May 1, 1989, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County entered an order preliminarily enjoining Pepper and Messina from continuing to act as labor counsel for seven of Maritrans\u2019 New York-based competitors, with the exception of one discrete piece of litigation then scheduled to commence on May 8, 1989. The trial court ruled that preliminary injunctive relief was necessary given the existence of a substantial relationship (i.e., a conflict of interest in derogation of Pepper and Messina\u2019s fiduciary duties to Maritrans) between Pepper and Messina\u2019s current representation of the New York companies, whose interests were adverse to the interests of Maritrans, and their former longstanding representation of Maritrans. Pepper and Messina then moved in the trial court for a stay pending appeal, and certain of the New York competitors moved for leave to intervene in the action. Both motions were denied.\nPepper and Messina then appealed the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order to the Superior Court which issued a judgment and opinion (Wieand, J. concurring in the result) reversing the preliminary injunction order. Maritrans\u2019 subsequent applications for a stay or an order restoring the preliminary injunction pending appeal were denied first by two of the members of the Superior Court panel which decided the case (Wieand, J. not participating in the decision), and then by Chief Justice Nix, Jr., acting as a single justice, and not on behalf of the Court, pursuant to Rule 123 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa. R.A.P. 123(e). The matter is now on full appeal to this Court. For the reasons explained below, we reverse.\nThe facts taken in a light most favorable to Maritrans, the winner at the trial court level, are as follows: Maritrans is a Philadelphia-based public company in the business of transporting petroleum products along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States by tug and barge. Maritrans competes in the marine transportation business with other tug and/or barge companies, including a number of companies based in New York. Pepper is an old and established Philadelphia law firm. Pepper and Messina represented Maritrans or its predecessor companies in the broadest range of labor relations matters for well over a decade. In addition, Pepper represented Maritrans in a complex public offering of securities, a private offering of $115 million in debt, a conveyance of all assets, and a negotiation and implementation of a working capital line of credit. Over the course of the representation, Pepper was paid approximately $1 million for its labor representation of Maritrans and, in the last year of the representation, approximately $1 million for its corporate and securities representation of Maritrans.\nDuring the course of their labor representation of Mari-trans, Pepper and Messina became \u201cintimately familiar with Maritrans\u2019 operations\u201d and \u201cgained detailed financial and business information, including Maritrans\u2019 financial goals and projections, labor cost/savings, crew costs and operating costs.\u201d Trial court opinion, 4/21/89, at pp. 7-8. This information was discussed with Pepper\u2019s labor attorneys, and particularly with Messina, for the purpose of developing Maritrans\u2019 labor goals and strategies. In addition, during the course of preparing Maritrans\u2019 public offering, Pepper was furnished with substantial confidential commercial information in Maritrans\u2019 possession \u2014 financial and otherwise \u2014 including projected labor costs, projected debt coverage and projected revenues through the year 1994, and projected rates through the year 1990. Pepper and Messina, during the course of their decade-long representation of Maritrans, came to know the complete inner-workings of the company along with Maritrans\u2019 long-term objectives, and competitive strategies in a number of areas including the area of labor costs, a particularly sensitive area in terms of effective competition. In furtherance of its ultimate goal of obtaining more business than does its competition, including the New York-based companies, Maritrans analyzed each of its competitors with Pepper and Messina. These analyses included an evaluation of each competitor\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and of how Maritrans deals with its competitors.\nArmed with this information, Pepper and Messina subsequently undertook to represent several of Maritrans\u2019 New York-based competitors. Indeed, Pepper and Messina undertook to represent the New York companies in their labor negotiations, albeit with a different union, during which the New York companies sought wage and benefit reductions in order to compete more effectively with, i.e., to win business away from, Maritrans.\nIn September, 1987, Maritrans learned from sources outside of Pepper that Pepper and Messina were representing four of its New York-based competitors in their labor relations matters. Maritrans objected to these representations, and voiced those objections to many Pepper attorneys, including Mr. Messina. Pepper and Messina took the position that this was a \u201cbusiness conflict,\u201d not a \u201clegal conflict,\u201d and that they had no fiduciary or ethical duty to Maritrans that would prohibit these representations.\nTo prevent Pepper and Messina from taking on the representation of any other competitors, especially its largest competitor, Bouchard Transportation Company, Maritrans agreed to an arrangement proposed by Pepper whereby Pepper would continue as Maritrans\u2019 counsel but would not represent any more than the four New York companies it was then already representing. In addition, Messina \u2014 the Pepper attorney with the most knowledge about Mari-trans \u2014 was to act not as counsel for Maritrans but, rather, as counsel for the New York companies, while two other Pepper labor attorneys would act as counsel for Maritrans; the attorneys on one side of this \u201cChinese Wall\u201d would not discuss their respective representations with the attorneys on the other side. Maritrans represented that it agreed to this arrangement because it believed that this was the only way to keep Pepper and Messina from representing yet more of its competitors, especially Bouchard.\nUnbeknownst to Maritrans, however, Messina then \u201cparked\u201d Bouchard and another of the competitors, Eklof, with Mr. Vincent Pentima, a labor attorney then at another law firm, at the same time that Messina was negotiating with Pentima for Pentima\u2019s admission into the partnership at Pepper. Moreover, notwithstanding Pepper\u2019s specific agreement not to represent these other companies, Messina for all intents and purposes was representing Bouchard and Eklof, as he was conducting joint negotiating sessions for those companies and his other four New York clients. On November 5, 1987, Maritrans executives discussed with Pepper attorneys, inter alia, Maritrans\u2019 plans and strategies of an aggressive nature in the event of a strike against the New York companies. Less than one month later, on December 2, 1987, Pepper terminated its representation of Maritrans in all matters. Later that month, on December 23, 1987, Pepper undertook the representation of the New York companies. Then, on January 4, 1988, Mr. Pentima joined Pepper as a partner and brought with him, as clients, Bouchard and Eklof. In February, 1988, Maritrans filed a complaint in the trial court against Pepper and Messina.\nDiscovery procedures produced evidence as follows: (i) testimony by principals of the New York companies to the effect that the type of information that Pepper and Messina possess about Maritrans is of the type considered to be confidential commercial information in the industry and that they would not reveal that information about their companies to their competitors; (ii) testimony by principals of the New York companies that they were desirous of obtaining Maritrans\u2019 confidential commercial information; (iii) testimony by principals of the New York companies that labor costs are the one item that make or break a company\u2019s competitive posture; (iv) an affidavit from the United States Department of Labor attesting that, contrary to defendant Messina\u2019s sworn testimony at the first preliminary hearing in February, 1988, Maritrans\u2019 labor contracts are not on file with the Department of Labor and thus not available under the Freedom of Information Act; and other information as well.\nAfter initially denying the preliminary injunction, the trial court delivered a bench opinion in which it was stated that the court had sua sponte reconsidered its decision not to enter injunctive relief against Pepper and Messina. The trial court specifically noted that by denying Maritrans\u2019 request for preliminary injunctive relief the week before\u2014 even in the face of various breaches of Pepper and Messina\u2019s fiduciary duties to Maritrans \u2014 it had not \u201cfully accounted] for the special relationship between attorney and client ...\u201d but, rather, had inappropriately treated the case as a \u201ccommercial dispute involving ordinary business interests.\u201d Upon further reflection and after re-reviewing the voluminous record in this case, the trial court determined that preliminary injunctive relief was both justified and appropriate. See, Trial Court Opinion, 4/26/89, at pp. 5-8, 5-17.\nIn reconsidering sua sponte the initial decision not to enjoin Pepper and Messina, the trial court held that by initially focusing on only the November 5, 1987, meeting between Pepper attorneys and the Maritrans executives\u2014 and not on Pepper and Messina\u2019s entire representation of Maritrans \u2014 the court had taken too restrictive a view of the test to determine whether attorneys have breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in former-client conflicts of interest, i.e., the substantial relationship test. The trial court went on to hold that a substantial relationship exists between Pepper and Messina\u2019s former representation of Maritrans and their current representation of the competitors, entities whose interests are materially adverse to the interests of Maritrans in the current representation. The trial court also found that Pepper breached its obligation, which was fortified by a specific promise, to keep from Messina that which was learned after the erection of the \u201cChinese wall.\u201d Concluding that Maritrans was entitled to be able to proceed in its business with confidence that its plans and strategies would not be disclosed or used by Appellees, even inadvertently, the trial court ruled that preliminary injunctive relief was warranted given the existence of material adversity between Maritrans and the New York competitors, of a substantial relationship between the representations, and the fact that Maritrans had carried its burden in proving the necessity for a preliminary injunction.\nThe Superior Court reversed stating that the trial court erred by issuing a preliminary injunction based upon Pepper\u2019s alleged violation of the [Pennsylvania] Rules of Professional Conduct without making any independent finding that Pepper\u2019s conduct was actionable. The Superior Court found that the trial court\u2019s use of Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7 and 1.9 as points of reference for its breach of fiduciary duty analysis improperly augmented the substantive law of our Commonwealth. The Superior Court did not analyze whether the common law principles of fiduciary duty, embodied in those rules, nonetheless apply to this case. The Superior Court then held that an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest in representing a subsequent client whose interests are materially adverse to a prior client in a substantially related matter is not \u201cactionable\u201d in Pennsylvania. As already noted, we reverse.\nThe public\u2019s trust in the legal profession undoubtedly would be undermined if this Court does not correct the Superior Court\u2019s failure to recognize the common law foundation for the principle that an attorney\u2019s representation of a subsequent client whose interests are materially adverse to a former client in a matter substantially related to matters in which he represented the former client constitutes an impermissible conflict of interest actionable at law. The Superior Court\u2019s decision is diametrically opposed to law established by the courts of this Commonwealth and throughout the United States which have imposed civil liability on attorneys for breaches of their fiduciary duties by engaging in conflicts of interest, notwithstanding the existence of professional rules under which the attorneys also could be disciplined.\nI.\nActionability and Independent Fiduciary Duty at Common Law of Avoiding Conflicts of Interest \u2014 Injunctive Relief\nA preliminary injunction is a harsh remedy for which \u201cessential prerequisites\u201d must be proven. See, e.g., Public Utility Commission v. Process Gas Consumers Group, 502 Pa. 545, 467 A.2d 805 (1983). These are:\n1) The Petitioner makes a strong showing that he is likely to prevail on the merits.\n2) The Petitioner has shown that without the requested relief, he will suffer irreparable injury.\n3) The issuance of a stay will not substantially harm other interested parties in the proceedings.\n4) The issuance of a stay will not adversely affect the public interest.\n502 Pa. at 552-553, 467 A.2d 805.\nIn John G. Bryant, Inc. v. Sling Testing & Repair, Inc., 471 Pa. 1, 6-7, 369 A.2d 1164, 1166-67 (1977), we declared it \u201cessential\u201d that the \u201cactivity sought to be restrained is actionable.\u201d See also, Singzon v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Public Welfare, 496 Pa. 8, 11, 436 A.2d 125, 127 (1981); Albee Homes, Inc. v. Caddie Homes, Inc., 417 Pa. 177, 181, 207 A.2d 768, 770 (1965).\nActivity is actionable if it constitutes breach of a duty imposed by statute or by common law. Our common law imposes on attorneys the status of fiduciaries vis a vis their clients; that is, attorneys are bound, at law, to perform their fiduciary duties properly. Failure to so perform gives rise to a cause of action. It is \u201cactionable.\u201d Threatened failure to so perform gives rise to a request for injunctive relief to prevent the breach of duty.\nAt common law, an attorney owes a fiduciary duty to his client; such duty demands undivided loyalty and prohibits the attorney from engaging in conflicts of interest, and breach of such duty is actionable. See, e.g., Stockton v. Ford, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 232, 13 L.Ed. 676 (1850); Woods v. City Nat\u2019l. Bank & Trust Co., 312 U.S. 262, 61 S.Ct. 493, 85 L.Ed. 820 (1941); T.C. Theatre Corp. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 113 F.Supp. 265 (S.D.N.Y.1953). The Superior Court here emasculated these common law principles, in effect turning the ethical or disciplinary rules governing lawyers into a grant of civil immunity for conduct which has been condemned from time immemorial. As stated by the United States Supreme Court in 1850:\nThere are few of the business relations of life involving a higher trust and confidence than those of attorney and client or, generally speaking, one more honorably and faithfully discharged; few more anxiously guarded by the law, or governed by sterner principles of morality and justice; and it is the duty of the court to administer them in a corresponding spirit, and to be watchful and industrious, to see that confidence thus reposed shall not be used to the detriment or prejudice of the rights of the party bestowing it.\nStockton v. Ford, 52 U.S. (11 How.) at 247. By ignoring the common law principles of fiduciary duty, the Superior Court elevated attorneys above the law and granted to them greater rights and protection than are enjoyed by any other fiduciaries in this Commonwealth. No rule so preferring attorneys can be permitted to stand. See also, American Dredging Co. v. City of Philadelphia, 480 Pa. 177 at 185, 389 A.2d 568 at 572 (1978); Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg, 216 Cal. App.3d 1139 at 1150, 265 Cal.Rptr. 330 at 335 (1989). Adherence to those fiduciary duties ensures that clients will feel secure that everything they discuss with counsel will be kept in confidence. Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., 83 N.J. 460, 416 A.2d 852 (1980). Pepper and Messina, as attorneys, had a duty to administer properly their responsibilities to respect the confidences of Maritrans. See, e.g., American Dredging, supra, 480 Pa. at 185, 389 A.2d at 572; Slater v. Rimar, Inc., 462 Pa. 138 at 145, 338 A.2d 584 at 587 (1975); Realeo Servs., Inc. v. Holt, 479 F.Supp. 867, 875 (E.D.Pa.1979); David Welch Co. v. Erskine & Tulley, 203 Cal.App.3d 884, 890, 250 Cal.Rptr. 339, 342 (1988).\nOur courts clearly have the power to enjoin an attorney from breaching his duty to a client:\nWhile the breach by a lawyer of his duty to keep the confidences of his client and to avoid representing conflicting interests may be the subject of appropriate disciplinary action, a court is not bound to await such development before acting to restrain improper conduct where it is disclosed in a case pending in that court.\nSlater v. Rimar, Inc., supra, 462 Pa. at 148-49, 338 A.2d at 589 (footnote omitted). The power to enjoin the threatened violation of an attorney\u2019s fiduciary duty not to engage in conflicting representations dates at least to the early 1900\u2019s:\n180. Restraining Attorney from Acting Adversely to Client\nWhere an attorney so far forgets, or ignores, his professional duty as to engage his service to one whose interests are necessarily in conflict with those of his client, or in whose employment he will be in a position to take undue advantage of the confidential communications of such client, there is no doubt of the power of the court to enter and enforce an order restraining the attorney from so acting____\n1 Thornton on Attorneys at Law (1914). Moreover, \u201c[a] court may restrain conduct which it feels may develop into a breach of ethics; it \u2018is not bound to sit back and wait for a probability to ripen into a certainty.\u2019 \u201d United States v. RMI Co., 467 F.Supp. 915, 923 (W.D.Pa.1979) (citation omitted). The courts do not have to wait until the derelict attorney appears before it.\nAccordingly, the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction was a proper mechanism to abate an unlawful and actionable breach of fiduciary duties to Maritrans where the facts support such a conclusion.\nII.\nAn Attorney\u2019s Common Law Duty is Independent of the Ethics Rules\nContrary to the arguments raised by Pepper and Messina, we conclude that the Superior Court badly confused the relationship between duties under the rules of ethics and legal rules that create actionable liability apart from the rules of ethics. The Superior Court correctly recognized that simply because a lawyer\u2019s conduct may violate the rules of ethics does not mean that the conduct is actionable, in damages or for injunctive relief. The court was also correct in saying that the trial court\u2019s finding of violation of the ethical rules concerning misuse of a client\u2019s confidences is not as such a basis for issuing an injunction. These propositions are correct under either the Code of Professional Responsibility or the Rules of Professional Conduct.\nHowever, the Superior Court then stood this correct analysis on its head. That court held that the trial judge\u2019s reference to violations of the rules of ethics somehow negated or precluded the existence of a breach of legal duty by the Pepper firm to its former client. The court also held that the presumption of misuse of a former client\u2019s confidences, developed in the law of disqualification, is inapplicable because the present case involves an injunction. Both of these propositions involve serious confusion in the law governing lawyers.\nLong before the Code of Professional Responsibility was adopted, and before the Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted, the common law recognized that a lawyer could not undertake a representation adverse to a former client in a matter \u201csubstantially related\u201d to that in which the lawyer previously had served the client. The universally recognized statement of this rule of law is Consolidated Theatres, Inc. v. Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corp., 216 F.2d 920 (2d Cir.1954). The Consolidated Theatres decision relied importantly on T.C. Theatre Corp. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., supra. Both of these cases relied on decisions of now more than 50 years standing such as United States v. Bishop, 90 F.2d 65 (6th Cir.1937); and Gesellschaft Fur Drahtlose Telegraphie v. Brown, 78 F.2d 410 (D.C.App.1935).\nAll of these decisions were rendered before there was a Code of Professional Responsibility. None was a disciplinary case. Consolidated Theatres and United States v. Bishop involved disqualification, which is a civil proceeding involving legal responsibilities and legal and equitable remedies. A motion for disqualification is simply an injunctive order issued in a case already pending. The Gesellschaft Telegraphie case involved misuse of confidences as an equitable defense to an action by an attorney to collect a fee.\nThe legal obligation of a lawyer to refrain from misuse of a client\u2019s confidences goes even further back, predating the ABA Canons of Professional Ethics promulgated in 1908. See, e.g., Bowman v. Bowman, 153 Ind. 498, 55 N.E. 422 (1899), which was also a disqualification case. The threatened violation of this duty thus has been recognized as the basis for an injunction for at least virtually a century, as stated in the leading treatise on attorneys of about the same vintage. See, 1 Thornton on Attorneys at Law, \u00a7 180 (1914), quoted above.\nThe Superior Court seems to have the idea that because conduct is not a tort simply because it is a disciplinary violation, then conduct ceases to be a tort when it is at the same time a disciplinary violation. This is an inversion of logic and legal policy and misunderstands the history of the disciplinary rules. The Superior Court\u2019s decision contradicts the logic of this Court\u2019s decision in Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin and Creskoff v. Epstein, 482 Pa. 416, 393 A.2d 1175 (1978), and in Rizzo v. Haines, 520 Pa. 484, 555 A.2d 58 (1989). Adler in particular has direct application here. That case involved lawyer misconduct that violated the ethical rule against solicitation and the legal rule against misuse of confidential employer information. Since misuse of a law firm\u2019s confidences is actionable while also being an ethical violation, surely misuse of a client\u2019s confidences can be actionable while also being an ethical violation. As regards misuse of a former client\u2019s confidences, the disciplinary rules derive from the lawyer\u2019s common law duties, not the other way around.\nIII.\nScope of Duties at Common Law\nWe next must discuss the scope or the contours of remedy for an attorney\u2019s breach of duty to his or her client at common law. Attorneys have always been held civilly liable for engaging in conduct violative of their fiduciary duties to clients, despite the existence of professional rules under which the attorneys could also have been disciplined.\nCourts throughout the country have ordered the disgorgement of fees paid or the forfeiture of fees owed to attorneys who have breached their fiduciary duties to their clients by engaging in impermissible conflicts of interests. See, e.g., White v. Roundtree Trans., Inc., 386 So.2d 1287 (Fla.App.1980); Perl v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 345 N.W.2d 209 (Minn.1984); Rice v. Perl, 320 N.W.2d 407 (Minn.1982); Financial Gen. Bankshares, Inc. v. Metzger, 523 F.Supp. 744 (D.D.C.1981), vacated on jurisdictional grounds, 680 F.2d 768 (D.C.Cir.1982); Goldstein v. Lees, 46 Cal.App.3d 614, 120 Cal.Rptr. 253 (1975); Zeiden v. Oliphant, 54 N.Y.S.2d 27 (Sup.Ct.1945).\nNotwithstanding that the attorneys in those cases could have been disciplined under applicable rules of professional conduct, disgorgement or forfeiture of fees for services rendered were ordered. Likewise, the United States Supreme Court has said:\nA fiduciary ... may not perfect his claim to compensation by insisting that although he had conflicting interests, he served his several masters equally well or that his primary loyalty was not weakened by the pull of his secondary one. Only strict adherence to these equitable principles can keep the standard of conduct for fiduciaries \u201cat a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\u201d\nWoods v. City Nat\u2019l. Bank & Trust Co., supra, at 312 U.S. at 269, 61 S.Ct. at 497 (quoting Justice Cardozo).\nCourts have also allowed civil actions for damages for an attorney\u2019s breach of his fiduciary duties by engaging in conflicts of interest. See, e.g., Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg, supra, (permitting suit for a constructive trust and damages by a real estate partnership against a law firm that breached its fiduciary duty to the partnership by usurping a partnership opportunity); David Welch Co. v. Erskine & Tulley, supra, (where the court affirmed a judgment of $350,000 against a law firm that breached its fiduciary duties toward a former client after being privy to the former client\u2019s confidential information by, inter alia, failing to inform the former client that the law firm prepared business proposals designed to undercut the former client\u2019s business relationships).\nCourts throughout the United States have not hesitated to impose civil sanctions upon attorneys who breach their fiduciary duties to their clients, which sanctions have been imposed separately and apart from professional discipline. What must be decided in this case is whether, under the instant facts, an injunction lies to prohibit a potential conflict of interest from resulting in harm to Appellant Mari-trans. Resort to simple equitable principles, as applied to the facts of this case, renders an affirmative answer to this question.\nIV.\nEquity\nInjunctive relief will lie where there is no adequate remedy at law. Fox-Morris Associates, Inc. v. Conroy, 460 Pa. 290 at 294, 333 A.2d 732 at 734 (1975) (Roberts, J. concurring). The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo as it exists or previously existed before the acts complained of, thereby preventing irreparable injury or gross injustice. Slott v. Plastic Fabricators, Inc., 402 Pa. 433, 167 A.2d 306 (1961). A preliminary injunction should issue only where there is urgent necessity to avoid injury which cannot be compensated for by damages. Independent State Store Union v. Pa. Liquor Control Bd., 495 Pa. 145, 432 A.2d 1375 (1981). The court which is to exercise discretion in the matter of issuance of an injunction is the trial court and not the appellate court and the action of the trial court may be reviewed on appeal only in the case of a clear abuse of discretion but not otherwise. Rick v. Cramp, 357 Pa. 83, 53 A.2d 84 (1947).\nPepper and Messina argue that a preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion where it restrains them from representing a former client\u2019s competitors, in order to supply the former client with a \u201csense of security\u201d that they will not reveal confidences to those competitors where there has been no revelation or threat of revelations up to that point. We disagree. Whether a fiduciary can later represent competitors or whether a law firm can later represent competitors of its former client is a matter that must be decided from case to case and depends on a number of factors. One factor is the extent to which the fiduciary was involved in its former client\u2019s affairs. The greater the involvement, the greater the danger that confidences (where such exist) will be revealed. Here, Pepper and Messina\u2019s involvement was extensive as was their knowledge of sensitive information provided to them by Mari-trans. We do not wish to establish a blanket rule that a law firm may not later represent the economic competitor of a former client in matters in which the former client is not also a party to a law suit. But situations may well exist where the danger of revelation of the confidences of a former client is so great that injunctive relief is warranted. This is one of those situations. There is a substantial relationship here between Pepper and Messina\u2019s former representation of Maritrans and their current representation of Maritrans\u2019 competitors such that the injunctive relief granted here was justified. It might be theoretically possible to argue that Pepper and Messina should merely be enjoined from revealing the confidential material they have acquired from Maritrans but such an injunction would be difficult, if not impossible, to administer. On this point, see, Lubin v. Lubin, 302 P.2d 49, 144 Cal.App.2d 781 (1956). As fiduciaries, Pepper and Messina can be fully enjoined from representing Maritrans\u2019 competitors as that would create too great a danger that Maritrans\u2019 confidential relationship with Pepper and Messina would be breached.\nHere, the trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion. On these facts, it was perfectly reasonable to con-elude that Maritrans\u2019 competitive position could be irreparably injured if Pepper and Messina continued to represent their competitors and that Maritrans\u2019 remedy at law, that is their right to later seek damages, would be difficult if not impossible to sustain because of difficult problems of proof, particularly problems related to piercing what would later become a confidential relationship between their competitors and those competitors\u2019 attorneys (Pepper and Messina). The trial court already had to struggle with the problem of confidentiality in this regard. See, Trial Court opinion, 4/26/89, at pp. 9-12. In short, equitable principles establish that injunctive relief here was just and proper. Damages might later be obtained for breach of fiduciary duties and a confidential relationship, but that remedy would be inadequate to correct the harm that could be prevented by injunctive relief, at least until the court could examine the case in greater detail.\nConclusion\nIn reversing the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction, the Superior Court ignored the fact that there already exists in this Commonwealth a well-entrenched body of substantive law prohibiting fiduciaries from engaging in conflicts of interest, and that there is no law excepting attorneys from that prohibition. The Superior Court therefore erroneously concluded that the trial court had augmented the substantive law of this Commonwealth.\nFirst, in Pennsylvania, as it is throughout the United States, the relationship between the attorney and his client is a fiduciary relationship. See, above. Second, \"the concept of \u2018fiduciary relation\u2019 by definition does not permit conflicts of interest.\u201d This prohibition extends to attorneys. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 394 comment d. Accord, Slater v. Rimar, Inc., supra. Finally, a fiduciary who breaches his duty of loyalty to his principal is liable to his principle, and an injunction is a proper remedy for the breach. See above, and see, Carl A. Colteryahn Dairy, Inc. v. Schneider Dairy, 415 Pa. 276 at 279, 203 A.2d 469 at 471 (1964) (where we held that even absent a restrictive covenant, a former employer can enjoin the competitive use of confidential information obtained as a result of the trust and confidence of a former employment); Hagy v. Premier Mfg. Corp., 404 Pa. 330 at 337, 172 A.2d 283 at 287-88 (1961) (where we expressed the principle that a former employer is entitled to equitable protection against competitive use of information acquired by former employees in positions of trust); Dozor Agency, Inc. v. Rosenberg, 403 Pa. 237, 239, 169 A.2d 771, 772 (1961) (same). See also, Boyd v. Cooper, 269 Pa.Superior Ct. 594 at 597, 410 A.2d 860 at 861 (1979) (where the court held that a fiduciary may be enjoined from use of information acquired in a confidential relationship in addition to being liable for damages resulting from breach of fiduciary duty); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 394 comment e (liabilities) and 399 (\u201cA principal whose agent has violated or threatens to violate his duties has an appropriate remedy for such violation. Such remedy may be ... (f) an action for an injunction\") (emphasis added).\nObviously, there are some disciplinary rules, such as Rule 3.3 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct (Candor Toward the Tribunal), which, if violated, may not give rise to civil liability. But could it be said that an attorney who misappropriates client funds is not civilly liable to his client, and that the client\u2019s only recourse upon discovery that his attorney has misappropriated his funds is to report the attorney to the Disciplinary Board? It is obvious that this is not and cannot be the rule. Misappropriating client funds is actionable, and was actionable long before the promulgation of any rule of professional conduct prohibiting such conduct. Just as there would be an independent cause of action available to a client whose attorney has misappropriated his funds, so too there is an independent cause of action available to a client whose attorney engaged in impermissible conflicts of interest vis a vis that client. The violator is subject to civil liability as well as injunctive relief.\nAfter concluding that the trial court improperly relied upon the Rules of Professional Conduct without any independent finding that Pepper and Messina\u2019s conduct was \u201cactionable,\u201d the Superior Court asserted, without any discussion or analysis of the voluminous trial court record, that its own \u201cindependent review of the record revealed no basis upon which a preliminary injunction could have been issued.\u201d 392 Pa.Superior Ct. at 164, 572 A.2d at 743. Not only did the Superior Court err in concluding that Pepper and Messina\u2019s conduct is not actionable, as set forth above, but they ignored the substantial grounds which exist to support the trial court\u2019s decision and which we have also described above. Notwithstanding the Superior Court\u2019s cursory disposal of the issue, it is clear that substantial grounds exist to support the trial court\u2019s decision that preliminary injunctive relief was necessary to abate an actionable wrong, to prevent further and continuing irreparable harm to Maritrans, and to restore the parties to the status quo as it existed prior to the wrongful conduct, and we so find. Accordingly, the Superior Court erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the order of the Court of Common Pleas granting a preliminary injunction is reinstated. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nNIX, C.J., and FLAHERTY, J., files dissenting opinions.\n. We wish to point out for the information of the bench and bar that the memorandum opinion issued by the Chief Justice, although within his authority to do so, was incorrectly reported as the decision of the Supreme Court. Rulings of a single justice pursuant to authority of Rule 123(e) have no precedential value and do not act as the opinion of the Court as incorrectly reported.\n. The Superior court noted that the Pennsylvania Code of Professional Responsibility, and not the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, were in effect at the time Pepper began representing the New York Companies. 392 Pa.Superior Ct. 153, 572 A.2d 737, 741. However, the analysis of Pepper\u2019s conduct is the same under both Code and Rules. In any event, the disciplinary rules prohibiting attorneys from engaging in former-client conflicts of interest do nothing but reaffirm pre-existing substantive law, therefore, making it irrelevant whether the trial court was guided by the Rules rather than the Code.\n. The Tri-Growth court explained the concept of a fiduciary relationship as follows: \"A fiduciary or confidential relationship can arise when confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of others, and if the latter voluntarily accept or assume to accept the confidence, they cannot act so as to take advantage of the others\u2019 interests without their knowledge or consent. The attorney/client relationship is a fiduciary one, binding the attorney to the most conscientious fidelity.\" 216 Cal.App.3d at 1150, 265 Cal.Rptr. at 334-35 (citations omitted).\n. Section 394 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency states:\nUnless otherwise agreed, an agent is subject to a duty not to act or to agree to act during the period of his agency for persons whose interests conflict with those of the principal in matters in which the agent is employed.\nComment d to Section 394 provides in pertinent part:\nUnless an attorney makes full disclosure to his client, it is improper for him, in court proceedings or otherwise, to act for two clients whose interests conflict.",

The majority finds the creation of the relationship which harbors this risk to be a breach of Pepper\u2019s fiduciary duty to Maritrans. I believe that in reaching this result, the majority overlooks the significant body of case law that has developed in this area, as well as a key factor that renders its conclusion unreasonable.\nThe Chinese wall defense is set forth in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule l.ll. The procedure established is one whereby a single attorney or group of attorneys who has represented a particular client is isolated from another attorney or attorneys within the same firm who represent a client whose interests are substantially related but materially adverse to those of the initial client. The goal of such a procedure is to minimize the potential for the transmission of confidential information between attorneys representing clients with competing interest.\nThe Chinese wall defense is asserted in the following manner. First, in attempting to have an attorney disqualified, the former client must show that matters embraced within a pending lawsuit, in which his former attorney appears on behalf of an adversary, are substantially related to matters wherein the attorney had previously represented the former client. Comment, The Chinese Wall Defense to Law Firm Disqualification, 128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 677 (1980). Once this burden, called the \u201csubstantial relationship test,\u201d is met, and the complainant has shown that the former representation exposed the attorney to confidences or secrets arguably pertinent in the present dispute, a rebuttable presumption arises that those confidences were shared. Freeman v. Chicago Musical Instrument Co., 689 F.2d 715, 723 (7th Cir.1982); Novo Terapeutisk Laboratories v. Baxter Travenol Labs., 607 F.2d 186, 196 (7th Cir.1979).\nTo overcome this presumption, the Chinese wall defense is asserted, and the attorney and firm must demonstrate sufficient facts and circumstances of their particular case to establish the probable effectiveness of the wall. The Chinese Wall Defense, supra, at 704. The factors to be considered in the acceptance of the Chinese wall defense are the substantiality of the relationship between the attorney and the former client, Silver Chrysler Plymouth v. Chrysler Motors, 518 F.2d 751 (2d Cir.1975); the time lapse between the matters in dispute, Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Rio Algom Ltd,., 448 F.Supp. 1284, 1309-10 (N.D.Ill.1978); the size of the firm and the number of disqualified attorneys, Gas-A-Tron v. Union Oil, 534 F.2d 1322 (9th Cir.1976); the nature of the disqualified attorney\u2019s involvement, NCK Org. v. Bregman, 542 F.2d 128, 133 n. 7 (2d Cir.1976); and the timing of the wall. Relevant features of the wall itself include the following:\na. the prohibition of discussion of sensitive matters\nb. restricted circulation of sensitive documents\nc. restricted access to files\nd. strong firm policy against breach, including sanctions, physical and/or geographical separation\nABA Opinion 342, 62 ABA J. 517, 521 (1976).\nApplying these factors to the instant matter, we would be inclined initially to agree with Maritrans\u2019 assertions that the wall in this case was probably defective. Despite the size of the firm and the number of attorneys involved, the timing of the wall was delayed in relation to the existence of the conflict. The relationship between Maritrans and Pepper was substantial, as was Messina\u2019s involvement with Maritrans. Of particular significance is the fact that the conflict existed not merely within the firm as a whole but within a single attorney who sought to represent competing clients.\nThese factors reveal serious concerns which must have been patently obvious at the time the conflict arose. Nevertheless, Maritrans was informed of this peculiar arrangement and consented to it It is well-settled in the field of legal ethics that a client\u2019s consent, upon full disclosure of a conflict of interest, is sufficient to permit the attorney to continue the otherwise objectionable representation. Higdon v. Superior Court, 227 Cal.App.3d 1667, 278 Cal. Rptr. 588 (1991); Rivera v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., 1991 WL 151892, 1991 Conn.Lexis 1832 (Conn.Super.); Lansing-Delaware Water District v. Oak Lane Park, Inc., 248 Kan. 563, 808 P.2d 1369 (Kan.1991); McCarthy v. John T. Henderson, Inc., 246 NJ.Super. 225, 587 A.2d 280 (1991). See also Parker v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, 245 Kan. 580, 781 P.2d 1099 (1989); Superintendent of Insurance v. Attorney General, 558 A.2d 1197 (Me.1989). Thus, while Maritrans\u2019 concerns may have been legitimate, their initial acquiescence must be construed as a forbearance of any objections based upon the potential for breach of confidentiality. Having consented to the arrangement, they are now bound by their consent until such time as an actual breach of confidentiality occurs. As was previously found by this writer, Maritrans G.P., Inc. v. Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz, 524 Pa. 415, 573 A.2d 1001 (1990) (Memorandum Opinion), and as Maritrans implicitly concedes, Appellant\u2019s Brief at p. 58, no actual disclosure of confidential information has occurred. Maritrans\u2019 prior consent amounts to a waiver of their right to an objection based upon the fear of disclosure.\nAccordingly, I dissent.\n. The procedure set forth in Rule 1.11 ABA Model Rules of Professional Response, applies specifically to former government attorneys. But see infra note 3.\n. In Pennsylvania, the same procedure is found at Rule 1.10(a) and (b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. That Rule provides as follows:\n(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7, 1.8(c), 1.9 or 2.2.\n(b) When a lawyer becomes associated with a firm, the firm may not knowingly represent a person in the same or substantially related matter in which that lawyer, or a firm with which the lawyer was associated, had previously represented a client whose interests are materially adverse to that person and about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(b) that is material to the matter unless:\n(1) the disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and\n(2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate client to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.\n. Although the ABA opinion limits its application of the Chinese Wall to situations where the private-firm attorney\u2019s conflict exists because of prior government employment, case law indicates that the concept has wider applicability. See generally, Comment, The Chinese Wall Defense to Law Firm Disqualification, 128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 677 (1980).\n. Although Maritrans repeatedly insists that it has no way of knowing whether confidences have actually been disclosed because attorney-client privilege makes that fact difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, it does not deny conceding the absence of disclosure at the prior proceeding before this Court. Moreover, the majority in the instant appeal concedes that the concern is not that actual disclosure has occurred, but that the circumstances create significant potential for such disclosure.",
