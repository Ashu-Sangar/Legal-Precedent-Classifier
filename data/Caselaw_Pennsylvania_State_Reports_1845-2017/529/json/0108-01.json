        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nAn argument in a bar went out to the corner of 37th and Fairmount Avenue in Philadelphia. Outside the appellant pulled a gun and shot one Lamont Pollar in the back during a chase around a parked car. Lamont Pollar died. The appellant was brought to trial, pled self defense, which the jury did not accept, and was convicted of first degree murder, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. The jury\u2019s verdict, given the evidence that they heard and accepted, is beyond quarrel: by the appellant\u2019s own statement he fired the fatal shot; and the reasons he gave were contradicted by an eyewitness who saw him, in the chase around the car, fire the gun, and saw the 16 year old victim \u201cgo down.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s post-trial motions were denied and judgments of sentence were imposed. Thereafter, appellant was denied appellate relief by Superior Court and he sought our review. We now affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nThe fatal incident began with a dispute involving appellant, the sixteen year old victim, and two other undisclosed youths. The dispute took place at the Bus Stop Bar on November 9,1985. Eventually it escalated to a point where a series of shots were fired and an eyewitness observed the appellant holding a gun at the time of the shooting. The victim was subsequently found dead one block from the incident; he had a bullet wound in the back. Later that evening the appellant returned to the scene and asked the police what had transpired. They asked his name and he gave a name not his own. Still later, appellant again returned to the scene, this time in different clothing and was seen trying to open the trunk of a car which was ultimately identified as belonging to him. A police officer who staked out the scene interrupted appellant\u2019s activity and placed him under arrest. After a search warrant was obtained, the police found a gun in the appellant\u2019s trunk, later determined to be the fatal weapon.\nIn this appeal, appellant raises two issues, to wit: whether trial counsel was ineffective for pursuing a defense that utilized his prior record as a voucher for the truth of his testimony; and whether the trial court should have granted a mistrial after a Commonwealth witness made a statement regarding alleged prior criminal activity.\nIn response, the Commonwealth contends that although trial counsel\u2019s strategy involved the disclosure of the appellant\u2019s previous criminal record, this strategy was reasonable and was designed to further appellant\u2019s interests. As to appellant\u2019s second issue, the Commonwealth responds that the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury cured any possible prejudice which may have occurred by the witness\u2019 unprovoked outburst, and therefore the trial court was correct in denying appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial.\nIn addressing appellant\u2019s first issue, the test for determining whether trial counsel was ineffective is as follows:\nFirst we must determine whether the underlying claim is of arguable merit. Commonwealth v. Evans, 489 Pa. 85, 413 A.2d 1025 (1980). If the claim is devoid of merit, our inquiry ceases for counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a meritless issue. Commonwealth v. Nelson, 514 Pa. 262, 523 A.2d 728 (1987). If, however, the claim possesses merit, we must then determine whether the course of action chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. Commonwealth v. Hentosh, 520 Pa. 325, 554 A.2d 20 (1989). Finally, appellant must demonstrate how the ineffectiveness prejudiced him. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\nCommonwealth v. Tressler, 526 Pa. 139, 142, 584 A.2d 930, 931-932 (1990). Thus, the mere allegation that trial counsel pursued a wrong course of action will not make out a finding of ineffectiveness.\nAppellant\u2019s defense at trial was self defense: he contended that the victim\u2019s death occurred as a result of the scuffle in front of the bar. In order to support his self defense claim, there being no other witnesses that he could call to his aid, his own testimony was obviously necessary, and his case rested upon the jury believing he was credible. In furtherance of this approach, defense counsel, during his opening statement, stated the following:\nYou will hear from Mr. Savage, the cashier at the Super Fresh at Wynnewood and Lancaster Avenue. We will again elicit from him, and we will elicit from a number of character witnesses, including a Bishop of the church, a reverend, and some of the ladies, that for the past ten years Mr. Savage has had no criminal convictions; his wife is raising three children, et cetera. We will not attempt to hide from you that in the seventies that he had two or three convictions and got probation for certain matters. It will all come out.\nI humbly ask you to reserve your judgment. Keep an open mind until you have heard the entire case.\nAt trial, appellant testified that after the scuffle he was afraid that the three youths would return; he hid the gun in the trunk in order to prevent the youths from retrieving it; and he did not reveal his identity to the police in fear of damaging his family\u2019s reputation. Trial counsel then called character witnesses who testified as to the appellant\u2019s good reputation in the community. In response, the Commonwealth offered proof of appellant\u2019s previous convictions of attempted burglary, weapons charge and selling drugs, and cross examined appellant\u2019s witnesses about their knowledge of these prior activities. In each case the character witness indicated that these prior indiscretions did not alter their opinion of appellant.\nIt is apparent that trial counsel had to make a difficult decision. In his view appellant\u2019s prior offenses were significantly different than the pending charge and were irrelevant if the jury believed he was put to defense of his own life. Moreover, counsel could reasonably believe that appellant would appear more credible if he was truthful about his past, for such testimony had two significant benefits: first, it presented to the jury a man who was willing to be honest about a less than honorable past; and second, it gave trial counsel an opportunity to explain appellant\u2019s unusual actions immediately following the event on the basis that appellant had a justifiable fear of police contact.\nGiven all these circumstances, such a strategy was not only reasonable, but contains an old wisdom that full disclosure hides no liars. Counsel must be free to put the best available face forward; the fact that the tack taken was not successful does not mean it was unreasonable.\nAppellant\u2019s second issue arises from unsolicited statements made by a Commonwealth witness. The statements were made during the following exchange:\n[COURT REPORTER\u2019S NOTE]:\n(At this point in the proceedings, there was very loud cross-speaking on the part of the following persons, Mr. Moldovsky; Mr. McMahon; the witness, Jean Poller, and the Court. The transcription which follows, therefore, reflects only those portions that this reporter was able to understand.)\nBY MR. MOLDOVSKY [Counsel for the Defense]:\nQ Ma\u2019am, didn\u2019t you call the police when he stole the church\u2019s\u2014\nA He most certainly\u2014\nMR. McMAHON [Counsel for the Commonwealth]: Objection.\nA \u2014did not.\n(Court reporter asks for clarification of question.) THE COURT: Sustained.\nMR. McMAHON: I\u2014\nTHE COURT: With your objecting\u2014\nMR. McMAHON: I withdraw it.\nTHE COURT: You don\u2019t even let the woman answer. THE WITNESS: Why don\u2019t you talk about\u2014\nTHE COURT: That is all.\nTHE WITNESS: \u2014second one\u2014\nTHE COURT: That is all.\nTHE WITNESS: \u2014killed.\nTHE COURT: Madam, just a moment.\n(Courtroom decorum restored)\nWe will not go into this any further.\nThe lady for my purposes has been called merely to identify the fact that her son was alive on a certain day and the next day he was dead. And everyone should understand it. Do you have anything further?\nMR. MOLDOVSKY: Not on this.\nTHE COURT: Do you have anything further?\nMR. McMAHON: No, Sir.\nTHE COURT: You are excused, Miss. Thank you.\nMR. MOLDOVSKY: May it please the Court, may we see you at side bar for a moment?\n(The following takes place at sidebar.)\nMR. MOLDOVSKY: Judge, I would ask that the court reporter read back the very last statement by Mrs. Poller.\nMr. James would you please state, for the record, what you heard the lady say, please?\nMR. JAMES: [Counsel for the Co-Defendant], The lady said very clearly, why don\u2019t you ask him, referring to Mr. Savage, this is the second kid he has killed anyway.\nTHE COURT: I heard that. Now, are you satisfied? What else do you want?\nMR. MOLDOVSKY: I move for a mistrial.\nTHE COURT: It is denied. Your motion is denied. Let\u2019s get to it. Sir, you are puzzling me.\nMR. MOLDOVSKY: In the alternative, I ask Your Honor to give a cautionary instruction to this jury, having denied the motion for a mistrial, asking them to ignore any answer said by the lady when the question\u2014\nTHE COURT: And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like the way that was done. I told you not to do it. I warned you not to do it. You wanted that? I will tell them. Let\u2019s get to it.\n(The following takes place on the record.)\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know whether, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, you heard the last witness\u2019 final comments which was responsive to nothing. But, she did make a comment and pointed to someone and said why don\u2019t you ask him. You are absolutely, unequivocally, without any reservation, I don\u2019t know how to say it any other way, to disregard that comment. It has nothing to do with this trial. I don\u2019t know if you heard it and I don\u2019t care if you didn\u2019t. It is not before you. All right ...\nWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion for a mistrial, this Court has stated that \u201c[a] motion for a mistrial is addressed to the discretion of the court. It is primarily within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether defendant was prejudiced by the misconduct.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gardner, 490 Pa. 421, 426, 416 A.2d 1007, 1009 (1980). On appeal, our standard of review is whether the trial court abused that discretion.\nIn this case, it is unclear whether the jury actually heard the offending statements. Notwithstanding this fact, the judge gave curative instructions telling the jurors that they were to disregard the witness\u2019 unresponsive statements.\nWe have previously stated that emotional outbursts against the defendant by a family member, and references to unrelated prior criminal activity can be cured by the trial court giving curative instructions to the jury. See Commonwealth v. Duffey, 519 Pa. 348, 548 A.2d 1178 (1988); Commonwealth v. Richardson, 496 Pa. 521, 437 A.2d 1162 (1981).\nIn our role as a reviewing court we cannot gain a better view of the alleged effect of these statements than the trial judge, who found no indication that the jury disregarded his emphatic instructions. On this record we find no basis upon which to disagree with his decision.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nNIX, C.J., and ZAPPALA, J., concur in the result.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907(a).\n. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first degree murder conviction and a concurrent period of one to two years imprisonment on the weapons conviction. The trial court did not impose sentence on the conspiracy conviction due apparently to a misreading of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906. That section provides:\nA person may not be convicted of more than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal contempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.\nHere, the trial judge interpreted this section to mean that appellant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy merged into his murder conviction; therefore, he did not impose sentence on the underlying conspiracy conviction. Since this aspect of the sentence was not appealed by the Commonwealth, our purpose in addressing this issue is for the purpose of clarification. This was an incorrect reading of the statute. Section 906 provides only that a defendant cannot be sentenced on multiple inchoate crimes related to the same completed crime; it does not mean that the underlying inchoate crime merges into the completed crime.",
