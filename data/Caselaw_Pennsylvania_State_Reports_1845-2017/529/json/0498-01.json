        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nFollowing a jury trial, appellant, Larry Rush, was convicted of aggravated assault and possessing an instrument of crime. He was sentenced to serve an aggregate prison term of 12 and lk to 25 years. Appellant appeals from the order of the Superior Court, 398 Pa.Super. 648, 573 A.2d 623, affirming the judgments of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\nThe facts giving rise to his convictions are as follows. On May 4, 1987, Edna Nitterauer was working at a Philadelphia bookstore when a man entered the store. The store owner asked if the man needed assistance, but the man told him he only wanted to browse. Five minutes later, Nitterauer approached the man and asked him if he required assistance. They engaged in a casual conversation about hobbies, and the man said that his hobby was making picture frames out of cigarette boxes. The man then asked if the store carried any books concerning heart ailments. Nitterauer showed the man one book, but after leafing through it, he asked for another book. As Nitterauer reached for another book, the man stabbed her eight times in the arm and back. Nitterauer tried to pull away and call for help as the man slammed her into a door and on the floor. The man eventually fled, and Nitterauer succeeded in calling for emergency help.\nJohn Roman, who owned the gas station next door, watched as the rescue squad arrived. As he observed the activity, Roman saw a man fitting the assailant\u2019s description walk out of an alley between the two buildings and cross the street. Both Nitterauer and Roman gave their descriptions of the man to the police.\nBased on these descriptions, the police produced a photo array, which did not include a photo of appellant. Nitterauer and Roman viewed the array separately and neither one identified the assailant. On May 12, 1987, a second photo array, which included appellant\u2019s photo, was presented separately to Nitterauer and Roman. This time, both of them identified appellant.\nAppellant was subsequently arrested. After a two-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime. Appellant appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed.\nAppellant\u2019s first allegation of error involves the trial judge\u2019s answer to a written question presented to the judge by the jury during its deliberations. Appellant contends that the judge\u2019s answer went beyond the scope of the jury\u2019s question and coerced the jury into returning a guilty verdict. The jury posed the following question in a note to the trial judge:\nJudge McCrudden, as foreperson, I have been asked to clarify a matter of procedure regarding our rendering a verdict with a recommendation. We would like to know if it\u2019s appropriate at the time of rendering a verdict that a psychiatric assessment and treatment be strongly recommended. We would like the answer to this question in private____\n(T.T., 2/19/88, p. 2). In response and over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial judge gave the following oral instruction: Jurors, first, let me explain to you that I cannot answer anything in private. It has to be \u2014 my answer has to be given in open court.\nNow, let me take the \u2014 jurors, it\u2019s really two questions as I see it. One, I would like to know if it\u2019s appropriate at the time of rendering a verdict if you can make a recommendation. Jurors, I told you at the outset of the trial it\u2019s the jury\u2019s function to determine whether or not the Commonwealth proved the man guilty or not. Penalty and things of that nature are left to the trial judge.\nSo you cannot make a recommendation. You will determine and answer and sign the verdict sheet. When you return the verdict it will be either guilty or not guilty.\nIn view, I think you\u2019re concerned about what happens afterwards. Let me explain the procedure. If you find the defendant guilty of the charges, then the first thing I mil do is order a psychiatric evaluation and a presentencing investigation. That\u2019s automatic. If you return a verdict of not guilty, then the defendant is completely free on the charges, free from the charges of assaulting the victim Edna Nitterauer and possessing an instrument of crime____\n(T.T., 2/19/88, pp. 7-8) (emphasis added).\nIn reviewing the remarks of a trial judge, we begin by noting that every unwise or irrelevant remark made in the course of a trial by a judge does not compel the granting of a new trial. Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 611, 301 A.2d 673, 674 (1973). \u201cHowever a new trial is required when the judge\u2019s remark is prejudicial; that is when it is of such nature or substance or delivered in such a manner that it may reasonably be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hammer, 508 Pa. 88, 100, 494 A.2d 1054, 1060 (1985).\nOn review, the Superior Court determined correctly that the trial judge\u2019s remarks were prejudicial. Nevertheless the Superior Court concluded that \u201cany prejudice that may have inured to appellant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Mem.Op. at p. 4). In coming to this conclusion, the Superior Court reasoned that:\nAppellant\u2019s sole defense in this case was mis-identification. By the tenor of its question, the jury had already considered and rejected this defense, concluding that appellant had indeed been the man in the book store, because the jury wanted to recommend that appellant be given psychiatric help____ It is only if they believed that he was Ms. Nitterauer\u2019s assailant that they would have been concerned with securing psychiatric help for him____\n(Mem.Op. at p. 5). Thus, because it believed that the jury had already determined appellant\u2019s guilt, the Superior Court found the trial judge\u2019s remarks to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Superior Court, however, had no real way of knowing that the jury had already determined appellant\u2019s guilt. We never know the route a jury takes to arrive at their destination, nor are we permitted to know.\nAn error is harmless only if the appellate court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error is harmless. Commonwealth v. Turner, 499 Pa. 579, 584, 454 A.2d 537, 540 (1982); Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 405, 383 A.2d 155, 162 (1978). An error cannot be held harmless unless the appellate court determines that the error could not have contributed to the verdict. Whenever there is a reasonable possibility that an error might have contributed to the conviction, the error is not harmless. Id., 476 Pa. at 408, 383 A.2d at 164. Thus, \u201cfor a reviewing court to conclude that an error is harmless, it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baez, 494 Pa. 388, 431 A.2d 909 (1981) (emphasis added). The burden of establishing that an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the Commonwealth. Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. at 406, 383 A.2d at 162, n. 11.\nWe are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge\u2019s remarks in the herein case did not contribute to the verdict. It does not necessarily follow that because the jury appeared to be concerned about psychiatric care for the appellant that the jury had already concluded that appellant was indeed guilty. It is reasonable that the jury simply could have been wondering if it could make a recommendation as to punishment in the event it found appellant guilty. Alternatively, the jury may have been unconvinced of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but would have settled on a guilty verdict if petitioner were sentenced to a mental hospital instead of a prison. Either way, the trial judge\u2019s remarks may have directed the jury to reach its verdict of guilty. Consequently, the trial judge\u2019s remarks were not harmless error.\nNext, appellant contends that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a picture frame retrieved from appellant\u2019s home. He argues that the foundation for the introduction of the picture frame was hearsay. We agree.\nAt trial, Detective James Morton testified, over objection, that on June 11, 1987 he went to appellant\u2019s home, which appellant shared with his mother, and spoke to appellant\u2019s mother. Morton further testified that he asked appellant\u2019s mother \u201cif she had any picture frames made by her son Larry Rush,\u201d and that, in response, \u201cshe went upstairs and came back with a picture frame ...\u201d (T.T., 2/18/88, p. 53). The picture frame, made of cigarette boxes, is relevant in that Nitterauer testified that her assailant described his hobby of making picture frames out of cigarette boxes prior to attacking her. The frame was then admitted into evidence.\n\u201cEvidence that is relevant is nonetheless inadmissible if it violates the hearsay rule or any exclusionary rule of evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Lippert, 454 Pa. 381, 383-84, 311 A.2d 586, 587 (1973). The basis for rejecting hearsay evidence is its assumed unreliability because the declarant is not before the trier of fact and cannot be challenged as to the accuracy of the statement. Commonwealth v. Smith, 523 Pa. 577, 593, 568 A.2d 600, 608 (1989). Hearsay testimony also violates the right of the defendant to confront his accuser. Id.\nIn the herein case, appellant\u2019s mother was never called to testify. Thus, her out-of-court, implied statement that appellant had made the picture frame was not subject to cross examination, and appellant did not have an opportunity to confront the witness. The implied statement was hearsay and did not fall into any hearsay exceptions. See Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973).\nThe Superior Court appropriately concluded that this testimony should have been excluded as hearsay but, nonetheless, held that its introduction into evidence was also harmless error. The Superior Court found that the error was harmless because:\n... the only purpose of this evidence was to corroborate Ms. Nitterauer\u2019s identification, and the record is replete with evidence pointing to appellants\u2019 identity as her attacker, including both Ms. Nitterauer\u2019s identification of appellant and Mr. Roman\u2019s, and the matching fingerprint on the book____\n(Mem.Op. at pp. 8-9). While it may be true that the record is replete with evidence identifying appellant as the attacker, we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the hearsay evidence did not contribute to the verdict. Appellant challenged the reliability of both Nitterauer and Roman\u2019s identifications. He also argued that his fingerprint, which was found on the heart ailment book from the bookstore, was obtained during his interrogation by police and not during the attack itself. The only corroborating evidence of identification that appellant was unable to refute was his mother\u2019s implied statement that appellant made the picture frame in question. Given that making picture frames out of cigarette boxes is a rather unusual hobby, the hearsay statement may very well have led the jury to believe that appellant was guilty. We, therefore, conclude that the hearsay statement may well have contributed to the verdict, and thus, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAccordingly, the judgments of sentence are vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\nNIX, C.J., concurs in the result.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.",
