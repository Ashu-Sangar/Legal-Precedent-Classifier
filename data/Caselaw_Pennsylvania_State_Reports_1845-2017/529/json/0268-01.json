        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Judge.\nThe instant matter presents us with an opportunity to consider and assess, for the first time, the scope and constitutionality of the privilege found at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1. For the following reasons, we reverse the orders of the Superior Court and reinstate the orders of the trial court. The following facts are pertinent to our determination.\nA.\nCommonwealth v. Aultman\nAppellee, Wayne O\u2019Brien Aultman, and a co-defendant, James Thistlewood, were charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, criminal conspiracy, and related offenses in connection with the rape of Thistlewood\u2019s wife, Donna. Prior to trial, Aultman sought a subpoena to obtain records maintained by the Delaware County Women Against Rape Crisis Center in the preparation of his defense to the instant charges. The trial judge granted the Center\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena on the grounds that the subpoena would violate the statutory privilege protecting communications between a sexual assault counselor and the victim of such an assault.\nCommonwealth v. Jerry Paul Wilson\nAppellee, Jerry Paul Wilson, was charged with and convicted of the rape and indecent assault of Barbara Marie Hager. Prior to trial, appellee issued a subpoena duces tecum on Alice Paul House, an Indiana County rape crisis center, requesting the production of the Center\u2019s entire file on Barbara Hager. Counsel for Alice Paul House filed a motion to quash the subpoena which was granted on the basis of the privilege purportedly provided by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1.\nIn both of these cases the defendants, appellees herein, appealed. The Superior Court reversed, basing its determinations in these cases on the decision of this Court in In the Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, (\u201cPAAR \u201d), 494 Pa. 15, 428 A.2d 126 (1981). In PAAR, we were faced with a factual situation substantially similar to that of the instant case. In PAAR the defendant sought access to statements made by the victim which were contained in a written report kept on file by PAAR. The defendant\u2019s purpose in requesting these reports was to ascertain the existence of any prior inconsistent statements made by the victim which would support defense counsel\u2019s theory that the victim had consented. The PAAR Court, noting that no statute existed to support PAAR\u2019s assertion of absolute privilege regarding counselor-victim communications, declined to create such a privilege. Instead the court created a limited privilege by which defense counsel would be permitted to inspect \u201cnotes that are verbatim accounts of the complainant\u2019s declarations and notes that the complainant has approved as accurately reflecting what she said.\u201d Id., 494 Pa. at 28, 428 A.2d at 132. However, any information solely relating to the counseling service provided and having no bearing whatsoever on the facts of the alleged offense would be withheld from inspection. The Court in PAAR attempted to balance the public interest in helping the victim to cope with the trauma that inevitably results from a sexual assault against the right of the accused to discover what the complainant has said. Id., 494 Pa. at 24, 428 A.2d at 130, 132. The Court concluded that despite the compelling interest in the victim\u2019s well-being, the accused could not be denied the rights to confrontation and to have the benefit of exculpatory evidence. Accordingly, the defendant was permitted to infringe upon the victim\u2019s privacy to inspect\nonly those statements of the complainant contained in the file which bear on the facts of the alleged offense. The court, however, must not permit defense inspection of statements of the complainant having no bearing on the facts of the alleged offense and relating instead only to the counseling services PAAR provides. The trial court shall not permit defense review of any other aspect of the file.\nId., 494 Pa. at 19, 428 A.2d at 127-28.\nThe Superior Court concluded that the PAAR rationale was applicable in the Aultman and Wilson cases and rejected the applicability of section 5945.1 because appellees had sought not to question the counselors themselves but to examine only the record developed through consultation. Commonwealth v. Aultman, 387 Pa.Super. 113, 563 A.2d 1210 (1989); Commonwealth v. Wilson, 375 Pa.Super. 580, 544 A.2d 1381 (1988). The Commonwealth appealed in both cases, requiring us to consider the effect of the legislative enactment upon our decision in PAAR and upon defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.\nThe statutory privilege provides, in pertinent part:\nA sexual assault counselor has a privilege not to be examined as a witness in any civil or criminal proceeding without the prior written consent of the victim being counseled by the counselor as to any confidential communication made by the victim to the counselor or as to any advice, report or working paper given or made in the course of the consultation.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1(b).\nConfidential communications are defined as\nInformation transmitted between a victim of sexual assault and a sexual assault counselor in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the victim is aware, does not disclose the information to a third person other than those who are present to further the interests of the victim in consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or an accomplishment of the purposes for which the sexual assault counselor is con-suited. The term includes all information received by the sexual assault counselor in the course of that relationship.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1.\nThe Commonwealth argues that by enacting section 5945.1 the General Assembly plainly intended to create a broad privilege and overturn our decision in PAAR. The Commonwealth contends that the Superior Court\u2019s decision effectively abrogates the statute by permitting a defendant to circumvent its provisions through the use of a subpoena duces tecum. It is submitted that the legislative history indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to provide complete confidentiality for rape victims and their counselors, rather than just to prohibit the oral testimony of a sexual assault counselor, because even the production of documents has a testimonial component that is prohibited by the statute.\nThe defendants argue that the explicit language of the statute prohibits only the subpoena of a sexual assault counselor as a witness in a proceeding, and that PAAR established the procedure governing pretrial inspection of counselling records. Defendants submit that this procedure is a fair balancing of the competing interests presented by the situation.\nSection 5945.1 was enacted in December of 1981, subsequent to the PAAR decision of January, 1981. The issue we must consider in this case concerns the effect of Section\n5945.1 on our decision in PAAR. We must decide whether the statutory mandate can be reconciled with the PAAR procedure or must be interpreted to override the PAAR decision. As appellees note, the language of the statute explicitly prohibits the subpoena of a sexual assault counselor as a witness regarding confidential communications by a victim or any records developed during the course of treatment. However, since appellees sought to subpoena only the records in these cases, we must determine whether the statutory language was intended to prohibit the production of documents as well.\nB.\nIn conducting this inquiry we must first ascertain the legislative intent supporting the enactment. We find that the legislative history clearly demonstrates that this statute was response to our decision in PAAR and was intended to remedy what the legislature perceived as a grave injustice committed against those who, because of lesser economic means, were forced to seek counseling from a public center rather than a private therapist. A statement recorded at the time of the statute\u2019s enactments reveals the intent to provide for the rape crisis center client the same confidentiality that would exist if that victim were to seek private psychotherapeutic treatment. Statement of Representative Alden, 1981 Pa.Legislative Journal \u2014 House, pp. 1738-39 (October 14, 1981). It was also noted that the court\u2019s decision in PAAR had severely undermined the effectiveness of rape counseling centers. Thus, we can infer that the legislature, in enacting Section 5945.1, intended to reverse the effect of our decision in PAAR, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c), by preventing the acquisition of all confidential communications by the victim whether in the form of live testimony or through the production of records or other documents.\nThis interpretation of the legislative intent is essential if any privilege is to exist between the sexual assault counsel- or and the victim, and the need for such a privilege cannot be disputed. It is without question that the privilege would exist if the victims had sought private psychotherapeutic treatment. The legislature has recognized that communications between a licensed psychologist and a patient are confidential. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5944. See supra note 3. This statutory privilege has been interpreted as being absolute and has not been outweighed by a defendant\u2019s due process rights. See Commonwealth v. Kyle, 367 Pa.Super. 484, 533 A.2d 120 (1987), appeal denied 518 Pa. 617, 541 A.2d 744 (1988).\nSexual assault counselors serve an equally important function for the rape victim. Extensive research has been conducted documenting the severe psychological, emotional, and social difficulties suffered by rape victims, which cause a condition known as \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d. The devastating effects of this condition create a compelling need for a confidential counseling relationship to enable the victim to cope with the trauma. It is generally recognized that rape traumatizes its victim to a degree far beyond that experienced by victims of other crimes. Rape crisis centers have been developed nationwide to help victims of this most degrading offense recover from its debilitating effects.\nRape crisis centers are service facilities staffed with counselors extensively trained in crisis counseling. These counselors provide victims with much needed physical, psychological and social support during the recovery period that the victims otherwise might not be able to afford. At the onset of counseling the victim is informed that her communications will be confidential, and her willingness to disclose information quite obviously is based upon that expectation. The very nature of the relationship between a counselor and the victim of such a crime exposes the necessity for the same confidentiality that would exist if private psychotherapeutic treatment were obtained. If that confidentiality is removed, that trust is severely undermined, and the maximum therapeutic benefit is lost. The inability of the crisis center to achieve its goals is detrimental not only to the victim but also to society, whose interest in the report and prosecution of sexual assault crimes is furthered by the emotional and physical well-being of the victim.\nClearly, our state has significant interest in protecting the confidentiality of communications between victim and counselor which requires the existence of an absolute privilege as to those communications. Therefore, the statutory privilege considered here must extend to the subpoena of records and other documents developed throughout the counseling relationship, any other interpretation of the statute would render the entire privilege meaningless. If the statute were read to permit a defendant to obtain those records, even to ascertain whether any exculpatory or impeachment evidence could be found therein, the confidentiality in which the statute purports to cloak the statements of the victim would cease to exist. Insulating the counselor from giving testimony would be inconsequential, as most information the counselor might give would be available in the records themselves. This interpretation would yield an absurd result, in contravention of our principles of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922. Accordingly, we hold that the privilege codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1 is intended to be absolute, applying to the production of the documents therein described as well as to the testimony of counselors as explicitly stated.\nC.\nHaving determined that the privilege is absolute, we next must consider whether the absolute privilege violates the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. Appellees assert that a privilege completely denying access to the information sought deprives them of their right to confrontation and compulsory process under the federal and state constitutions. For the following reasons we find that appellees\u2019 constitutional objections have no merit.\nUnder the United States Constitution, an accused is guaranteed the right to confront the witnesses against him. U.S.C.A. Const, amend. VI. The United States Supreme Court has stated that the Confrontation Clause provides two types of protections for a criminal defendant: the right physically to face those who testify against him, and the right to conduct cross-examination. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 50, 107 S.Ct. 989, 997, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987); Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 18-19, 106 S.Ct. 292, 293-94, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985). The defendants\u2019 allegations amount to an assertion that their right to conduct effective cross-examination has been denied.\nWe find the analysis employed by the Supreme Court in Ritchie, supra, to be helpful to our resolution of the instant case. As the Ritchie court noted, the Confrontation Clause protects a defendant\u2019s trial rights. Ritchie, supra, 480 U.S. at 53 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. at 999 n. 9. It should not be constrained to mean that a statutory privilege cannot be maintained when a defendant asserts a need, prior to trial, for the protected information that might be used at trial to impeach or otherwise undermine a witness\u2019 testimony; such an interpretation would \u201ctransform the Confrontation Clause into a constitutionally compelled rule of pretrial discovery. Nothing in the case law supports such a view.\u201d Id. at 52, 107 S.Ct. at 998, citing California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1934, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (\u201c[I]t is this literal right to confront the witnesses at the time of trial that forms the core of the values furthered by the Confrontation Clause\u201d); Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1322, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (\u201cThe right to confrontation is basically a trial right\u201d). The Confrontation Clause merely guarantees a defendant the ability to question adverse witnesses; that ability does not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony. Id. 480 U.S. at 53, 107 S.Ct. at 999. In short, the Confrontation Clause only guarantees \u201can opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d Delaware v. Fensterer, supra, 474 U.S. at 20, 106 S.Ct. at 294, (emphasis in original). Thus, the right to confront one\u2019s witnesses is satisfied if defense counsel receives wide latitude at trial to question witnesses.\nIn the instant matters both victims testified at the respective trials. At appellee Wilson\u2019s trial the victim testified to the facts surrounding the incident. On cross-examination, defense counsel was given wide latitude as he attempted to test the victim\u2019s recollection of those events, and he was permitted, although he declined, to question her about possible other sexual activity on or near the date of the alleged rape. In appellee Aultman\u2019s case the victim testified, and again defense counsel was permitted wide latitude in challenging her recollection and in attempting to shift the blame to the co-defendant. Clearly, in each of these cases the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was satisfied.\nThe Supreme Court in Ritchie also considered the applicability of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Compulsory Process Clause, and a majority of the Court concluded that claims of the type asserted by Ritchie were best analyzed under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. 480 U.S. at 56, 107 S.Ct. at 1000. In Ritchie, a defendant accused of committing various s\u00e9xual offenses against his minor daughter attempted to obtain through discovery a file maintained by Children and Youth Services (CYS) pertaining to the charges. CYS refused to comply with the subpoena, claiming that the records were privileged under 11 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2215. The United States Supreme Court in Ritchie concluded that the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been denied despite the Commonwealth\u2019s asserted compelling interest in the confidentiality of the records sought. The Court reasoned that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in protecting the files could not be compelling, as suggested, because the statute itself provided for disclosure of the files in certain limited circumstances. Id. at 59, 107 S.Ct. at 1002. The recognition by the legislature of those instances of disclosure, the Court found, certainly raised an inference that the defendant could be permitted access to information \u201cmaterial\u201d to his case. Id.\nThe instant case is easily distinguishable from Ritchie. First, as discussed supra, we here are concerned with the absolute privilege which prohibits the disclosure of records under any circumstances absent the victim\u2019s consent. See id. at 57, 107 S.Ct. at 1001. The enactment of an absolute privilege indicates the Commonwealth\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the confidentiality of the rape victim\u2019s records. The broadly drawn privilege is nevertheless narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest in protecting the victim\u2019s privacy so that her treatment and recovery process will be expedited. See supra, 528 Pa. 516, 602 A.2d 1295. Therefore, defendant\u2019s federal constitutional rights have not been violated.\nDefendants also claim that the recent case of Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 523 Pa. 427, 567 A.2d 1357 (1989), mandates the conclusion that the denial of defense counsel\u2019s access to these records violates the defendants\u2019 rights under the state constitution. In Lloyd, the defendant sought to obtain from Medical College of Pennsylvania the psycho-therapeutic records of a six-year-old girl whom he allegedly had raped. The trial court denied his request. This Court reversed, holding that defendant\u2019s state constitutional rights to confrontation and compulsory process required that he be permitted to inspect the records. The Court voted, however, that the Lloyd case, unlike the Ritchie case, did not involve a statutory privilege. Rather, the Court in Lloyd was concerned with a common law privilege which could not defeat a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Implicit in the distinction drawn by the Lloyd court is the recognition that the existence of a statutory privilege is an indication that the legislature acknowledges the significance of a particular interest and has chosen to protect that interest. As the Supreme Court stated in Ritchie, supra,\nAlthough we recognize that the public interest in protecting this type of sensitive information is strong, we do not agree that this interest necessarily prevents disclosure in all circumstances. This is not a case where a state statute grants CYS the absolute authority to shield its files from all eyes. Cf 42 Pa Cons Stat \u00a7 5945.1(b) (1982) (unqualified statutory privilege for communications between sexual assault counselors and victims). Rather, the Pennsylvania law provides that the information shall be disclosed in certain circumstances, including when CYS is directed to do so by court order. PA Stat Ann, Title 11, \u00a7 2215(a)(5) (Purdon Supp 1986). Given that the Pennsylvania Legislature contemplated some use of CYS records in judicial proceedings, we cannot conclude that the statute prevents all disclosures in criminal prosecutions. In the absence of any apparent state policy to the contrary, we therefore have no reason to believe that relevant information would not be disclosed when a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the information is \u201cmaterial\u201d to the defense of the accused.\nRitchie, supra, 480 U.S. at 57-58,107 S.Ct. at 1001-02. As previously noted, the statutory privilege instantly at issue provides even greater protection than did the statute asserted in the Ritchie case. Therefore, an objection based on the protections afforded by the state constitution must also fail.\nAccordingly, the orders of the Superior Court are reversed.\nMcDERMOTT, j., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nLARSEN, J., files a concurring opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Mr. Aultman was charged with the rape of Mrs. Thistlewood upon her allegations that her husband, while attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with her, summoned Mr. Aultman from the next room to participate in the encounter. Mr. Thistlewood was also charged in the rape but is not a party to this appeal.\n. This provision has since been amended to provide more explicitly the absolute protection previously implied:\n(b) Privilege.\u2014\n(1) No sexual assault counselor may, without the written consent of the victim, disclose the victim\u2019s confidential oral or written communications to the counselor nor consent to be examined in any court or criminal proceeding.\nAs amended 1990, Dec. 17, P.L. 737, No. 183, \u00a7 1, imd. effective. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1(b)(1).\n. This statute has since been amended to provide protection irrespective of the victim\u2019s expectation of confidentiality. It provides as follows:\n\u201cConfidential communication.\" All information, oral or written, transmitted between a victim of sexual assault and a sexual assault counselor in the course of their relationship, including, but not limited to, any advice, reports, statistical data memoranda, working papers, records or the like, given or made during that relationship.] 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1(a).\nIt should be noted that the statutes are set forth and discussed in the text as they existed at the time of appellees\u2019 trials.\n. Statements made by legislators during the enactment process are not dispositive of legislative intent. Commonwealth v. Alcoa Properties, 440 Pa. 42, 46 n. 1, 269 A.2d 748, 750 n. 1 (1970). However, they may properly be considered as part of the contemporaneous legislative history. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(7). See, e.g., South Whitehall Twp. Police Service v. South Whitehall Twp., 521 Pa. 82, 88, 89, 555 A.2d 793, 796-7 (1989); Com. v. DePasquale, 509 Pa. 183, 190-91, 501 A.2d 626 (1985).\n. The privilege for the records of a private psychologist is found at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5944:\nNo person who has been licensed ... to practice psychology shall be,\" without the written consent of his client, examined in any civil or criminal matter as to any information acquired in the course of his professional services in behalf of such client. The confidential relations and communications between a psychologist and his client shall be on the same basis as those provided or prescribed by law between an attorney and client.\n. A statement submitted for the Legislative Journal referred to this Court\u2019s decision in In the Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 494 Pa. 15, 428 A.2d 126 (1981), and pointed out the detrimental effect of that decision on rape crisis centers \u2014 several victims had requested the return of their records or had terminated counseling altogether because of their fear that private information would become public. The statement emphasized the necessity for legislation to overrule the PAAR decision so that the counseling relationship would not disintegrate totally. In his statement, Representative Alden stressed the need to \u201creverse the court\u2019s ruling and to provide complete confidentiality for rape victims and counselors.\" Statement of Representative Alden, 1981 Pa.Legislative Journal \u2014 House, pp. 1738-39 (October 14, 1981).\n. Significantly, the legislature rejected a proposal which included the very procedure established in PAAR.\n. The same result was reached by the Supreme Court of Illinois in People v. Foggy, 121 Ill.2d 337, 118 Ill.Dec. 18, 521 N.E.2d 86 (1988).\n. In fact, Aultman himself conducted a portion of the cross-examination and was given a significant amount of leeway by the court despite his lack of organization.\n. The statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\u00a7 2215. Confidentiality of records\n(a) Except as provided in section 14 [relating to the record-keeping procedure], reports made pursuant to this act including but not limited to report summaries of child abuse made pursuant to section 6(b) [relating to police and other written and oral reports of child abuse] and written reports made pursuant to section 6(c) as well as any other information obtained, reports written or photographs or x-rays taken concerning alleged instances of child abuse in the possession of the department, a county children and youth social service agency or a child protective service shall be confidential and shall only be made available to [certain entities listed, in which a defendant or defense counsel in a child abuse action is not included].\n11 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2215(a).\n. These include a duly authorized official of a child protective service; a physician examining or treating a child; a guardian ad litem for the child; a duly authorized official of the Department of Public Welfare; a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a court order; a standing committee of the General Assembly to ascertain legislative oversight; the Attorney General; federal auditors if required for federal financial participation; law enforcement officials investigating or receiving reports of abuse; county commissioners for investigative purposes; and a mandated reporter (i.e. physicians, social workers, teachers) of child abuse who made a report. 11 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2215(a)(l)-(a)(12).",

A majority of this Court in PAAR rejected the claim that an absolute privilege existed for all communications between rape crisis center personnel and rape victims. Instead, the majority held that records of a rape victim\u2019s statements to rape crisis counselors may be subpoenaed and disclosed at trial. Id., 494 Pa. at 26-28, 428 A.2d at 131-132.\nIn my dissent in PAAR, I vigorously advocated expanding the common law to recognize an absolute testimonial privilege for all communications between rape victims and rape crisis center counselors. I pointed out that a victim of rape \u201csuffers an invasion of her bodily privacy in an intensely personal and unsettling manner, triggering a number of emotional and psychological reactions running the gamut from shock, fear, distrust and anger to guilt, shame and disgust.\u201d Id., 494 Pa. at 38, 428 A.2d at 138 (Larsen, J., dissenting). I stated that the term \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d has evolved to encompass this recurring pattern of post-rape symptoms that is essentially unique to the rape victim.\nI further stressed that the need for and benefits of counseling for a rape victim are extraordinary, and the most accessible counseling for a rape victim is the rape crisis counselor. Without doubt, I stated, confidentiality is essential to the relationship between the rape victim and rape crisis counselor because it encourages victims to seek treatment and helps victims realize the full benefit of the psychotherapeutic relationship. In conclusion, I appealed to the legislature \u201cto take cognizance of the rape victim\u2019s plight and to act promptly and compassionately in legislatively enacting a rape victim/rape crisis counselor testimonial privilege.\u201d Id., 494 Pa. at 62-63, 428 A.2d at 150 (Larsen, J., dissenting).\nThe legislature was quick to respond. Within a year, the legislature had enacted the statute at issue, which created such a testimonial privilege. In a statement made part of the legislative record, State Representative John Alden essentially adopted my dissent in PAAR and revealed that the intent of the statute was to reverse the effects of PAAR. Statement of Representative Alden, 1981 Pa.Legislative Journal \u2014 House, pp. 1738-39, (October 14, 1981). Thus, the legislature was absolutely clear in its intent to undo the disastrous effects of the majority decision in PAAR by adopting my dissent, and therefore, the only plausible interpretation of this statute is that it provides an absolute testimonial privilege for confidential communications between rape victims and their rape crisis counselors.\nPAPADAKOS, J., joins in this concurring opinion.\n.

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe hallowed principle that one remains innocent until proven guilty is hollow indeed if one\u2019s constitutional rights must always bend to a statutory privilege. When a defendant has shown a legitimate need for access to communications, the testimonial privilege expressed in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5945.1 must yield to the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant to due process and to confront his accuser. In the absence of any demonstration by the defendant that the victim\u2019s communications with the counselor would provide a source of impeachment, I would not breach the privilege. The majority, however, forecloses all possibility that the defendant may obtain a victim\u2019s statements even upon a legitimate showing of need for access. I am gravely concerned that we have lost all sense of what our constitutional rights guarantee.\nThe majority\u2019s sanctification of the statutory privilege is at great cost to our constitutional rights. I am sympathetic to the physical and emotional trauma suffered by a rape victim, but I am not willing to sacrifice the guarantees of our Constitution to assuage the harm. I commend the analysis of this Court in In The Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, (\u201cPAAR\u201d), 494 Pa. 15, 428 A.2d 126 (1981). It is no less compelling today:\nThere is an undoubtable public interest in helping victims of rape to cope with inevitable disruption of emotional stability caused by the physical assaults they suffer. There is an equally compelling public interest in encouraging victims of violent crime to come forward. We would be closing our eyes to reality were we to discount the value of rape crisis centers in fostering these vital public interests.\nIt must be remembered, however, that our system of criminal justice is a search for truth. As the Supreme Court of the United States observed, \u201cdisclosure, rather than suppression, of relevant materials ordinarily promotes the proper administration of criminal justice.\u201d Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 870, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 1849, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966). Accord, e.g., Lewis v. Court of Common Pleas, 436 Pa. 296, 304 n. 4 260 A.2d 184,189 n. 4 (1969). So too, the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice states: \u201cWhere life, liberty and protection of communities from crime are the stakes, gamesmanship is out of place.\u201d Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial \u00a7 1.1 Comment at p. 31 (Approved Draft 1970). I agree with the words of Justice Simon of the Supreme\nCourt of Illinois in his Dissenting Opinion in The People of the State of Illinois v. Foggy, 121 Ill.2d 337, 118 Ill.Dec. 18, 521 N.E.2d 86 (1988):\nIn determining which interests and relationships should be protected by privilege, and to what extent they should be protected, courts and legislatures must balance the State\u2019s interest in the privilege against the constraints the privilege places on the fair and effective administration of justice. In the present case, the State\u2019s interest in providing confidential counseling services to the victims of rape must be weighed against the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process of law and to confrontation of witnesses against him. Although the State\u2019s interest in this case is a strong one and undoubtedly justifies a statute conferring some privilege protection on counseling records ... it is not strong enough to sustain an absolute privilege which renders meaningless the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\nThe legislative action of enacting the privilege for a sexual assault counselor does not dissuade me from concluding that the Pennsylvania Constitution permits a defendant to obtain exculpatory evidence. The in-camera review procedure developed in PAAR successfully balanced the rights of the accuser and the rights of the accused. The accuser was protected from unwarranted intrusions into the counseling process and the accused had access to statements bearing on the facts of the alleged offense.\nThat the legislative response to PAAR was swift and empathetic to the rape victim does not relieve this Court of our responsibility to declare unconstitutional legislation that denies a defendant his constitutional rights. The Constitution of this Commonwealth is the absolute \u2014 a legislative enactment of a statutory privilege is not.",
