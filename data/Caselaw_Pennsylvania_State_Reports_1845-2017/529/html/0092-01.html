In particular, appellant argues that expert testimony adduced by the Commonwealth on the issue of blood alcohol content was sufficiently ambiguous as to leave open to speculation the question of his blood alcohol content while driving. Upon the record presented, we agree that the evidence of appellant’s blood alcohol level was insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol level was equal to or greater than 0.10% while driving.</p>

In contrast, we note that the legislatures of certain other states have enacted statutes making it an offense to drive with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% “as shown by” or “as determined by” a blood alcohol test administered within a specified time <em>after </em>driving has ceased.

See generally 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547 (chemical testing to determine amount of alcohol). In cases where test results show levels of alcohol significantly above 0.10% and where blood samples have been obtained soon after suspects have been stopped, there is a very strong inference that blood alcohol levels were in the prohibited range while driving. However, where, as in the present case, the blood test result barely exceeded the 0.10% level and the lapse of time between driving and the taking of the blood sample was not insignificant, the inference of guilt is weakened.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[261,913,1150,854]]]'>The blood test in this case was not performed until approximately one hour after appellant was stopped. It revealed a blood alcohol content that was only narrowly above the 0.10% level, i.e., 0.114%. The Commonwealth introduced testimony from an expert witness who was the director of the hospital laboratory where appellant’s blood test was performed. He stated that the laboratory’s blood testing equipment had a margin of error of plus or minus 10%, and that this fact could have meant that appellant’s blood alcohol level was as low as 0.104%. He testified also that a person’s blood alcohol level fluctuates with the passage of time, such that the level gradually rises after drinks have been consumed until a peak is reached roughly sixty to ninety minutes after drinking has ceased, and that, thereafter, the level slowly declines. This testimony was uncontradicted.</p>

Indeed, during cross-examination the expert witness for the Commonwealth stated that, if appellant finished his last drink at 9 p.m., as was appellant’s uncontradicted testimony, then his blood alcohol level would probably still have been rising at 10:10 p.m. The expert stated further that, if the level was rising at 10:10 p.m., appellant’s blood alcohol level at the time of driving was probably less than 0.10%. He could not determine with any degree of clinical certainty, however, whether the level was in fact rising or falling at 10:10 p.m. In short, there was no evidence upon which the expert could offer an opinion as to whether appellant’s blood alcohol level was in fact greater than or equal to 0.10% at the time of driving.</p>

Given these principles, why can the Commonwealth not prove a violation of the statute with a highly accurate blood test? Is it not relevant circumstantial evidence sufficient to prove the crime charged?</p>

However, due to the defendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to give evidence against himself, the Commonwealth cannot and should not be able to compel the defendant to relate when he drank, how much he drank, and when he consumed his last drink. Without this information, no expert will be able to ascertain whether the defendant’s blood alcohol was rising or falling at the time of the blood <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>alcohol test. Thus, if we require the Commonwealth to present expert evidence in a case charged under the statute, we are levying an impossible burden on the Commonwealth to prove its case.</p>

Every time there is a case in which the test results are between .10 and .15 percent (approximately), and the test was not conducted within minutes of the actual driving, the Commonwealth will be unable to prove its case. This would defeat the vital purpose and intent of the statute and would operate as a <em>de facto </em>evisceration of the .10 percent blood alcohol limitation in the statute.</p>

If people choose to drive when their blood alcohol is elevated, then they should take enough care to make certain they are within legal limits. The jury was free to disbelieve appellant's evidence that his blood alcohol was rising at the time of the test (which they apparently did) and find that there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant under the statute.</p>
