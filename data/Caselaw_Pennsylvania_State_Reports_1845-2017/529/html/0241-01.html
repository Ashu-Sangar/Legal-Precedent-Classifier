While we agree that violations of the Code do not <em>per se </em>give rise to legal actions that may be brought by clients or other private parties, we, nevertheless, conclude that the record supports a finding that Appellees’ conduct here constituted a breach of common law fiduciary duty owed to Appellant-clients and that, contrary to Appellees’ argument that they cannot be prevented from representing a former client’s competitors, the injunction issued by the trial court against Appellees should have been sustained by the Superior Court. As a result, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court, as more fully explained below.</p>

      <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>Appellants, plaintiffs in the trial court and appellees in the Superior Court, are Maritrans GP Inc., Maritrans Partners L.P. and Maritrans Operating Partners L.P. (hereinafter, collectively, “Maritrans”). Appellees, defendants in the trial court and appellants in the Superior Court, are the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton &amp; Scheetz (hereinafter “Pepper”), and one of Pepper’s partners, J. Anthony Messina, Jr. (hereinafter “Messina”). In February, 1988, Maritrans brought an action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as for compensatory and punitive damages, against Pepper and Messina, its former attorneys of more than ten years. Maritrans’ action arises out of Pepper and Messina’s representation of Maritrans’ competitors, entities whose interests were found to be adverse to the interests of Maritrans, in matters substantially related to matters in which they had represented Maritrans.</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.4",350,[255,1167,1150,836]]]'>On May 1, 1989, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County entered an order preliminarily enjoining Pepper and Messina from continuing to act as labor counsel for seven of Maritrans’ New York-based competitors, with the exception of one discrete piece of litigation then scheduled to commence on May 8, 1989. The trial court ruled that preliminary injunctive relief was necessary given the existence of a substantial relationship (i.e., a conflict of interest in derogation of Pepper and Messina’s fiduciary duties to Maritrans) between Pepper and Messina’s current representation of the New York companies, whose interests were adverse to the interests of Maritrans, and their former longstanding representation of Maritrans. Pepper and Messina then moved in the trial court for a stay pending appeal, and certain of the New York competitors moved for leave to intervene in the action. Both motions were denied.</p>

R.A.P. 123(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The matter is now on full appeal to this Court. For the reasons explained below, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[207,665,1155,1052]]]'>The facts taken in a light most favorable to Maritrans, the winner at the trial court level, are as follows: Maritrans is a Philadelphia-based public company in the business of transporting petroleum products along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States by tug and barge. Maritrans competes in the marine transportation business with other tug and/or barge companies, including a number of companies based in New York. Pepper is an old and established Philadelphia law firm. Pepper and Messina represented Maritrans or its predecessor companies in the broadest range of labor relations matters for well over a decade. In addition, Pepper represented Maritrans in a complex public offering of securities, a private offering of $115 million in debt, a conveyance of all assets, and a negotiation and implementation of a working capital line of credit. Over the course of the representation, Pepper was paid approximately $1 million for its labor representation of Maritrans and, in the last year of the representation, approximately $1 million for its corporate and securities representation of Maritrans.</p>

This <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>information was discussed with Pepper’s labor attorneys, and particularly with Messina, for the purpose of developing Maritrans’ labor goals and strategies. In addition, during the course of preparing Maritrans’ public offering, Pepper was furnished with substantial confidential commercial information in Maritrans’ possession — financial and otherwise — including projected labor costs, projected debt coverage and projected revenues through the year 1994, and projected rates through the year 1990. Pepper and Messina, during the course of their decade-long representation of Maritrans, came to know the complete inner-workings of the company along with Maritrans’ long-term objectives, and competitive strategies in a number of areas including the area of labor costs, a particularly sensitive area in terms of effective competition. In furtherance of its ultimate goal of obtaining more business than does its competition, including the New York-based companies, Maritrans analyzed each of its competitors with Pepper and Messina. These analyses included an evaluation of each competitor’s strengths and weaknesses, and of how Maritrans deals with its competitors.</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[246,1419,1148,418]]]'>Armed with this information, Pepper and Messina subsequently undertook to represent several of Maritrans’ New York-based competitors. Indeed, Pepper and Messina undertook to represent the New York companies in their labor negotiations, albeit with a different union, during which the New York companies sought wage and benefit reductions in order to compete more effectively with, <em>i.e., </em>to win business away from, Maritrans.</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[245,1854,1148,472]]]'>In September, 1987, Maritrans learned from sources outside of Pepper that Pepper and Messina were representing four of its New York-based competitors in their labor relations matters. Maritrans objected to these representations, and voiced those objections to many Pepper attorneys, including Mr. Messina. Pepper and Messina took the position that this was a “business conflict,” not a “legal conflict,” and that they had no fiduciary or ethical duty to Maritrans that would prohibit these representations.</p>
    <p id="b353-3" data-blocks='[["BL_353.3",353,[210,292,1152,898]]]'>
      <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>To prevent Pepper and Messina from taking on the representation of any other competitors, especially its largest competitor, Bouchard Transportation Company, Maritrans agreed to an arrangement proposed by Pepper whereby Pepper would continue as Maritrans’ counsel but would not represent any more than the four New York companies it was then already representing. In addition, Messina — the Pepper attorney with the most knowledge about Mari-trans — was to act not as counsel for Maritrans but, rather, as counsel for the New York companies, while two other Pepper labor attorneys would act as counsel for Maritrans; the attorneys on one side of this “Chinese Wall” would not discuss their respective representations with the attorneys on the other side. Maritrans represented that it agreed to this arrangement because it believed that this was the only way to keep Pepper and Messina from representing yet more of its competitors, especially Bouchard.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[205,1209,1156,1119]]]'>Unbeknownst to Maritrans, however, Messina then “parked” Bouchard and another of the competitors, Eklof, with Mr. Vincent Pentima, a labor attorney then at another law firm, at the same time that Messina was negotiating with Pentima for Pentima’s admission into the partnership at Pepper. Moreover, notwithstanding Pepper’s specific agreement not to represent these other companies, Messina for all intents and purposes was representing Bouchard and Eklof, as he was conducting joint negotiating sessions for those companies and his other four New York clients. On November 5, 1987, Maritrans executives discussed with Pepper attorneys, <em>inter alia, </em>Maritrans’ plans and strategies of an aggressive nature in the event of a strike against the New York companies. Less than one month later, on December 2, 1987, Pepper terminated its representation of Maritrans in all matters. Later that month, on December 23, 1987, Pepper undertook the representation of the New York companies. Then, on January 4, 1988, Mr. Pentima joined Pepper as a partner and brought with him, as clients, Bouchard and Eklof. In February, 1988, Maritrans filed a complaint in the trial court against Pepper and Messina.</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>Discovery procedures produced evidence as follows: (i) testimony by principals of the New York companies to the effect that the type of information that Pepper and Messina possess about Maritrans is of the type considered to be confidential commercial information in the industry and that they would not reveal that information about their companies to their competitors; (ii) testimony by principals of the New York companies that they were desirous of obtaining Maritrans’ confidential commercial information; (iii) testimony by principals of the New York companies that labor costs are the one item that make or break a company’s competitive posture; (iv) an affidavit from the United States Department of Labor attesting that, contrary to defendant Messina’s sworn testimony at the first preliminary hearing in February, 1988, Maritrans’ labor contracts are not on file with the Department of Labor and thus not available under the Freedom of Information Act; and other information as well.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[237,1267,1152,834]]]'>After initially denying the preliminary injunction, the trial court delivered a bench opinion in which it was stated that the court had <em>sua sponte </em>reconsidered its decision not to enter injunctive relief against Pepper and Messina. The trial court specifically noted that by denying Maritrans’ request for preliminary injunctive relief the week before— even in the face of various breaches of Pepper and Messina’s fiduciary duties to Maritrans — it had not “fully accounted] for the special relationship between attorney and client ...” but, rather, had inappropriately treated the case as a “commercial dispute involving ordinary business interests.” Upon further reflection and after re-reviewing the voluminous record in this case, the trial court determined that preliminary injunctive relief was both justified and appropriate. See, Trial Court Opinion, 4/26/89, at pp. 5-8, 5-17.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[235,2127,1148,205]],["BL_355.1",355,[212,298,1151,1161]]]'>In reconsidering <em>sua sponte </em>the initial decision not to enjoin Pepper and Messina, the trial court held that by initially focusing on only the November 5, 1987, meeting between Pepper attorneys and the Maritrans executives— <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>and not on Pepper and Messina’s entire representation of Maritrans — the court had taken too restrictive a view of the test to determine whether attorneys have breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in former-client conflicts of interest, <em>i.e., </em>the substantial relationship test. The trial court went on to hold that a substantial relationship exists between Pepper and Messina’s former representation of Maritrans and their current representation of the competitors, entities whose interests are materially adverse to the interests of Maritrans in the current representation. The trial court also found that Pepper breached its obligation, which was fortified by a specific promise, to keep from Messina that which was learned after the erection of the “Chinese wall.” Concluding that Maritrans was entitled to be able to proceed in its business with confidence that its plans and strategies would not be disclosed or used by Appellees, even inadvertently, the trial court ruled that preliminary injunctive relief was warranted given the existence of material adversity between Maritrans and the New York competitors, of a substantial relationship between the representations, and the fact that Maritrans had carried its burden in proving the necessity for a preliminary injunction.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[212,1477,1151,469]],["BL_356.1",356,[225,303,1149,365]]]'>The Superior Court reversed stating that the trial court erred by issuing a preliminary injunction based upon Pepper’s alleged violation of the [Pennsylvania] Rules of Professional Conduct<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> without making any independent finding that Pepper’s conduct was actionable. The Superior Court found that the trial court’s use of Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7 and 1.9 as points of reference for its breach of fiduciary duty analysis improperly augmented the substantive law of our Commonwealth. The Superior <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>Court did not analyze whether the common law principles of fiduciary duty, embodied in those rules, nonetheless apply to this case. The Superior Court then held that an attorney’s conflict of interest in representing a subsequent client whose interests are materially adverse to a prior client in a substantially related matter is not “actionable” in Pennsylvania. As already noted, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[225,696,1150,795]]]'>The public’s trust in the legal profession undoubtedly would be undermined if this Court does not correct the Superior Court’s failure to recognize the common law foundation for the principle that an attorney’s representation of a subsequent client whose interests are materially adverse to a former client in a matter substantially related to matters in which he represented the former client constitutes an impermissible conflict of interest actionable at law. The Superior Court’s decision is diametrically opposed to law established by the courts of this Commonwealth and throughout the United States which have imposed civil liability on attorneys for breaches of their fiduciary duties by engaging in conflicts of interest, notwithstanding the existence of professional rules under which the attorneys also could be disciplined.</p>

The court was also correct in saying that the trial court’s finding of violation of the ethical rules concerning misuse of a client’s confidences is not as such a basis for issuing an injunction.

    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[248,716,1150,507]]]'>However, the Superior Court then stood this correct analysis on its head.

None was a disciplinary case. <em>Consolidated Theatres </em>and <em>United States v.

A motion for disqualification is simply <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>an injunctive order issued in a case already pending.

Since misuse of a <em>law firm’s </em>confidences is actionable while also being an ethical violation, surely misuse of a <em>client’s </em>confidences can be actionable while also being an ethical violation.

      <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>Pepper and Messina argue that a preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion where it restrains them from representing a former client’s competitors, in order to supply the former client with a “sense of security” that they will not reveal confidences to those competitors where there has been no revelation or threat of revelations up to that point. We disagree. Whether a fiduciary can later represent competitors or whether a law firm can later represent competitors of its former client is a matter that must be decided from case to case and depends on a number of factors. One factor is the extent to which the fiduciary was involved in its former client’s affairs. The greater the involvement, the greater the danger that confidences (where such exist) will be revealed. Here, Pepper and Messina’s involvement was extensive as was their knowledge of sensitive information provided to them by Mari-trans. We do <em>not </em>wish to establish a blanket rule that a law firm may not later represent the economic competitor of a former client in matters in which the former client is not also a party to a law suit. But situations may well exist where the danger of revelation of the confidences of a former client is so great that injunctive relief is warranted. This is one of those situations. There is a substantial relationship here between Pepper and Messina’s former representation of Maritrans and their current representation of Maritrans’ competitors such that the injunctive relief granted here was justified. It might be theoretically possible to argue that Pepper and Messina should merely be enjoined from revealing the confidential material they have acquired from Maritrans but such an injunction would be difficult, if not impossible, to administer. On this point, see, <em>Lubin v. Lubin, </em><a href="/citations/?q=302%20P.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="302 P.2d 49">302 P.2d 49</a>, <a href="/cal-app-2d/144/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="144 Cal.

On these facts, it was perfectly reasonable to con-<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>elude that Maritrans’ competitive position could be irreparably injured if Pepper and Messina continued to represent their competitors and that Maritrans’ remedy at law, that is their right to later seek damages, would be difficult if not impossible to sustain because of difficult problems of proof, particularly problems related to piercing what would later become a confidential relationship between their competitors and those competitors’ attorneys (Pepper and Messina). The trial court already had to struggle with the problem of confidentiality in this regard. See, Trial Court opinion, 4/26/89, at pp. 9-12. In short, equitable principles establish that injunctive relief here was just and proper. Damages might later be obtained for breach of fiduciary duties and a confidential relationship, but that remedy would be inadequate to correct the harm that could be prevented by injunctive relief, at least until the court could examine the case in greater detail.</p>

But could it be said that an attorney who misappropriates client funds is not civilly liable to his client, and that the client’s only recourse upon discovery that his attorney has misappropriated his funds is to report the attorney to the Disciplinary Board? It is obvious that this is not and cannot be the rule.

Although Maritrans repeatedly insists that it has no way of knowing whether confidences have actually been disclosed because attorney-client privilege makes that fact difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, it does not deny conceding the absence of disclosure at the prior proceeding before this Court. Moreover, the majority in the instant appeal concedes that the concern is not that actual disclosure has occurred, but that the circumstances create significant potential for such disclosure.</p>
