At about 10:00 p.m. on November 4, 1987, Leon Washington, Anthony Gates and <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>some of their friends were drinking beer in a playground located at 15th and York Streets in the City of Philadelphia. At about this time a girl approached the group of men and asked where she could get some “nickel caps” (a slang term for $5.00 worth of cocaine). Washington teasingly responded that he did have “nickel caps” when in reality he did not and began a conversation with the girl. Eventually the girl realized that Washington had nothing to offer her and she ended the conversation and began using a swing.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[242,825,1148,419]]]'>When she attempted to jump off the still moving swing she fell hitting her head on the pavement. Washington indicated that he believed she may have been injured and ran down the street with his friends to a nearby bar, the Red Top Bar, in order to phone for help. Because the phone at this bar was busy, they proceeded to a dry cleaning store across the street from the bar and tried to use their phone which was also busy.</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[240,1273,1149,419]]]'>Within ten minutes of the girl’s injury, Washington and his companions were standing on the corner of 16th and York Streets where they were confronted by some other men, including Appellant, and the girl. The girl pointed out Gates, Washington, and another companion (Maurice Evans) to Appellant, whereupon he pulled out a gun and fired once at Gates, hitting him from a range of one and one half to two feet in the upper left side of the front of his chest.</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[239,1721,1149,633]]]'>At the sound of the gun discharging everyone began running, including Washington who was six feet behind the decedent. In the attempt to flee, Washington tripped over Evans and fell to the ground, and Appellant began shooting at Washington as he laid at his feet, hitting him in the hand and stomach while he pleaded to be left alone. As Washington struggled to escape, Appellant shot at him a third time, this time hitting him in the side as he finally managed to get to his feet and run away from his assailant. Gates died shortly after being shot and Washington suffered serious injuries which required extensive hospital treatment including having a colostomy operation performed.</p>

The Crimes Code defines murder of the first degree as, “[a] criminal homicide ... committed by an intentional,” i.e., “willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), (d). From the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, the jury could infer that the killing was intentional and malicious. <em>Commonwealth v.

From the manner of the killing, the jury could conclude that the killing was premeditated and the jury could conclude that Appellant committed the crime from the direct evidence linking him with the shootings.

The Commonwealth rested at this point as did the defense. During the closing argument to the jury, the Commonwealth argued that Appellant’s motive in shooting his victims may have been revenge for the injury the girl had suffered while in the company of Washington and the decedent.</p>
