His victim, the twelve year old granddaughter of a close family friend and neighbor, testified that the offensive conduct occurred during a one year period in 1985 and 1986 and involved approximately one hundred separate incidents which escalated from fondling and masturbation to oral and vaginal intercourse.</p>

Weller was called to testify as to the treatment he provided the victim after she was admitted to Southwood Hospital for severe depression, self-mutilation, and suicidal thoughts in December of 1986. Weller was questioned about his occupation, and he described his work with troubled children, only some of whom were the victims of sexual abuse. Within the context of outlining his role at Southwood in terms of <em>all </em>of the cases with which he dealt, Weller testified as follows:</p>

Part of that work is to interview extensively the family, and also the child, to pick up and see if there are any discrepancies in terms of what either of them are saying, and also to determine reliability of the information that’s being provided to me. So, as a part of that function, in addition to getting the history from the family, I also talk to the child to either confirm or deny what the adults are telling me, and I have found, within the practice, at least the children I’m working with right now, have a <em>fairly high reliability of the </em>information—</blockquote>
