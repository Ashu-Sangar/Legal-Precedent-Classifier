Those desiring additional passes and others, such as vendors and contractors, may purchase yearly passes to enter the property in lieu of paying tolls. Moseywood Road is connected at one end to a township road and at the other end to a Commonwealth road. It is posted as a “Private Access Road” with a speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour. The toll booths are attended around the clock, but no individual reaching the toll booths in a vehicle and paying the posted fee is asked about his or her destination.</p>

Appellant owns the road and does not merely have a franchise interest in collecting tolls. The public does not have the <em>right </em>to enter appellant’s property, and indeed, appellant has posted the road to inform the public that its road is a “Private Access Road.” Finally, Moseywood Road does not even extend half the distance of those turnpike roads which, in 1849, could be officially licensed by the governor for the purpose of collecting tolls.</p>
