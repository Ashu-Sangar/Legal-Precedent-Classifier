For if an informed electorate disagrees with the proposed amendments, they will have an opportunity to indicate their pleasure at the ballot box and elect individuals to the next General Assembly with different attitudes. The advertising provisions are mandatory and in the past we have required that the provisions be strictly complied with:</p>

It has in clear, specific language determined what must be done to change or amend the fundamental law. Nothing short of a literal compliance with this mandate will suffice. The Constitution has a more sacred position in judicial interpretations than does an act of assembly and judicial exploration should never have as its fulcrum the basic law. Otherwise a dangerous precedent would be created, by substituting the court’s own pronouncement for the fundamental law of the State. To hold that advertising provisions do not require literal compliance would create the danger that other procedural steps required by the article may be modified or omitted entirely.

    <p id="b716-4" data-blocks='[["BL_716.4",716,[236,573,1149,676]]]'>The record quite clearly shows that on Thursday, August 2, 1990, the Secretary sent letters to the various newspapers directing them to advertise no later than Monday, August 6, 1990. Setting aside for the moment that some of the publications chosen were free shopping publications (which do not qualify as newspapers), 118 newspapers were given Friday, August 3, 1990, Saturday, August 4, 1990, and Sunday August 5,1990 to comply with the Secretary’s directive and publish the advertisement on or before August 6, 1990. Under such circumstances the Chancellor was justified in finding that the Secretary did not transmit the notices in ample time to permit its insertion three months before the general election.</p>
    <p id="b716-5" data-blocks='[["BL_716.5",716,[235,1267,1149,467]]]'>The Secretary, through his staff, testified that the August 2, 1990, mailing was in ample time to permit the 18 newspapers to publish during the <em>month </em>of August, 1990, and that such an advertising would satisfy the constitutional requirement pursuant to a 1972 opinion of the Attorney General (N.T., Volume III, p. 519). To the extent that the Secretary, or his staff, relied on any authority other than the Constitution itself and our decisions interpreting that document, including <em>Tausig, </em>he was in error.</p>
    <p id="b716-6" data-blocks='[["BL_716.6",716,[234,1751,1148,306]]]'>The Constitution has vested a grave duty in the Secretary and the failure to carry out what is mandated infects the amendment process with an incurable defect. Four days, two of which are a weekend, are simply not enough time as is evidenced by the fact that only 6 newspapers were able to advertise on or before August 6, 1990.</p>

Without proper advertising, the <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>electorate in 1990 was denied the opportunity to consider the views of those standing for election to the General Assembly at the 1990 general election, never had the opportunity to be advised of their views or attitudes concerning these amendments and, therefore, could not vote for the 1991-1992 General Assembly with those views and attitudes in mind. Accordingly, a critical procedural step in the amendment process was modified, if not entirely omitted, and this defect makes literal compliance with the rest of the section impossible.</p>
    <p id="b717-5" data-blocks='[["BL_717.4",717,[235,844,1150,207]]]'>Since the record clearly demonstrates that grounds exist to support the decree, we cannot interfere with the decision of the Chancellor. Accordingly, the order granting the preliminary injunction must be affirmed.</p>

When a ballot question leaves more questions than answers, or means more or less than it says, such can be as lethal as inadequate notice. The time between initiation of a constitutional amendment and its submission to the voters is designed to prepare and present an understandable question for full discussion. In so important a matter nothing less than full compliance with applicable notice requirement can be acceptable.</p>
