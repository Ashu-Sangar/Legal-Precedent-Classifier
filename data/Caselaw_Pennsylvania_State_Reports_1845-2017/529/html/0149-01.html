    <p id="b254-13" data-blocks='[["BL_254.12",254,[248,1386,1148,417]]]'>This appeal attacks two aspects of the jury instructions given at appellant’s trial under the rubric of counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to object to the charge. He claims that the court gave erroneous instructions on his alibi defense, and that the definition of “reasonable doubt” was defective. The Superior Court, sitting en banc, rejected his claims. <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa-super/386/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 Pa.

Jones, was convicted by a jury of three counts of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime. Following the conviction, newly retained counsel filed post-trial motions. The motions were denied, and appellant received an aggregate sentence of five to ten years’ imprisonment. Appellant’s timely appeal from the judgment of sentence was dismissed by the Superi- or Court for failure to file a brief. Present counsel then filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, alleging that all prior counsel were ineffective and <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>seeking leave to appeal nunc pro tunc. The petition was granted, and this appeal followed. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and we allowed this appeal to consider the jury charge given at appellant’s trial.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[221,577,1152,359]]]'>Appellant’s first claim is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding his alibi defense. He claims that it was error to omit the “even if not wholly believed” language used by this court in <em>Commonwealth v.

A charge which meets this standard would not be taken to mean that by introducing alibi evidence the defense assumed a burden of proof, which, if not met, could provide a basis for a finding of guilt.</blockquote>

    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[248,516,1151,358]]]'>Appellant argues that “[t]his is tantamount to saying that the alibi testimony must satisfy the jurors that the defendant could not possibly have committed the offense.” He further claims that this is the same as telling the jury that the accused must prove himself innocent, setting forth a more demanding standard than is required under <em>Pounds, <a href="/pa/490/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="490 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="1763778" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0621-01">supra.</a></em>

    <p id="b256-9" data-blocks='[["BL_256.8",256,[247,1537,1151,148]]]'>The court was quite clear about where the burden of proof lay, and certainly does not suggest that the defendant must prove himself innocent.</p>
    <p id="b256-10" data-blocks='[["BL_256.9",256,[245,1702,1152,414]]]'>The charge does suggest that an alibi defense must preclude the possibility that the defendant could have committed the offense. That, of course, is the essence of an alibi. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1976), defines “alibi” as follows:, “the plea of having been at the time of the commission ,of an act elsewhere than at the place of commission.” Black’s Law Dictionary, rev. 4th ed. (1968), gives the following definition:</p>

    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[222,841,1152,257]]]'>Thus, in order to constitute an alibi, evidence must preclude the possibility of defendant’s presence at the scene of the crime.

    <p id="b257-7" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[222,1121,1152,152]]]'>We therefore find no error in the trial court’s definition of alibi nor in the omission of the “even if not wholly believed” language of <em>Pounds.</em>

    <p id="b257-8" data-blocks='[["BL_257.7",257,[224,1302,1149,89]]]'>Appellant also objects to the court’s definition of “reasonable doubt.” The court said:</p>

A reasonable doubt must be more than a fanciful doubt, a caprice, a whim or a doubt that you conjure up in your mind in order to avoid the unpleasant task of determining guilt or non-guilt. It is a substantive doubt. It is a real doubt, a doubt of such substance that if it occurs in a matter of importance in your own affairs, it would restrain you from acting---- Do you have a reasonable doubt, a doubt of such substance that if it occurred in a matter of importance in your own affairs it would restrain you from acting.</blockquote>
