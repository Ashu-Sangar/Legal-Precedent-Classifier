The surcharges were consolidated for a non-jury trial before President Judge Albert E. Acker, who was specially designated by this Court to hear the matter. All but one of the surcharges against the Commissioners were dismissed. President Judge Acker entered judgment against the Commissioners in the amount of $203,658.90, an amount representing principal and interest for the purchase of the AT &amp; T system.</p>

Representatives of AT &amp; T contacted Louis Lignelli, the County’s Director of Administration, to discuss the purchase of the leased telephone system and the acquisition of a replacement system known as AT &amp; T System 75. System 75 is an integrated business information management system employing digital switching and computer controls with a wide range of features that enhance operations efficiency.</p>

The expert witnesses who testified at trial <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>generally agreed that System 75 was an excellent system.

A third proposal provided for the installation of System 75, termination charges resulting from early termination of the telephone lease agreements, and relocation of the existing system to a County home facility. The third proposal was accepted with modifications.</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[256,958,1149,519]]]'>Mr. Lignelli testified that he did not contact competitors although he was aware that other companies could supply similar services and equipment. The purchase of System 75 was recommended by Mr. Lignelli because of County personnel’s familiarity with the equipment, as well as the existence of AT &amp; T developmental laboratories for new products and its arrangements to have an AT &amp; T representative on the premises. He expressed a concern for disruption in services if the contract was given to another company.</p>

The third proposal by AT &amp; T included termination charges of $55,225.90. The purchase eventually made by the County was for 349 existing telephones at a price of $73,536.00 which included the termination of the previous lease agreement, 65 new telephones plus installation at $31,392.00, and the purchase of the System 75 plus wiring at $94,412.00, for a total purchase price of $199,140.</p>

No formal action was taken until a meeting of the Commissioners on November 15, 1984 at which they unanimously agreed to purchase the existing telephone system and new, unspecified equipment. Invoices were sent to the County during the period from October 18, 1984 through July 18, 1985 that were signed by individual commissioners. AT &amp; T sent invoices to Washington County for payment on July 26, July 30, and August 2, 1985 that were not signed by the Commissioners. The invoices were questioned by the County Controller, who asked the County Commissioners to explain why the purchase was not bid.</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[207,1223,1154,629]]]'>On November 4, 1985, AT &amp; T brought an action against the County based upon the Service Purchase Agreement. The County admitted entering into the agreement, alleging that the invoices had been approved by the Commissioners but that the Controller had refused to make the payments. Judgment was entered against the County on November 8, 1985 in the amount of $199,141.40. The Controller’s petition to intervene in the action was denied by Judge Rodgers of the Washington County Court of Common Pleas. The County Controller subsequently filed a surcharge for the purchase in the 1985 Washington County Annual Financial Report in the amount of $200,810.74.</p>

Pursuant to 16 P.S. § 1802(a), all contracts for services and personal property in an amount exceeding $4,000.00 must be made by advertising for bids unless specifically exempted. The Commissioners sought to establish that the purchase fell within the exceptions for patented and manufactured or copyrighted products, for contracts made for public utility <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>service under tariffs filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and for contracts involving personal or professional services, 16 P.S. § 1802(h)(3), (4), and (5) respectively.

The amendments limited the amount of a surcharge to actual financial loss absent fraud or collusion. The amendments were enacted on December 17, 1986, but were made retroactive to January, 1978.</p>
    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[255,1293,1151,422]]]'>In their post-trial motion, the Commissioners requested that the surcharge be dismissed or, alternatively, be limited to the actual financial loss sustained by the County. In disposing of the post-trial motions, the trial court acknowledged the passage of the amendments to the surcharge provisions but did not address their application to this case. The trial court noted only that the amendments might have a substantial effect on the outcome of the surcharges.</p>
    <p id="b190-7" data-blocks='[["BL_190.7",190,[253,1749,1151,586]]]'>The Commissioners appealed from the imposition of the surcharge. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court vacated the portion of the trial court’s order relating to the AT &amp; T surcharge and remanded the case for a determination of the actual loss, if any, incurred by the County because of the AT &amp; T purchase. The Commonwealth Court rejected the Commissioner’s argument that the patent exception to the bidding requirements was applicable. The brief of the Commissioners filed before the Commonwealth Court did not raise the other two exceptions discussed by the trial court and were not addressed on appeal for that reason.</p>

      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>The Commonwealth Court held that the December 17, 1986 amendment to 16 P.S. § 1731 limiting liability could not be given retroactive effect because it operated to restrict the citizens’ right to recover damages. The Commissioners asserted that, prior to its amendment, 16 P.S. § 1731 was violative of the Equal Protection clause because similar surcharge provisions governing other municipal officials limited liability to actual loss. Noting that the equal protection argument had not been raised by the Commissioners until the filing of post-trial motions and that the trial court had found it untimely, the Commonwealth Court addressed the argument because the trial court had done so. The Commonwealth Court accepted the argument and remanded the matter for that reason.</p>
    <p id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[223,1052,1154,684]]]'>The Commissioners assert that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that the purchase of the AT &amp; T system did not fall within the patent exception to the bidding requirements. In concluding that the public bidding exception in 16 P.S. § 1802(h)(3) was inapplicable to the AT &amp; T contract, the Commonwealth Court focused its inquiry on whether the product was so patented as to eliminate competition in its manufacture and to render public bidding futile. Noting that the trial court had found the testimony of witnesses indicating that comparable systems were available to be credible, the Commonwealth Court found that the AT &amp; T system was not an item that was so patented as to eliminate competitive bidding.</p>

As before, it does not permit defenses based on a lack of favoritism or personal gain, a good faith belief that the bidding requirements did not apply, or advice of counsel. The liability imposed under the amendments is unchanged. It is only the damages that may be recovered that has changed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The retroactive amendments are applicable to the surcharge imposed in this case. For this reason, we need not address the Commissioners’ arguments based upon an equal protection claim, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit.</p>

Thomas Hessler, a witness for the Controller, testified that it was his belief that the AT &amp; T system was not the lowest priced, best system on the market at that time.</p>
    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[219,1336,1152,688]]]'>No evidence was introduced, however, as to actual loss because the County Controller was not required to establish financial loss prior to the retroactive amendments. The trial court concluded that under the prior statute, testimony concerning whether the County benefited from the purchase or whether the purchase was a bargain was irrelevant because a loss was presumed where the bidding provisions are not followed. Although the testimony of Mr. Lignelli amply supports the County Commissioners’ position that no financial loss was sustained by the County, the change in the law resulting from the retroactive amendments requires us to provide the parties with the opportunity to submit evidence in support of their respective positions.</p>

We find that the County Controller’s argument that the retroactive amendments should not be applied because the evidence demonstrates constructive fraud to be totally without merit. The evidence simply does not lend itself to that characterization. Accordingly, we will not address the question of whether a showing of constructive fraud would be sufficient to warrant imposition of damages in the entire amount of the contract.</p>
