The appellee, following his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, was first sentenced in August of 1984, to a term of three and one-half to seven years of incarceration. The Honorable Judge Gilfert M. Mihalich of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County imposed the judgment <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>of sentence. Following a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence, the Superior Court remanded for resentencing, holding that the sentencing court had erred in relying upon a one to two year sentence enhancement for the use of a deadly weapon, which was prescribed by a statute not yet in effect at the time of appellee’s criminal offense. Upon remand, a second sentencing hearing was held before Judge Mihalich, commencing at 9:30 a.m. on April 26, 1986. During this proceeding appellee’s counsel argued that the intent of the Superior Court’s decision was for the trial court to impose a two and one-half to five year term of incarceration for the voluntary manslaughter conviction. The Commonwealth responded by emphasizing the many factors considered by the court in imposing its original sentence, aside from the deadly weapons enhancement, and argued to the court that “... there is reason to keep the sentence as you originally gave it, and at least, Your Honor, we would ask that you resentence no lower than the two and a half to five.” N.T., April 29, 1986, at 4.</p>

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the sentence first imposed by the trial court on April 29, 1986, was not illegal. No statute precluded the imposition of a sentence of two and one-half to five years. Thus, we must reach beyond our decision in <em>Jones </em>to resolve the matter before us. Accordingly, we first return to <em>U.S. v. DiFrancesco </em>for a closer examination. There, the defendant was convicted of federal racketeering offenses and sentenced as a dangerous special offender under <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203576" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 3576">18 U.S.C. § 3576</a> to two ten-year prison terms to be served concurrently with a nine year sentence imposed in an unrelated federal trial. The government appealed, arguing <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>that the district court had abused its discretion in sentencing the defendant to only one additional year of incarceration under the dangerous offender statute. The court of appeals dismissed the government’s appeal on double jeopardy grounds. <em>U.S. v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/f2d/604/0769-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="604 F.2d 769" data-case-ids="22606" data-case-paths="/f2d/604/0769-01">604 F.2d 769</a> (2d Cir.1979).

    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[198,792,1154,1048]]]'>In <em>DiFrancesco </em>the Court noted that the double jeopardy clause is designed to preserve the finality of judgments and to prevent the State from making "... repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” <em><a href="/f2d/604/0769-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="604 F.2d 769" data-case-ids="22606" data-case-paths="/f2d/604/0769-01">Id.</a> </em>(citations omitted). Further, although the guarantee against double jeopardy protects against multiple punishments for the same offense, the Court declined to hold that a criminal sentence has the qualities of constitutional finality and conclusiveness that have been accorded a verdict of acquittal. The Court recognized that historically, a criminal sentence has never carried such a high level of finality: “This accounts for the established practice in the federal courts that the sentencing judge may recall the defendant and increase his sentence, at least (and we venture no comment as to this limitation) so long as he has not yet begun to serve that sentence.” <em><a href="/f2d/604/0769-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="604 F.2d 769" data-case-ids="22606" data-case-paths="/f2d/604/0769-01">Id.</a> </em><a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">449 U.S. at 134</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">101 S.Ct. at 435</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We recognize the Commonwealth’s argument that because the appellee had not left the courthouse at the time he was recalled for resentencing, coupled with the fact that his sentence had not yet been reduced to writing, appellee had not “begun to serve” his sentence at the time the trial court increased the term of his sentence. In <em>DiFrancesco </em>the Supreme Court declined to comment on this purported limitation to the protections of the double jeopardy clause. We decline to adopt a "bright line” rule which would recognize constitutional finality in a sentence only upon the formal transfer of an individual from the jurisdiction of the courts to executive custody. At the time the appellee was sentenced to a two and one-half to five year term of incarceration by Judge Mihalich, the appellee began to serve <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>that sentence. The language used by trial courts in imposing criminal sentences supports our conclusion. In the case <em>sub judice </em>the court announced that "It’s the sentence of this Court that the defendant pay the costs of prosecution, and is committed to the Bureau of Corrections____ Stand committed.” N.T., April 29, 1986, at 5-6. Further, the reality of the situation was that, upon the close of the sentencing proceeding, the appellee was not free to go, but was taken immediately by the authorities for transport to a correctional facility. Thus, at least for the purposes of the double jeopardy clause, appellee had begun to serve his sentence of two and one-half to five years at the close of the sentencing proceeding.

Accordingly, Judge Mihalich’s imposition on remand of three and one-half to seven years for voluntary manslaughter without enhancement due to the use of a deadly weapon, was consistent with his original intent in sentencing Kunish for this crime. Judge Mihalich’s many references to the original sentence imposed against Kunish further support this conclusion.
