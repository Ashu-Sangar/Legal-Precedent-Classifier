The issue is whether the cost of custodial medical and nursing care required because of the medical condition caused by accident injuries is an allowable expense under a no-fault auto insurance policy. The trial court held that the insurer, Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (PNI), was liable for the cost of the victim’s custodial care under section 103 of <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>the No-Fault Act, 40 P.S. § 1009.103, even though the victim was no longer a candidate for rehabilitation.

Mr. Fertig suffered serious spinal injuries and was rendered quadriplegic.

PNI’s theory was that Mr. Fertig was receiving only custodial care at the home rather than medical or rehabilitative treatment. PNI argued that <em>Reilly by Reilly v.

PNI presented the testimony of two physicians and the director of physical therapy services at Mr. Fertig’s nursing home, who all agreed that he had reached the point where he was no longer a candidate for physical therapy and was receiving only maintenance and supportive care. Nevertheless, one of the doctors testified that Mr. Fertig needed periodic review of his bladder and bowel disfunctions, that he required skilled nursing care or his condition could regress, and that even though he was not a candidate for rehabilitation he needed “medical care and nursing care because of his condition.” The trial court <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>found that Mr. Fertig’s care at the nursing home was <em>“because of his medical </em>condition,” slip op. at 2 (emphasis in original), concluded that such care was the obligation of a no-fault insurer, and ordered PNI to pay all of Mr. Fertig’s charges at the nursing home.</p>

We granted allocatur to consider whether such custodial care might be “medical care” payable by the insurer as an allowable expense under 40 P.S. § 1009.103, even though <em>Reilly </em>held it was not the responsibility of the insurer because it was not “rehabilitation” under § 103.</p>
    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[218,1291,1151,735]]]'>Appellee PNI, of course, argues that <em>Reilly </em>controls this case, and that the quoted holding should not be limited. Hence, PNI claims that Mr. Fertig’s care, which was custodial in nature, is not recoverable under the No-Fault Act, and the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed. Appellant, on the other hand, argues that the trial court’s finding that Mr. Fertig’s care, necessary <em>“because of his medical condition,” </em>is a finding that the care was not custodial but was “professional medical treatment and care” which is recoverable as an allowable expense. Finally, amicus curiae, the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association, argues that custodial care, despite the language of <em>Reilly, </em>should be recoverable if it is necessary because of accident injuries.</p>

    <p id="b152-3" data-blocks='[["BL_152.3",152,[235,312,1151,1001]]]'>
      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>Due to the reliance placed thereon, it is important to understand the <em>Reilly </em>decision and the context in which this court stated that custodial care was not recoverable under the No-Fault Act. Reilly was a minor who was struck by an automobile after he alighted from a SEPTA bus. He suffered widespread and permanent injuries which rendered him a quadriplegic. By his parents, he sued SEPTA, the bus driver, and the owner and driver of the automobile which struck him. One of the issues in the case was whether the services provided to Reilly at the institution where he was permanently confined in a wheelchair were custodial or rehabilitative in nature. The trial court’s jury charge, reviewed in its entirety, revealed that the jury was properly instructed that it could accept or reject the evidence as to Reilly’s physical needs and that the services were custodial in nature, and that if the jury found the services to be custodial, it should award damages for the services. The jury awarded damages against SEPTA, the bus driver, and the driver of the car.</p>
    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[232,1333,1153,523]]]'>On appeal, the issue was whether or not the trial court had erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that Reilly’s institutional care was custodial rather than rehabilitative and thus recoverable from the tortfeasors rather than his no-fault insurer. This court held that the Superior Court had erred, misshaping and misreading the record, in holding that the trial judge had improperly usurped the jury’s function in finding the care to be custodial. In fact, the trial court’s charge had properly submitted the issue to the jury-</p>
    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[233,1874,1150,463]],["BL_153.1",153,[223,295,1153,744]]]'>Two significant factors distinguish <em>Reilly </em>from this case. First, the precise issue in <em>Reilly </em>was a challenge to the jury charge, questioning whether it permitted the jury sufficient latitude to determine whether Reilly’s care was custodial or rehabilitative. A more important distinction, closely related to the first, is that the issue in <em>Reilly </em>was presented simply as a dichotomy under the statutory definition of “medical and vocational rehabilitation services”: was Reilly’s care rehabilitative or was it not? If it was not rehabilitative but <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>only custodial, then it was not recoverable as “medical and vocational rehabilitation services.” It was never suggested that custodial, non-rehabilitative care might nonetheless be “medical care” recoverable from a no-fault insurer as another type of allowable expense, namely “professional medical treatment and care.” That alternative was not argued, nor was it considered or decided by this court. In short, the <em>Reilly </em>court did not hold that custodial care could not be “professional medical treatment and care,” one type of allowable expense under § 103, but only that custodial care was not “medical and vocational rehabilitation services,” a second type of allowable expense under § 103. The <em>Reilly </em>decision, therefore, does not provide authority for the Superior Court’s disposition of this case.</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[223,1064,1151,526]]]'>The emphasis placed on the term “custodial” by the Superior Court and by appellee is misleading, despite the use of the term in the <em>Reilly </em>opinion of this court. The term is not used in the No-Fault Act, nor in appellee’s insurance policy with Mr. Fertig, nor in the Pennsylvania Code regulations pertaining to no-fault insurance. In order to determine Mr. Fertig’s entitlement to the challenged expenses for nursing home accommodations, we must examine the No-Fault Act and the insurance policy issued by PNI to Mr. Fertig pursuant to the act.</p>

The purpose of the No-Fault Act was to establish “a Statewide system of prompt and <em>adequate </em>basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims____” Moreover, it was the intent of the legislature to guarantee that accident victims “receive prompt and <em>comprehensive </em>professional treatment.” 40 P.S. §§ 1009.102(b) and 1009.102(a)(9)(A) (emphasis added). With these principles in mind, we examine the statute to determine Mr. Fertig’s entitlement to payment for the nursing home accommodations.</p>
    <p id="b154-8" data-blocks='[["BL_154.6",154,[240,1966,1149,363]],["BL_155.1",155,[214,316,1150,250]]]'>It is readily apparent from the statute that the cost of accommodations is covered if the accommodations are necessary for the provision of either “professional medical treatment and care” or “medical and vocational rehabilitation services.” “Allowable expense means reasonable charges incurred for ... reasonably needed and used products, services, <em>and accommodations for: </em>(A) professional <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>medical treatment and care; [and] (C) medical and vocational rehabilitation services____” 40 P.S. § 1009.103 (emphasis added).

It is argued, however, that entitlement for the cost of “professional medical treatment and care” may include medically necessary nursing services even if the services may be characterized as custodial. We agree. Title 1, Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) states: “Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” What is excluded under one section of a statute may be included under another provision of the same statute, and it is clear that allowance for “medical care” entitles an accident victim to additional and different payments than those provided under the allowance for “rehabilitation services.”</p>

By contrast, the statute does not define “professional medical treatment and care.” Nevertheless, appellee PNI provides a useful definition in its standard no-fault insurance policy. The PNI policy, after defining “medical and vocational rehabilitation services” in terms identical to the statute, also states that the policy covers “reasonable charges incurred for necessary products, services and <em>accommodations </em>for professional medical treatment and care” and defines the latter phrase as follows: “this includes, but is not limited to, (1) <em>medical </em>and dental <em>services; </em>(2) prosthetic devices; (3) ambulance; [and] (4) hospital and <em>professional nursing services for </em>diagnosis, <em>care, and </em>recovery____” (Emphasis added.)
