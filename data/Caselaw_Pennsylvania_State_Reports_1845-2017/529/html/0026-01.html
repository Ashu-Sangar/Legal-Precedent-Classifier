However, both appellants use different rationales to support their interpre<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>tations. Appellant Mrs. Crouse argues first that under the original version of Act 101, there was no indication that the cause of death was required to be directly related to the duties in question. Mrs. Crouse asserts that under the amended version of Act 101, causation is required but only in regard to an injury causing death. Hence Mrs. Crouse argues that the phrase “sustained in the performance of ... duties” was not intended to supplant the phrase “killed in the performance of duties” but rather to indicate that the temporal relation between death and the performance of duties is of no consequence. That is, Mrs. Crouse suggests that under the original Act eligibility would arise as long as the decedent died <em>while on duty </em>but that under the amended Act, <em>“it doesn’t matter when the death occurs </em>so long as it resulted from injuries ‘sustained in the performance of duties.’ ” Appellant’s Brief at p. 7 (emphasis added). Mrs. Crouse supports her claim by noting that the retroactivity clause of Act 101 was implemented to accommodate a claimant whose decedent was injured prior to, but died after, the effective date of the 1981 amendment to Act 101. Accordingly, Mrs. Crouse contends that she is entitled to the benefits provided by Act 101 since her husband suffered a fatal injury, <em>i.e., </em>a heart attack, while on duty.</p>

To support its interpretation, the Township compares the dictionary definition of “result” (indicating causation) with that of “sustain” (indicating the suffering of a loss) to conclude there is no basis for finding a second causal relation in Act 101. <em>Citing, </em>Webster’s New Riverside Dictionary (1984). The Township strenuously argues that the true intent of the legislature in using the phrase “sustained in the performance ... of duties” was to parallel the eligibility language of the Worker’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 411, which provides benefits for injuries “arising in the course of employment.” The Township then suggests that because the phrase “arising in the course of employment” has never been construed as requir<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>ing a causal relation, a similar construction should be given to the phrase “sustained in the performance of ... duties.” Accordingly, the Township argues that it is entitled to relief because Mr. Ehrman was properly engaged in his duties as a fireman when he suffered an injury <em>{i.e., </em>heart attack) cognizable under the Act, and that as a direct result thereof, he died.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[241,672,1152,683]]]'>The Department counters the appellant’s interpretation by arguing that the use of the phrase “sustained in the performance of ... duties” adds a second causal element which must be satisfied before eligibility can accrue. The Department contends that this is the only logical interpretation which can be given to the Act because accepting appellants’ construction would yield the unreasonable result that all firefighters who die while on duty, without regard to the factors which prompt death, could receive benefits. For the following reasons we find that the interpretation suggested by the Department is correct and that eligibility under Act 101 is premised upon a causal relation between the injury sustained and the duty performed.</p>

Our focal point here is the Act’s eligibility language, specifically the phrase “dying ... as the direct result of injuries sustained in the performance of ... duties.” A plain reading of this language indicates that Act 101 comprises two distinct causal elements that a claimant must prove to establish eligibility. First there must be an injury which would not have occurred but for the performance of duty-related activity. Second, the injury must cause death. The phrase “sustained in the performance of ... duties,” as used in this context, should be interpreted to mean that something from the decedent’s environment while on duty must precipitate the injury which causes death. The application of this interpretation depends upon the facts presented. If the decedent suffered a wholly unanticipated injury a claimant must show that the stimulus of his decedent’s injury was initiated by the decedent’s on-duty activities. However, if the injury suffered was related to a preexisting condition, the claimant must <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>prove that the performance of duties exacerbated the condition to the extent that death was not a mere coincidence. <em>See, e.g., Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board v.

Instead, the legislature used the word “sustained.” The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed.) defines sustain as to “undergo, experience, or suffer.” There is no element of causation in any of these words. Thus, I would interpret the phrase “sustained in the performance of their duties,” to mean any injury suffered during the performance of their duties. Thus, the claimants herein are entitled to recover death benefits pursuant to Act 101, as the deaths resulted from injuries suffered during the performance of the decedents’ duties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
