The issue is whether the Mechanics’ Lien Law at 49 P.S. § 1306(b) (“Apportionment of Claims”) precludes the enforcement of liens filed against multiple units of a new condominium where the amount claimed in each lien represents the total claim for all work done on all the common <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>elements and separate units. The lower courts held that it does.</p>

In May, 1987, it entered a contract with appellee Moss Creek, Inc., a developer, to build a new condominium. In the course of the contract, three of the eight units were sold, and Metco received payments in return for releases as to any mechanics’ liens filed or pending. Metco later filed mechanics’ liens against the five remaining units, which were owned by the two appellees in this case. The amount of each lien was stated as $322,512.00, the entire amount Metco claimed to be due on the contract, involving eight condominium units and common elements. The amount of the lien had no direct relation to the work done or materials supplied on the five units not subject to release from mechanics’ liens.</p>

Appellees filed preliminary objections which led the trial court to strike the lien claims and the complaints for judgment. The court held that Metco’s failure to apportion its claim to reflect the value of work done and materials provided for each separate unit subject to the lien was a fatal defect.

Super. 482" data-case-ids="648150" data-case-paths="/pa-super/350/0482-01">350 Pa.Super. 482</a>, <a href="/pa-super/350/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="350 Pa.

There the Superior Court held that a row of townhouses is not a “single residential plant” within the meaning of section 1306(b). It therefore invalidated a single lien which had been filed against the entire project. The <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>
      <em>Meyers Plumbing </em>case rested on the statutory language and several trial court decisions interpreting the word “plant.”</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[215,457,1151,415]]]'>In this case, the Superior Court held that the condominium development was not a single residential plant. It next held that the separate liens filed against the individual units were not legally perfected under section 1306(b) because they were not apportioned. The court concluded that the separate provision concerning condominium liens, 68 Pa.C.S. § 3409(b), did not apply because it presumed the existence of a validly lodged lien.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[215,889,1151,203]]]'>The Superior Court was in error. The remedy of invalidating a mechanics’ lien should only be resorted to under a clear statutory mandate or in cases of clear necessity, neither of which is present here.</p>

The statutory section, then, is to be construed as an exception to the more general rule of 49 P.S. § 1306(b), which normally requires that lien claims “for work upon several different improvements which do not form all or part of a single business or residential plant,” must be filed separately “with respect to each such improvement, with the amount of each claim determined by apportionment of the total debt to the several improvements.” Thus it was proper, under 68 Pa.C.S. § 3409(b), to file “a lien ... against two or more units,” whereupon, to release the claim, “the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit____ The amount of the payment must be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner’s common expense liability bears to the common <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien.” This provision from the Uniform Condominium Act clearly permits one lien to be filed against multiple units without apportionment among the units; payment in release of the several claims contemplates apportionment at the time of release, not at the time of filing the lien. Thus, the Superior Court erred in concluding that the unapportioned claims against multiple units were prohibited by the Mechanics’ Lien Law, 49 P.S. § 1306(b).</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[254,781,1151,633]]]'>Even if we did not interpret 68 Pa.C.S. § 3409(b) as permitting an unapportioned mechanics’ lien claim to be filed against multiple condominium units, the prohibition of 49 P.S. § 1306(b) does not control this case. That provision prohibits an unapportioned claim “for work upon several different improvements <em>which do not form all or part of a single business or residential plant” </em>Within the terms of the statute, a condominium development is a “single residential plant,” as condominiums, in contrast to other forms of multiple housing, have legal characteristics which make pre-filing apportionment of claims impracticable if not impossible.</p>

      <em>Meyers Plumbing, supra, </em>relied on by the trial court and the Superior Court to support the conclusion that this condominium was not a “single residential plant,” held that a 42-unit townhouse project, consisting of six- and eight-unit buildings was not a single “plant.” <em>Meyers, </em>in turn, followed earlier cases holding that such housing projects as 12 two-story townhouses, three separate dwelling houses, a double house with a continuous roof, and a group of 20 houses on separate lots did not qualify as single “plants.” <em>Meyers </em>is an inappropriate precedent for determining whether a <em>condominium </em>constitutes a “single residential plant.”</p>

These distinctive characteristics of condominium ownership justify the designation of a condominium as a “single residential plant,” making the apportionment requirement of 49 P.S. § 1306(b) inapplicable to mechanics’ liens filed against condominiums. The reason is that common ownership of shared areas makes apportionment impossible at the time of filing some mechanics’ liens against condominiums. The recording of a “declaration of condominium” is the mechanism whereby a condominium is created and the proportional share of each <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>unit is designated, and recording may not take place unless the condominium is substantially completed, as it was in this case. 68 Pa.C.S. §§ 3201-08. Until that time, it would be impossible to apportion a mechanics’ lien claim among the various units. Thus, the Superior Court erred in concluding that the unapportioned claims against multiple units were prohibited by 49 P.S. § 1306(b), because condominiums are excluded as “single residential plants.”</p>
