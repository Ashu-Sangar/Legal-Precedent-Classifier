Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.

Indeed, after the defense had objected to the first two blacks being stricken, the trial judge suggested that if the challenge were to be raised again upon completion of the <em>voir dire </em>process, he would request the prosecutor to explain his reasons for exercising his peremptory challenges. At the end of the <em>voir , dire, </em>with 5 of 6 challenges striking blacks from the panel, the trial judge, notwithstanding, inexplicably refused to elicit an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, the trial court dismissed defense counsel’s motions as “preposterous.” However, pursuant to <em>Batson, </em>by failing to advance a racially neutral explanation, the prosecutor failed to carry his burden of proof as required and the resulting verdict was thereby “tainted.”</p>

Instantly, the Superior Court properly vacated the judgment of sentence imposed by the trial court as that court’s application of the <em>Batson </em>rule placed upon the defendant the unreasonable requirement that he read the prosecutor’s mind and prove his ill motives. As a consequence, the defendant suffered a systematic deprivation of his right to a fair trial. In this matter, at a minimum, sufficient exclusion occurred to require the prosecutor to disclose his “non-discriminatory” reasons.
