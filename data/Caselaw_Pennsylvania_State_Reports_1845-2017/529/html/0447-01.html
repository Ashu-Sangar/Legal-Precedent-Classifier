      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>The issue raised by this appeal is whether the error of the Civil Service Commission in placing the burden of proof upon an employee to prove a continuing disability during a hearing involving the termination of disability benefits requires that the case be remanded for new findings as to whether his employer has sustained what was actually its burden of proof. By dismissing this appeal as an improvident grant, the majority has upheld a determination that was reached by requiring the wrong party to carry the burden of proof.</p>

Should the employee file an appeal with the Civil Service Commission within thirty (30) days of such refusal to return to work, his absence from work for the period between the date of filing such appeal and the date a decision thereon is entered by the Commission shall be charged against accrued sick leave, vacation leave or holiday compensatory time.

In this regard, I would note that the employer’s medical experts testified that appellant did suffer from pain and that appellant faced some limitations with respect to lifting and bending. The limited duty position that was available to the appellant involved repeated stair climbing and lengthy periods of sitting. As the employer's evidence did not address appellant’s ability to perform such physical functions, it is clear that the employer did not meet its burden of proving that appellant is no longer totally disabled.</p>
