The instruction given in this case served to keep the jury focused on the controlling issue of whether the Commonwealth met its burden of proof, without introducing misleading or confusing considerations.</p>

The defendant has offered evidence to show that he was not present at the crime but rather was at (-). You should consider this evidence along with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and that the defendant himself committed (or took part in committing) it. The defendant's evidence that he was not present, either by itself or together with other evidence, may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt in your minds. If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt you must find him not guilty.</blockquote>

We find no merit in the additional claim raised by appellant that prejudice arose from the introduction of evidence that a window was broken at the residence of William Davis ten days after the instant assault and that, while police were at the Davis residence to investigate the broken window, Davis mentioned appellant’s name and <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>address. This evidence was very brief in nature and was merely explanatory of events which guided police in their efforts to locate and arrest appellant for the present offenses. In comparison to the present offenses, the breaking of a window was petty in nature and arguably would not have affected the jury’s deliberations even if jurors drew the conclusion that appellant broke the window. Nevertheless, the trial court promptly and thoroughly instructed the jury to disregard evidence regarding the broken window. Defense counsel made no objection to the instruction and did not request a mistrial. Any possible prejudice was cured by the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority has determined that the court's instruction, when viewed as a whole, fully conveyed to the jury that a failure by the defense to prove alibi was not to be construed as evidence of guilt.
