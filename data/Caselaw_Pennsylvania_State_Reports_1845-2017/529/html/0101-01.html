Guthridge, traveled together by car to two taverns in Curwensville, Pennsylvania. At the taverns, appellant and Guthridge consumed beer. Later, while driving himself and Guthridge home at approximately 2:30 a.m., appellant struck a parked car. Appellant and Guthridge suffered injuries in the collision and were transported to a hospital. At the hospital, a state police trooper requested that appellant consent to a determination of his blood alcohol level. Appellant gave his. consent, and, at 4:20 a.m., a blood sample was taken. The sample was forwarded to a crime laboratory for analysis. Appellant’s blood alcohol level proved to be 0.108%.</p>

The first provision, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(1), makes it an offense to drive “under the influence of alcohol to a degree which renders the person incapable of safe driving.” At trial, appellant was acquitted on this charge. Appellant was found guilty, however, of a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(4), which provides:</p>

See generally <em>Commonwealth v. Gonzalez, </em><a href="/pa/519/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="519 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1813572" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0116-01">519 Pa. 116</a>, 125-34, <a href="/pa/519/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="519 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1813572" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0116-01">546 A.2d 26</a>, 30-35 (1988) (an opinion discussing the difficulty of “relating back” blood alcohol test results to the time of driving). In particular, appellant argues that expert testimony adduced by the Commonwealth on the issue of blood alcohol content was sufficiently ambiguous as to leave open to speculation the question of his blood alcohol content while driving. Upon the record presented, we agree that the evidence of appellant’s blood alcohol level was insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol level was equal to or greater than 0.10% while driving.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[222,1367,1153,732]]]'>In 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(4), supra, it is made an offense to drive a vehicle <em>while </em>one’s blood alcohol content is 0.10% or greater. In contrast, we note that the legislatures of certain other states have enacted statutes making it an offense to drive with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% “as shown by” or “as determined by” a blood alcohol test administered within a specified time <em>after </em>driving has ceased. See generally <em>People v. Mertz, </em><a href="/ny-2d/68/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="68 N.Y.2d 136" data-case-ids="2347181" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/68/0136-01">68 N.Y.2d 136</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=506%20N.Y.S.2d%20290" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="506 N.Y.S.2d 290">506 N.Y.S.2d 290</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=497%20N.E.2d%20657" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="497 N.E.2d 657">497 N.E.2d 657</a> (1986) (compilation of various states’ statutes on drunk driving). Under such statutes, the facts of the present case might readily support a conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Our statute, however, is more limited in its focus. It makes one’s blood alcohol content <em>while </em>driving the pivotal issue.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.3",209,[220,306,1153,686]]]'>
      <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>The legislature has provided that blood tests conducted after suspected drunk drivers have been stopped will be used as evidence of the suspects’ blood alcohol contents while driving. See generally 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547 (chemical testing to determine amount of alcohol). In cases where test results show levels of alcohol significantly above 0.10% and where blood samples have been obtained soon after suspects have been driving, there is a very strong inference that blood alcohol levels were in the prohibited range while driving. However, where, as in the present case, the blood test result barely exceeded the 0.10% level and the lapse of time between driving and the taking of the blood sample was significant, the inference of guilt is weakened.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[217,1010,1154,1335]],["BL_210.1",210,[225,297,1147,88]]]'>The blood test in this case was not performed until approximately one hour and fifty minutes after appellant’s accident. It revealed a blood alcohol content that was barely above the 0.10% level, i.e., 0.108%. The Commonwealth introduced testimony from the physician who drew the blood sample for analysis. He testified that a person’s blood alcohol level fluctuates with the passage of time, such that the level gradually rises after drinks have been consumed until a peak is reached roughly one hour after drinking has ceased, and that, thereafter, the level declines. He stated also that alcohol has no effect until it is absorbed into the bloodstream, which normally takes thirty to ninety minutes. He gave his opinion that, at 4:20 a.m. when the blood sample was drawn, the alcohol concentration in appellant’s blood was probably declining. On cross-examination, however, the physician testified that the alcohol concentration may have peaked between the time of the accident and the time when the blood sample was drawn. He was not able to offer any opinion as to what the alcohol level was at the time of the accident. In short, there was no evidence upon which the physician could offer an opinion as to whether appellant’s blood alcohol level was greater than or equal to 0.10% at the time of the accident. The physician further testified that if appellant’s drinking had occurred just five or ten minutes before the accident, then there <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>would have been no alcohol in his bloodstream when the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[223,415,1150,359]]]'>The unlikelihood that appellant’s drinking occurred just five or ten minutes before the accident is apparent, however, considering that appellant consumed beer at two different taverns on the night of the accident. Also, the accident occurred at a location a number of miles away from the taverns, making it unlikely that appellant could have arrived there in such a short time.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[218,803,1153,626]]]'>Appellant did not testify at trial. Guthridge testified, however, that at each of the two taverns that she and appellant visited on the night of the accident appellant consumed at least one beer. Guthridge was seriously injured in the accident and testified that she did not recall whether appellant had more than one beer at each tavern. Nor did she recall at what times she and appellant arrived at or departed from the taverns, or even roughly how long they were there. Aside from Guthridge’s testimony, there is nothing in the record that sheds light upon the quantity or timing of appellant’s consumption of alcohol on the night of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[216,1460,1151,310]]]'>Appellant argues, based upon testimony of the physician who testified for the Commonwealth, that his blood alcohol level may have peaked sometime after the accident but before the blood test was performed. In addition, he argues that there is no evidence that his blood alcohol level was equal to or above 0.10% at the time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[214,1793,1149,311]]]'>We agree that the record left the jury free to engage in speculation as to whether appellant’s blood alcohol level was at or above 0.10% at the critical time.
