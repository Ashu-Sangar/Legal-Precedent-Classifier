Thus, while a jury may judge an adult harshly who omits details of a disturbing incident, there is no reason to think a jury will not be sensitive to the fact that a child relating the event may not be as specific as the adult would be.

Today, the majority completely rules out the use of expert testimony to aid a jury in understanding a subject which is shrouded in myth and shame and about which the average citizen/juror knows little or nothing. To add insult to injury, the majority supports its holding atop a fragile house of cards consisting of the writings of various “authorities” whose studies and opinions carry only as much legal weight as any other untested authority who can be found to espouse opinions that are in direct opposition to the “authorities” cited. It is anomalous, in fact, that the majority uses experts to convince the legal community of its position due to the legal community’s ignorance and yet <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>concludes that such information is a matter of common knowledge to the average juror.</p>

The issue raised by the cross-appellant, Neil F. Dunkle, is whether Dunkle waived his objection to the admission of evidence of his prior misconduct with the victim by failing to object to it during trial on the basis of remoteness and on the basis that the prior misconduct did not constitute a continuous course of conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> I shall address these issues seriatim.</p>

The charges arose out of an incident occurring in April of 1983, involving Dunkle’s sexual assault upon his fourteen year old stepdaughter as she was taking a shower. Following a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County, Dunkle was found guilty of indecent assault, corruption of minors and criminal attempt to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was acquitted of the charge of rape. The trial court denied Dunkle’s post-verdict motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial. Dunkle was sentenced to concurrent sentences of imprisonment totalling two to four years.</p>

In <em>Davis </em>we did not overrule <em>Baldwin. </em>The expert testimony in <em>Davis </em>and in <em>Seese </em>specifically involved statements about the propensity of sexual abuse victims to tell the truth. The court in <em>Baldwin </em>did not have before it such expert testimony. Thus, there is no statement in the <em>Baldwin </em>case which precludes such testimony.

The majority points out that the expert witness herein was not a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Maj. op. at 171. Her lack of a professional degree has absolutely no bearing upon her qualification as an expert witness. In this Commonwealth, there is a liberal standard for the qualification of an expert witness, i.e., “if a witness has any reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge on the subject matter under investigation he may testify and the weight to be given to his evidence is for the [fact finder]." <em>Commonwealth v. Gonzalez, </em><a href="/pa/519/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="519 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1813572" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0116-01">519 Pa. 116</a>, 128, <a href="/pa/519/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="519 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1813572" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0116-01">546 A.2d 26</a>, 31 (1988) (plurality opinion).

The expert witness herein, based upon her background, training and extensive experience working with the victims of child sexual abuse, was clearly qualified to state what she had observed regarding the behavioral characteristics of such victims, and the trial court did not err in qualifying her as an expert witness.

The majority herein challenges the testimony relating to the general behavioral characteristics of the victims of child sexual abuse on the basis of the <em>"Frye " </em>standard, which was first set forth in <em>Frye v.

The standard from <em>United States v. Downing </em>now known as the <em>Downing </em>standard, focuses on the scientific methodology used in generating the evidence to determine if it can be accepted as reliable by the court even if the evidence has not received widespread acceptance in the relevant scientific community. <em>See Rubanick v.

(urging case by case review rather than the establishment of blanket prohibitions on such evidence so as not to “abandon the child in the courtroom”). Clearly, in the case sub judice, the scientific methodology employed in gathering information about the behavioral characteristics of the victims of child sexual abuse was beyond reproach as the expert witness testified to behavioral characteristics she had personally observed in over 500 such victims. Although the so-called “laundry list” of characteristics may not be sufficiently specific to the victims of child sexual abuse to satisfy the majority herein, no one has disputed the fact that these characteristics <em>do </em>exist and <em>have </em>been observed in such victims.</p>
