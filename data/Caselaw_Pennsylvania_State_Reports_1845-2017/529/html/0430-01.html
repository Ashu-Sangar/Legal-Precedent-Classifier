On April 15, 1987, appellant instituted suit under the Wage Payment and Collection Law (WPCL), 43 P.S. § 260.1 <em>et seq., </em>to recover unpaid back wages from the officers of the corporation. On March 1, 1989, the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Robert M. Hanak, appellee, finding that he was not liable under the WPCL as secretary of McClure, in that he was a “non-functioning” officer of the corporation, and therefore, was not included within the class of those intended to be held liable under the WPCL for nonpayment of wages. This order was affirmed by the Superior Court on January 10, 1990.</p>

The statutory language of 43 P.S. § 260.2a is clear and unambiguous. Hence, it was improper to delve into the purposes behind the WPCL. In accordance with the plain meaning of the statute, a corporate officer is an “employer” within the meaning of the WPCL and is, therefore, subject to personal liability for nonpayment of wages. Consequently, as secretary of McClure, appellee is an officer of the corporation <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>and an “employer” for purposes of the statute, and is therefore, subject to personal liability for appellant’s unpaid wages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Sadly, the judicial branch of government is now getting into the business of legislating.</p>
