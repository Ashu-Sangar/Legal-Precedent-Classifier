For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that “Caller*ID” violates our Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 P.C.S. §§ 5701-5781, and hence cannot now be offered in Pennsylvania.

PUC No. 1, proposing that various new services be added to its tariff, including the offering of the optional service known as Caller*ID. Caller*ID allows a telephone subscriber to identify and record the telephone number from which a call is being made, including private and unlisted numbers, through the use of a device supplied to customers which displays that number and then stores it for future retrieval.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Moreover, the AU determined that, whether or not Caller*ID service was deemed violative of the Wiretap Act, it was not in the public <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>interest to offer Caller*ID without a blocking option. The AU found that numerous groups and individuals who require privacy in making calls in certain instances would be threatened by unblockable Caller*ID. The AU also found that the implementation of a blocking option would not diminish the value of Caller*ID in responding to annoying calls, particularly when the benefits of the service were considered along with other Bell services such as Call*Trace.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The three to one decision determined that Caller*ID blocking could only be provided to non-profit domestic abuse shelters and their staffs, law enforcement agencies, and individuals “certified” by law enforcement officials as requiring Caller* ID blocking to “mitigate the risk of personal injury.” Caller*ID blocking would not be made generally available to any other individuals.</p>

On December 8, 1989, the OCA and the PCADV filed a Joint Application for Partial Stay with the Commonwealth Court. The application requested that Bell be directed to provide a free per-call blocking mechanism if it chose to offer Caller*ID to the general public or, alternatively, that Bell be permitted to offer Caller* ID service <em>only </em>to emergency service providers, <em>ie., </em>police, fire and county emergency dispatch centers, during the pendency of the appeal.

A majority of the court, in an opinion by Judge Smith, also found that the PUC’s approval of Caller*ID violated the privacy rights of Pennsylvania citizens guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution. The court also ruled that the limited blocking procedure approved by the Commission was wholly devoid of minimum due process protections and that the PUC decision on that point was not supported by substantial evidence. The Commonwealth Court majority also declared that Caller*ID service would be unlawful and unconstitutional even if it were offered along with the per-call blocking option recommended by the ALJ.</p>

Such emergency service providers are exempt from the relevant prohibitions of the Wiretap Act. On July 18,1990, the court entered an order denying the Application for Reargument, but, in doing so, declared that the court’s majority opinion “neither impliedly nor expressly invalidates any provision of the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 P.C.S. §§ 5701-5781, allowing the use of recording and trap-and-trace devices by police and other designated emergency systems.</p>

Bell contends that Caller* ID involves only a single trap and trace by the telephone company. It is Bell’s network computers that “capture” the caller’s number by computer software that identifies and stores the number in memory upon placement of a call. The call recipient merely receives the resulting information which is transmitted by Bell from its network computer. The display unit is entirely passive, like a television or radio or mailbox. It does not send any signal to or otherwise act on or manipulate the telephone network to ferret out the caller’s number from the mass of electronic signals in the network. That function of “capturing” the caller’s number is performed by the telephone company, without whose deciphering of the electronic signals in the network the called party would have no ability to identify the number. Appellees respond to this argument by contending there are <em>two </em>traps which take place when Caller* ID service is used. The first is by the telephone company and it occurs when the calling number is placed in the memory of the called party’s central office. <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>This trap may be exempted from the provisions of Section 5771(b) under certain circumstances. But there is a second trap — when the calling number is deposited and stored in the customer’s Caller*ID device. That trap is not the use of “a trap and trace device by a provider of electronic or wire communication service” and thus is not exempted. Whatever the merits of this argument, and the Commonwealth Court agreed with Appellees and concluded that neither the “Caller* ID device nor the data captured by the device is controlled or maintained by Bell but rather by the customer subscriber, clearly violating the trap and trace device prohibition ...,” 133 Pa.

As noted by the Commonwealth Court majority:</p>
    <blockquote id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[290,1444,1105,463]]]'>Followed to its logical conclusion, Bell would contend and have this court believe that a Caller*ID subscriber is the user of the service and consents to use of a trap and trace device by subscribing to Caller*ID.

    <p id="b637-7" data-blocks='[["BL_637.7",637,[186,1132,1152,782]]]'>We agree. None of the parties relying upon the exception in Section 5771(b) provides a satisfactory explanation of why the “user” as it appears in Section 5771(b)(2) must refer only to the Caller* ID customer, rather than the calling party, or both the called and calling parties. No one disputes that the definition of “user” in the Wiretap Act includes “any person or entity” who uses the telephone network. 18 P.C.S. § 5702. It is also obvious that when a Caller*ID device is employed, two “users” of the telephone network are involved — the called party <em>and </em>the calling party. It is the caller whose number is being trapped and traced and whose privacy is being jeopardized, and whose “consent” would therefore be particularly relevant. Moreover, under the rules of statutory construction, the singular generally includes the plural. 1 P.C.S. § 1902.</p>

The two-party consent rule has long been established in Pennsylvania as a means of protecting privacy rights and principles of statutory construction require that the provisions of the Wiretap Act <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with those concerns.</p>

If the General Assembly had concluded that the consent to a trap and trace by “one of the users” of the service was sufficient, then they could have so stated. But they did not. In short, Caller*ID violates the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act and therefore the Commonwealth Court decision must be affirmed.</p>

Among the other Bell services approved in this proceeding and currently available to customers is a service known as Call*Trace. With this service, a person who receives an abusive or objectionable phone call can dial a three-digit code and thereby have the call traced by the telephone company. The company can then take appropriate action as to that caller. Unlike Caller*ID, Call*Trace does not reveal the caller’s number directly to the called party.</p>
