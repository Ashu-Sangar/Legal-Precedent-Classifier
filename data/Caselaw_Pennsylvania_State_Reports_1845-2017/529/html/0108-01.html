Outside the appellant pulled a gun and shot one Lamont Pollar in the back during a chase around a parked car. Lamont Pollar died. The appellant was brought to trial, pled self defense, which the jury did not accept, and was convicted of first degree murder,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> conspiracy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and possession of an instrument of crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The jury’s verdict, given the evidence that they heard and accepted, is beyond quarrel: by the appellant’s own statement he fired the fatal shot; and the reasons he gave were contradicted by an eyewitness who saw him, in the chase around the car, fire the gun, and saw the 16 year old victim “go down.”</p>

The dispute took place at the Bus Stop Bar on November 9,1985. Eventually it escalated to a point where a series of shots were fired and an eyewitness observed the appellant holding a gun at the time of the shooting. The victim was subsequently found dead one block from the incident; he had a bullet wound in the back. Later that evening the appellant returned to the scene and asked the police what had transpired. They asked his name and he gave a name not his own. Still later, appellant again returned to the scene, this time in different clothing and was seen trying to open the trunk of a car which was ultimately identified as belonging to him. A police officer who staked out the scene interrupted appellant’s activity and placed him under arrest. After a search warrant was obtained, the police found a gun in the appellant’s trunk, later determined to be the fatal weapon.</p>

    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[225,658,1151,523]]]'>In response, the Commonwealth contends that although trial counsel’s strategy involved the disclosure of the appellant’s previous criminal record, this strategy was reasonable and was designed to further appellant’s interests. As to appellant’s second issue, the Commonwealth responds that the trial court’s cautionary instructions to the jury cured any possible prejudice which may have occurred by the witness’ unprovoked outburst, and therefore the trial court was correct in denying appellant’s request for a mistrial.</p>

      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>Appellant’s defense at trial was self defense: he contended that the victim’s death occurred as a result of the scuffle in front of the bar. In order to support his self defense claim, there being no other witnesses that he could call to his aid, his own testimony was obviously necessary, and his case rested upon the jury believing he was credible. In furtherance of this approach, defense counsel, during his opening statement, stated the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[278,724,1108,513]]]'>You will hear from Mr. Savage, the cashier at the Super Fresh at Wynnewood and Lancaster Avenue. We will again elicit from him, and we will elicit from a number of character witnesses, including a Bishop of the church, a reverend, and some of the ladies, that for the past ten years Mr. Savage has had no criminal convictions; his wife is raising three children, et cetera. We will not attempt to hide from you that in the seventies that he had two or three convictions and got probation for certain matters. It will all come out.</blockquote>

    <p id="b217-7" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[235,1375,1151,684]]]'>At trial, appellant testified that after the scuffle he was afraid that the three youths would return; he hid the gun in the trunk in order to prevent the youths from retrieving it; and he did not reveal his identity to the police in fear of damaging his family’s reputation. Trial counsel then called character witnesses who testified as to the appellant’s good reputation in the community. In response, the Commonwealth offered proof of appellant’s previous convictions of attempted burglary, weapons charge and selling drugs, and cross examined appellant’s witnesses about their knowledge of these prior activities. In each case the character witness indicated that these prior indiscretions did not alter their opinion of appellant.</p>

Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first degree murder conviction and a concurrent period of one to two years imprisonment on the weapons conviction. The trial court did not impose sentence on the conspiracy conviction due apparently to a misreading of 18 Pa.C.S. § 906. That section provides:</p>
      <blockquote id="b215-7" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[293,1803,1083,148]]]'>A person may not be convicted of more than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal contempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.</blockquote>
      <p id="b215-8" data-blocks='[["BL_215.7",215,[259,1961,1117,381]]]'>Here, the trial judge interpreted this section to mean that appellant’s conviction of conspiracy merged into his murder conviction; therefore, he did not impose sentence on the underlying conspiracy conviction. Since this aspect of the sentence was not appealed by the Commonwealth, our purpose in addressing this issue is for the purpose of clarification. This was an incorrect reading of the statute. Section 906 provides only that a defendant cannot be sentenced on multiple inchoate crimes related to the same completed crime; it does not mean that the underlying inchoate crime merges into the completed crime.</p>
