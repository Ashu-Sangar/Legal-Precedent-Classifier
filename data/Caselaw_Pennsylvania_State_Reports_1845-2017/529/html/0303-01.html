    <p id="b416-7" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[243,990,1151,1269]]]'>In its analysis of the transfer provision of the Juvenile Act, the Court of Common Pleas determined that no child may be transferred from adult criminal court to juvenile proceedings unless he suffers from some disorder or defect which caused the child to commit the murder. Restated, the court held that a mental defect or disorder must cause the criminal action. That requirement contravenes the legislative intent of the amendments to the Juvenile Act that allow transfer of a murder case from criminal to juvenile proceedings. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6322(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The plain language of the Juvenile Act requires the court to determine that the child is “amenable to treatment, supervision or rehabilitation as a juvenile through available facilities---In determining this, the court shall consider [several] factors____” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6355(a)(4)(iii)(A). The trial court’s interpretation of the Juvenile Act precludes the weighing of any factors to determine amenability once the court establishes that no disease or defect caused the killing. This contradicts Sections 6355 and 6322, most recently amended in 1986, which allow the child to prove amenability and proscribe the standards to be used in making that determination as those in Section 6355(a)(4)(iii)(A). This particular clause contains no reference to a mental disease or defect.</p>

The Chief Justice has written for the majority in a dispassionate way, highlighting the law as expressed by the legislature, and I join in that opinion. Some of our colleagues, however, cry for the recognition of a public policy that children of the age of nine years and under (how about 10 or 11 or 12 years of age, etc.?) must not be treated as murderers and must not be tried as murderers under any circumstances. Perhaps they are right. But that is a matter better left to the Legislature.</p>
    <p id="b420-7" data-blocks='[["BL_420.8",420,[219,1205,1148,582]]]'>It seems to me that the concurring justices are engaging in oxymoronic dialogue in this case because they do not really agree with the majority opinion or its rationale. On the one hand, they say that a nine-year-old killer should not be tried as an adult killer, yet, on the other hand, by joining the majority opinion they accept the fact as proved by the murderer’s own statements and the opinions of the doctors who examined him that he knew exactly what he was doing and they are content to remand to the trial judge to determine in a proper analysis whether this child should be treated as a juvenile or an adult.</p>

But if the propriety of trying a nine year old for murder is in doubt then why waste everyone’s time by a remand which will only raise more questions. What happens if the trial judge properly concludes that this nine year old is not amenable to treatment, <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>supervision and rehabilitation? Do we then try him as an adult for murder of the first degree?

    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[214,1006,1151,516]]]'>I vigorously and emphatically dissent. The trial judge herein was eminently correct in his interpretation and application of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 6301-6365, and made a courageous decision that, no doubt, flies in the face of the view taken of the issue by many citizens of this Commonwealth. Whether or not we <em>personally </em>find it “shocking” to try a nine year old child on a charge of murder in criminal court, this Court does not have the authority to rewrite a statute duly enacted by the Legislature.</p>
    <p id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.8",421,[215,1547,1150,797]],["BL_422.1",422,[242,314,1145,98]]]'>Mr. Justice Flaherty, in his concurring opinion, states that it is not the public policy of this Commonwealth to criminally prosecute nine year old children for murder. This is simply not true. Murder is a heinous crime, and the Legislature is unquestionably cognizant of this fact. <em>All </em>crimes and <em>all </em>criminals were tried in “adult” criminal courts prior to the enactment of legislation early in this century requiring the special treatment of juveniles in our courts. There were no juvenile courts until the Legislature created juvenile courts. When the Legislature did so, it explicitly excluded murder from the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts but gave juveniles charged with murder the opportunity to transfer their cases from criminal court to juvenile court if certain prescribed conditions were met. Children were <em>always </em>subject to the jurisdiction of the criminal courts of this <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>Commonwealth if they committed murder; in this respect, the law has not changed.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[240,444,1150,963]]]'>This nine year old defendant is not an innocent victim of the tragic instances of accidental shootings occurring in homes where firearms are handled carelessly. He had been repeatedly instructed in the safe handling of firearms, he had shot a rifle while at a gun club to which his parents belonged, and he had gone hunting with his father. The as yet uncontested evidence presented at the hearings on his petition for transfer show that the petitioner, Cameron R. Kocher, in an ill temper, took a key from where it was hidden in the base of a lamp, unlocked a gun cabinet, loaded the proper ammunition into a .35 caliber rifle equipped with a scope, unlocked a bedroom window, removed a screen from the window, and aimed the rifle at a seven year old girl, the daughter of two loving parents, as she played, blissfully unaware of the fate about to befall her, with other children in the snow. The rifle, which was in excellent working condition, had a heavy trigger pull and could not accidently discharge under normal circumstances.</p>

The bullet pierced her spine and right lung; she collapsed instantly, like a game animal shot by a skilled and experienced hunter, and died on the operating table a short time thereafter. The petitioner carefully returned the rifle to the gun cabinet and hid the empty shell casing. When he returned to his neighbor’s residence where the victim had been taken after the shooting, he exhibited no emotion on viewing her moribund body and proceeded to play Nintendo as if nothing were amiss. Further, the petitioner, who had received a gash in his forehead when the gun recoiled and the scope struck him, lied about the cause of the gash to his neighbors, his parents and the police. We are not dealing with a guileless boy here and a victimless crime. We do know for certain that an innocent <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>life has been snuffed out with a bullet in the back, delivered by careful aim and followed by a well thought-out cover-up.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[199,423,1150,419]]]'>The trial court meticulously reviewed and discussed the evidence in light of <em>every </em>statutory factor and found that petitioner had proven few factors in favor of granting the transfer request. The petitioner’s lack of previous misconduct and his age at the time of the offense were the only factors viewed in petitioner’s favor. Significantly, age is only <em>one </em>statutory factor that the Legislature permits the courts to consider under section 6322(a) of the Juvenile Act.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[197,874,1152,744]]]'>Only after the trial court had considered all of the statutory factors, did the trial court consider petitioner’s argument that he was suffering from an anxiety disorder that was amenable to treatment as a juvenile. It was solely in response to this assertion that the trial court discussed the meaning and interpretation of the “amenable to treatment” language of section 6355(a)(4)(iii)(A), and concluded that the Legislature could not have intended for defects or disorders arising <em>after </em>the commission of the offense to justify a transfer request. The majority herein errs in reading the trial court’s opinion as setting forth an absolute criterion for transfer that overrides every other statutory factor, and, indeed, the majority is plain wrong when it implies that the trial court ignored the statutory factors.</p>
    <p id="b423-7" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[194,1649,1155,364]]]'>Accordingly, I dissent and would affirm the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County. Questions about the petitioner’s competency to stand trial, capacity to form criminal intent, and possible dispositions in the event of a guilty verdict are all properly matters within the jurisdiction of the <em>criminal </em>court where the Legislature has, in its wisdom, bestowed jurisdiction.</p>
