Ms. Gantt knew the appellant, and after they talked for about five minutes, the appellant left. That meeting was to put appellant near the scene and subsequently in the eye of the police. The events that <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>followed began in the normal form. A second nursing assistant, Karen Carroll, tending another patient at the Riverview Apartments, located near the center, forgot a book in her car. At approximately 5:20 P.M. she went down to get the book and exited through a rear door. As she did she observed a black male a dozen feet from the door. While she went to her car the individual gained entry to the apartment building. After retrieving her book Ms. Carroll returned to her patient. At approximately 7:00 P.M., when her shift ended, Ms. Carroll started to leave by the third floor fire exit. As she opened the door to the stairway she stepped into a large pool of blood. Thinking a patient hemorrhaged she followed the blood trail first to the floors below and then to the fourth floor landing where she found the battered and lifeless body of Tillie Katz. The police were called.</p>

Pittsburgh Police Homicide Detective Tony Condemi arrived at the scene. He followed the blood trail from the second floor elevator foyer to the fourth floor where Tillie Katz lay dead. The trail yielded her broken glasses, pocket book, shopping bag and a small tote bag with identifying Medicare and credit cards. Of more significance, on the third floor, he found foot prints in the blood, a piece of jade jewelry and a round gold earring. The blood on the shoe prints would later be found to match the blood on appellant’s shoes, and a fragment of a jewel stone, also found in the blood, would “fracture match” a bracelet found in appellant’s girlfriend’s apartment. When the police went to question the appellant at that apartment, he denied involvement and agreed to accompany them to the police station. Pursuant to written consent of his girlfriend, her apartment was searched and further evidence obtained: evidence which became part of an avalanche of guilt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Subsequently, appellant confessed in detail. He told the police that after he gained entrance through the <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>door left open by Ms. Carroll, he saw Tillie Katz, spoke to her, and when she answered, struck her with a steel pipe he had brought concealed in his waistband. The pipe had been brought to further his quest which he described as “[l]ooking to rob someone.” Appellant also told the police how he dragged Ms. Katz down the hallway to the stairwell where he then raped her and robbed her of $12.00 and her jewelry. Given this evidence, the jury had every reason to take him at his admitted word and there is no reason to doubt that they were right. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented a panoply of experts attesting to the victim’s cause of death as well as the sexual assault.</p>
