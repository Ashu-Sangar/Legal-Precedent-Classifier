Hainsey (licensees), the appellants herein, for possessing and operating gambling devices and for permitting gambling or lotteries on the premises of their tavern, the Double S. Bar in Altoona, Pennsylvania. On October 16, 1986, a hearing examiner conducted a hearing on these charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Board offered the testimony of two witnesses, these being a Pennsylvania State Police Trooper and a Board Enforcement Officer. These witnesses had played only a supervisory role in investigating operations at the Double S. Bar, and were unable to provide testimony sufficient to prove the Board’s case, inasmuch as they lacked adequate firsthand knowledge of the facts.</p>

Criminal proceedings had been commenced in May, 1986, when the licensees were charged with violations of the gambling laws. Realizing that these criminal charges would not be disposed of before the present hearing, counsel for the licensees had, prior to the date of the hearing, requested that the proceeding be postponed in order to save his clients the expense and inconvenience of <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>appearing at a time when the Board would be unable to proceed with its case.
