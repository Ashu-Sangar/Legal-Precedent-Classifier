As a result of the accident Mr. Fishinger underwent amputation of part of one leg, and remained hospitalized for one month. On June 8, 1987, two days after the accident, the appellee, attorney Lloyd arrived at the hospital to discuss a contingent fee agreement with Mr. Fishinger, whereby Mr. Lloyd would provide legal representation for Mr. Fishinger as a result of any claim arising from the accident.

    <blockquote id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[278,1117,1108,309]]]'>Violation of a Rule should not give rise to a cause of action nor should it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached.

The statute, on the other hand, clearly establishes that such a contract is against public policy and is therefore void.
