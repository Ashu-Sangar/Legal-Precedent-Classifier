Eight members of the eleven-person Board were in attendance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The subject of the meeting was to consider whether Mr. Hagan would be <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>authorized to cite physician Samuel S.

    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[242,527,1149,464]]]'>Mr. Hagan represented to the Board that he had investigated a patient complaint which raised the following allegation. On November 26, 1984, Dr. Lyness had performed a partial craniotomy on a 17-year-old female patient (“A.Z.”). Two days later, on November 28, 1984, the patient filed a report with local police alleging that on the prior evening, while in intensive care recovering from brain surgery, Dr. Lyness had fondled her vagina and placed his penis in her mouth.</p>

The Complaint was issued under the signature of Barbara K. Shore, Ph.D., Chairperson of the Board.</p>

On March 22, 1988, the Board convened a meeting and voted to affirm the factual findings of the Hearing Examiner.

      <em>Pollock </em>and similar cases stand only for the sensible proposition that in the modern world of sprawling governmental entities akin to corporations it would be both unrealistic and counterproductive to insist that administrative agencies be forbidden from handling both prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions, where such roles are parcelled out and divided among distinct departments or boards.
