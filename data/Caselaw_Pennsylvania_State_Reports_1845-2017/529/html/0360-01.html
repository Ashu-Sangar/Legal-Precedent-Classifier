Although the course of the litigation remains the responsibility of the parties, the Rule authorizes the establishment of an administrative mechanism for bringing <em>apparently </em>inactive matters before the court for proposed termination on the court’s own motion. As stated in the note accompanying the Rule, “[w]here a party objects to the termination of an inactive matter, it is intended that the court exercise its <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>judicial discretion.” It was not intended that Rule 1901, or the local rules adopted pursuant to it, would alter the standards for the proper exercise of the court’s discretion when a party objects to a proposed termination.</p>

It would seem something of an anomaly to apply the same standard at a hearing to decide whether to terminate a case as would be applied in assessing a petition to open judgment where no hearing was held prior to termination.
