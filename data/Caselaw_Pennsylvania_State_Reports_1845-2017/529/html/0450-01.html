According to the testimony at trial, the child victim became withdrawn, started having nightmares and wanted to accompany his mother any time she left the home. When interviewed by a child protective service worker, the child appeared nervous and distraught. The child’s babysitter testified that in June, 1986, the child told her that he had been abused by his father, was frightened and did not want to be in his father’s presence.</p>

We affirm that decision on the basis of our opinion in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Dunkle, </em>we also held that it was error to permit an expert to testify as to why children who have suffered sexual abuse may delay reporting the incident. Thus, for the reasons set forth in <em>Dunkle, </em>we affirm the decision of the Superior Court remanding the case for a new trial.</p>

Appellant also claims that Appellee waived the issue of whether the Appellant’s expert should have been entitled to testify about the sexually abused child syndrome. Immediately after the testimony of the Appellant’s expert, defense counsel moved that the testimony be stricken, since "[you] can’t come in with very general information in every case and lay it out in front of the Jury with nothing else and that’s what happened here.” (N.T. 288). During the colloquy with the Court, the trial judge stated "[yjour objection is on the record and if you’re right, it’s something you’re protected on the record, I note again like some of the other issues this is a cutting edge issue----” <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>The trial judge also noted that there was some confusion as to the state of the law in this area, referring to <em>Commonwealth v.

      <p id="b556-9" data-blocks='[["BL_556.2",556,[260,1932,1117,389]]]'>It is admittedly difficult to discern precisely the nature of the objection raised by defense counsel. In his post trial opinion, the trial judge notes that "[t]here does appear to be inconsistency in the Defendant’s argument post-verdict with his request during the trial." Nevertheless, the trial court and the Superior Court (in its memorandum opinion) both addressed the issue. In light of their respective decisions to address the substance of the issue and to foreclose any possibility of an ineffectiveness claim in a Post-Conviction Relief Act petition (which would most certainly follow, were we to find the issue waived), we too will address the merits of the case.</p>
