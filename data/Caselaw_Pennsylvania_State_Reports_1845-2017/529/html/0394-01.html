On March 1, 1982, appellee, then twenty-nine (29) years old, and her then fiance, now husband, Richard Via, visited their family doctor, Leroy Sykes, M.D. The couple was concerned that appellee had not become pregnant even though they had not used any consistent form of birth control during the previous five (5) year period. Dr. Sykes tested Mr. Via and determined that his sperm were viable. Accordingly, the doctor concluded that if there was a fertility <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>problem, it was with appellee. He then recommended that appellee see appellant, Dr. Raeuchle, who was a surgeon specializing in procedures involving a laparoscope.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[227,451,1151,524]]]'>On March 8, 1982, appellee visited appellant’s office, at which time he performed a pelvic examination, which showed no abnormalities. Appellant then advised appellee of three possible procedures for determining whether she could conceive,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> each of which was designed to determine if the fallopian tubes were open and receptive to egg and sperm migration. Appellant advised appellee that a laparoscopic procedure (a/k/a laparoscopy) was the most accurate of the three procedures and generally a short and relatively pain-free operation.</p>

In appellee’s case, in conjunction with the laparoscopy, appellant recommended the performance of a tubal patency test. Said test is designed to measure the ability of the fallopian tubes to accept eggs from the ovaries:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> basically it is a test to see if the tubes are open. This test involves the injection of dye into the tubes and then a monitoring of the progression of the dye through the tubes. In a perfect fallopian tube the dye would proceed up through the tube and empty out of the end which is closest to the ovary. However, in an imperfect tube the flow of dye would be blocked and the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>observer would then be able to determine the location of the blockage.</p>

Appellant testified extensively about what occurred during the procedure. According to his testimony the laparoscope revealed that both fallopian tubes were severely damaged and “immediately [he] knew, number one, that she was probably sterile and could not get pregnant.” His subsequent actions were, in part, premised on the initial diagnosis of probable infertility. Appellant noted that both fallopian tubes were “involved [with] hydrosalpinx,” which is a collection of watery fluid in the tube “[t]hat is the end stage after longstanding disease of chronic inflammatory disease that is accompanied by pus in the tube.” Appellant concluded that the left tube was “shot” beyond repair but that the right tube, although damaged, was possibly salvageable. Appellant then proceeded to cut off the tip of the tube “in order to provide a wide open lumen [the inner open space of a tubular organ].” Appellant also testified that his reason for cutting off this <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>tip was to “treat [the] disease” he found by allowing “internal drainage” which would then “prevent the reoccurrence hopefully ... a (sic) bacteria getting into this culture medium.” After cutting the tip, a watery substance and the dye immediately drained from the tube, indicating that the tube was now completely open. This would also (theoretically) allow an unfertilized egg to enter the tube.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[226,703,1149,364]]]'>As standard operating procedure, appellant then attempted to retrieve the excised tip of the tube for testing. In the process of retrieval, he inadvertently punctured an ovarian artery, causing immediate and profuse bleeding. In response to the bleeding, appellant made a full incision into the abdomen, and with the help of another surgeon stopped the bleeding and repaired the artery.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[223,1085,1151,1118]],["BL_505.1",505,[217,291,1151,254]]]'>At that point appellant, knowing that the opening he had created at the tip of the fallopian tube would close through natural processes -within a three to eight day period, decided that the best course of action would be to do a salpingostomy on the right tube. A salpingostomy is a procedure which involves the use of a few small sutures to tie the end of the tube back<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> to prevent it from closing in the natural course. Such a procedure generally keeps the tube open for a three to six month period and, in some cases, for as long as a year. Appellant’s decision to do the salpingostomy was related to the unexpected opening of the abdomen (necessitated by the bleeding artery): a salpingostomy is difficult to do during a laparoscopic procedure but relatively simple once there is a complete incision into the abdomen. An alternative course would have been to close appellee up after the bleeding was controlled and to recommend to her additional surgery to keep the fallopian tubes open. After the operation, appellant advised appellee of what had transpired, including the creation, by the salpingostomy, of a three (3) to six (6) month “window” during which it was possible for her to get pregnant (so long as the right tube <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>did not reclose naturally). Appellee testified that she was resistent to the idea of attempting to become pregnant during the “window” period because she was not yet married; she married on September 11, 1982, five and one half (5V2) months after the operation.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[215,567,1151,461]]]'>Subsequently, appellee filed the instant action against appellant and Community General Osteopathic Hospital alleging various wrongdoings.

On appeal, a three judge panel of the Superior Court (McEwen, Olszewski and Popovich, J.J.) reversed the trial court, with a dissent by Judge McEwen. The Superior Court held:</p>

Appellee’s rationale is that the tuboplasty constituted a separate and distinct surgical procedure which was unnecessary and which carried with it material risks and consequences which differed from the laparoscopy and tubal patency test, and that these risks and consequences were never conveyed to her.</p>
