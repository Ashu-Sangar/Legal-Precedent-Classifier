These charges stemmed from the killing of sixteen-year-old Steven Warunek, found shot to death on November 14, 1974, in Reading, Berks County. Cohen was tried by jury in Berks County.</p>

At the time he was killed, Warunek was engaged to Kerry Young, Cohen’s former girlfriend who had a child fathered by Cohen. Apparently Miss Young did not see Cohen after she bore his child in November 1973. Nevertheless, Miss Young told Warunek that she had an emotional attachment to Cohen as the father of her child and that she was upset with Cohen for “abandoning” the child. In October 1974, Warunek told his fiancée that he was going to kill Cohen. Miss Young called Cohen to warn him of Warunek’s threat.</p>

On appeal, this court vacated the judgments of sentence due to pervasive prejudicial pretrial publicity with “unprecedented” percentages of prospective jurors possessing opinions of appellant’s guilt, and ordered retrial in a different venue, Lackawanna County. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Cohen, <a href="/pa/489/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="489 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1762407" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0167-01">489 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="489 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1762407" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0167-01">413 A.2d 1066</a> (1980).</p>

On the day scheduled for trial, Cohen presented an oral motion in limine to prohibit the introduction of testimony concerning the existence of the child of Cohen and Miss Young on the ground that the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial. Cohen also sought to bar evidence of intent to kill on the basis of collateral estoppel, arguing that his acquittal of first degree murder and conviction of third degree murder must have been based on a jury finding that he lacked the specific intent to kill which distinguishes first degree from third degree murder. The trial court granted both motions. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, certifying that the trial court’s orders had the effect of terminating or substantially handicapping the prosecution. The Superior Court reversed the trial court. Cohen sought and was allowed an appeal to this court.</p>

The fundamental consideration, a matter of jurisdiction, is the finality of the order. The appellate jurisdiction invoked by the Commonwealth is limited to final orders. 42 Pa.C.S. § 742. As to finality, pretrial suppression orders and orders granting motions in limine for the exclusion of evidence are identical. Our holdings in <em>Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, </em><a href="/pa/411/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="411 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1885971" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0056-01">411 Pa. 56</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A.2d 304</a> (1963), and <em>Dugger, supra, </em>were grounded on our recognition that a pretrial suppression order is, in its practical effect, a final order, thus satisfying the statutory predicate of 42 Pa.C.S. § 742. The grant of a motion in limine which deprives the prosecution of important evidence is identical in effect, characterized by identical indicia of finality. Moreover, like our holdings in <em>Bosurgi </em>and <em>Dugger, supra, </em>which permitted Commonwealth appeals from suppression orders entered after pretrial suppression hearings, our holding today extends only to motions presented prior to trial, that is, before the swearing of the jury. To permit an appeal from a pretrial order granting a motion to exclude evidence will not have the effect of interrupting and disrupting a jury trial. Once a jury is sworn, however, jeopardy attaches, <em>Commonwealth v. Klobuchir, </em><a href="/pa/486/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="486 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1757593" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0241-01">486 Pa. 241</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="486 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1757593" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0241-01">405 A.2d 881</a> (1979), and the Commonwealth will not be permitted to appeal an adverse evidentiary ruling during the trial.</p>

First, they argue that a suppression order is of constitutional dimension, unlike an order granting a motion in limine. Next, they claim that a suppression order serves a different purpose from the grant of a motion in limine. Finally, they argue that permitting Commonwealth appeals from adverse rulings on pretrial motions in limine will have the undesirable effect of inhibiting defense counsel from seeking pretrial determinations of evidentiary questions and will in<a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>stead encourage defense counsel to wait until midtrial to challenge Commonwealth evidence.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[244,424,1150,571]]]'>We do not find these arguments persuasive. The first is simply incorrect. Although it is true that suppression orders are necessary to vindicate Fourth Amendment rights, it might just as well be necessary to grant a motion in limine in order to protect other constitutional rights, as this case illustrates. The trial court’s order prohibiting the admission of evidence of intent to kill was grounded on the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. It is therefore inaccurate to ascribe greater constitutional weight to suppression orders than to orders such as those at issue in this case.</p>
    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[240,1033,1151,687]]]'>The second claim is correct but irrelevant. The purpose of the exclusionary rule was made quite clear by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/367/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="367 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="1785580" data-case-paths="/us/367/0643-01">367 U.S. 643</a>, <a href="/us/367/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="367 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="1785580" data-case-paths="/us/367/0643-01">81 S.Ct. 1684</a>, <a href="/us/367/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="367 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="1785580" data-case-paths="/us/367/0643-01">6 L.Ed.2d 1081</a> (1961). It was to sanction unconstitutional police procedures in a way designed to discourage such behavior and to protect citizens from such illegal conduct. But to point out that the purpose to be served by excluding evidence on a motion in limine is <em>different </em>from the purpose of a suppression order in no way undermines the validity or desirability of the former. If a motion in limine seeks to protect an important or fundamental right, it is irrelevant that it is a different right from the one implicated by the <em>Mapp </em>exclusionary rule.</p>

Appellant predicts that trial strategy in criminal cases will be guided in an undesirable direction if Commonwealth appeals are permitted in this context. We are not inclined to accept this argument. It is not clear that defense attorneys in criminal practice will invariably decline to present a motion in limine merely because a favorable ruling may be appealed by the Commonwealth. We are confident that the facts and circumstances of each case will guide the strategy of defense counsel.</p>

Although the term “illegitimate” is not in favor, the concept remains. Historically, to be born out of wedlock was to be illegitimate, and a stigma was cast upon the child. Until relatively recently, Pennsylvania law contained certain disabilities associated with bastardy or illegitimacy. Although the law has developed to remove the stigma unfairly cast upon the child, a residue of ill-feeling may remain, particularly with regard to unmarried parents. Cohen’s behavior will elicit different levels of opprobrium from individual to individual, from juror to juror, and from community to community. Discretion is granted to trial courts partly because they are in a uniquely close relationship with the communities from which their juries are drawn, and an evaluation of the prejudicial impact of disclosing that Cohen fathered a child out of wedlock is a task particularly suitable for the trial court. While we may not agree with the evaluation of the trial court, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighed its probative value.

Indeed, this Court has deemed such orders “final” for purposes of appeal because of the practical effects that an order suppressing relevant evidence has on the prosecution. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, </em><a href="/pa/411/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="411 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1885971" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0056-01">411 Pa. 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A.2d 304</a> (1963).</p>

A motion <em>in limine </em>requires a preliminary ruling which is subject to change during the course of trial should the balance tip in favor of admission. <em>See, </em>22A C.J.S.

As noted above, some evidence is simply irrelevant. And, while some evidence which is the subject of a motion <em>in limine </em>may, indeed, substantially handicap the prosecution, the rules permit an appeal upon certification of the trial court. <em>See, </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b); Pa.R.App.P. 312, 1311-1312. To permit the Commonwealth the right to appeal all orders granting a motion <em>in limine </em>will inundate the appellate courts with evidentiary rulings, the subject of which should be left to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>

Based upon the majority opinion, no sane defense counsel would file a motion <em>in limine </em>because if successful, the Commonwealth will be able to directly appeal that judicial determination claiming that the prosecution was substantially harmed, thereby self-authenticating that harm without risk of future penalty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> The Commonwealth, then, will be the only party filing motions <em>in limine. </em>If the Commonwealth is unsuccessful in asserting its position and the court denies the motion, the majority opinion now provides the prosecution an absolute <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>right of automatic appeal from that determination. Thus, the majority opinion creates a situation where, through no fault of the defense, a defendant may be required either to remain in jail or at bail, effectively waiving his speedy trial rights. This is unacceptable.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[199,546,1152,1174]]]'>The majority opinion fails to take into account the right of a defendant to a speedy trial, instead focusing only on the right of the prosecution to present all its evidence. Rather than look only to the fact that the Commonwealth may be precluded from presenting all its available evidence, we should employ a balancing test in which a court, as opposed to the prosecution making an unilateral decision, will weigh the severity of the harm to the prosecution against the right of the defendant to have a speedy trial. The procedure currently in effect whereby the trial court may certify for appeal an order involving a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion where an immediate appeal of that order may materially advance the ultimate determination of the matter, addresses both concerns. 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b). To allow the Commonwealth the absolute right to appeal an order granting or denying a motion <em>in limine </em>will provide the prosecution a license to delay the case to the prejudice of the defendant even where the evidence excluded may not be relevant to the prosecution. This balancing test is simply not necessary when dealing with a motion to suppress because only the defense will file such motions, whereas both the Commonwealth and the defense file motions <em>in limine.</em>

I also agree in principle with those comments of Mr. Justice Zappala and Mr. <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>Justice Cappy that the effects of the majority’s decision will likely alter the manner in which motions-in-limine practice will proceed. Thus, in anticipation of that fact I offer the following suggestions. First, if a motion-in-limine is filed, the trial judge <em>must </em>enter a ruling on it prior to trial; if a judge refuses to so rule, a mandamus action will lie. Second, once ruled upon, the ruling is not reversible during the course of the trial; and if the trial court attempts to reverse a motion-in-limine ruling favorable to the Commonwealth during the course of the trial, the Commonwealth should be entitled to an immediate stay and subsequent expedited appellate review of that determination. This latter procedure is necessary to insure that the Commonwealth will not be adversely affected in its trial preparation by an unfulfilled reliance upon the finality of the motion-in-limine ruling. The same urgency is not attendant to a changed ruling <em>vis a vis </em>the defendant since the system already provides him protection via the avenue of post trial motions.</p>
