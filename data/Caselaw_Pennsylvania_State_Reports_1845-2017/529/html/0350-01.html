(PPI) filed an action against Insurance Company of North America (INA) alleging that INA defaulted on its promise to issue payment on performance bonds to parties who had contracted for PPI’s services. An amended complaint was filed in 1981 and no other action of record was taken in the case until INA filed a motion to dismiss in 1987. The issue presented in this case is whether Superior Court erred in reversing the trial court’s entry of judgment non pros against PPI on the grounds that INA <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>had made no showing of prejudice caused by the six year delay.

Twelve to fourteen years after the events in question, at the point of the appeal to Superior Court, no discovery had been taken.</p>

On the other hand, where a plaintiff, without reasonable explanation, has delayed an inordinate time to pursue his action, a defendant may have difficulty defending because of the lapse of time, and we must make note of our cognizance of how anxiety based on apprehension of being sued can affect a defendant.

The majority has chosen to ignore the well-established rule in this Commonwealth that the grant of <em>non pros </em>is founded upon the equitable principle of laches not the statute of limitations. <em>James Brothers Lumber Company v. Union Banking and Trust Company of DuBois, </em><a href="/pa/432/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="432 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1919663" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0129-01">432 Pa. 129</a>, 132-133, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="247 A.2d 587">247 A.2d 587</a>, 590 (1968). The question of laches does not depend, as does the statute of limitation, upon the fact that a certain time has elapsed since the cause of actions accrued, but whether under all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the plaintiff is chargeable with want of due diligence in failing to proceed with reasonable promptitude. <em>Manson v. First National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/366/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="366 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="8845338" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0211-01">366 Pa. 211</a>, 215, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="77 A.2d 399">77 A.2d 399</a>, 401 (1951). Nor will the plaintiff be penalized for laches if his delay has not resulted in injury to his adversary. <em><a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="77 A.2d 399">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/366/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="366 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="8845338" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0211-01">366 Pa. at 216</a>, <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a><a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="77 A.2d 399">77 A.2d at </a>402 citing <em>Montgomery Brothers, Inc. v.

In <em>Shrum </em>we stated: “Such a lapse of time [in bringing a post-trial motion on for argument] is presumptively prejudicial to all parties even without any specific showing of prejudice on the record____ In these circumstances, and in the discretion of the lower court, a judgment of non pros <em>might </em>well have been entered.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20502" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="269 A.2d 502">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/440/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="440 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1932165" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0383-01">440 Pa. at 386-387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20502" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="269 A.2d 502">269 A.2d at 504</a> (emphasis added). However, the latter statement is merely dictum, because we concluded by stating: “No such motions [non pros] were filed, however, and the lower court did not decide the case on the ground of delay alone. We have therefore considered the appeal on its merits.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20502" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="269 A.2d 502">Id.</a> </em>Reliance on <em>Shrum </em>is therefore misplaced.</p>
