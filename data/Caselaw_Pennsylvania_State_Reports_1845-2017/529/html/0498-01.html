On May 4, 1987, Edna Nitterauer was working at a Philadelphia bookstore when a man entered the store. The store owner asked if the man needed assistance, but the man told him he only wanted to browse. Five minutes later, Nitterauer approached the man and asked him if he required assistance. They engaged in a casual conversation about hobbies, and the man said that his hobby was making <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>picture frames out of cigarette boxes. The man then asked if the store carried any books concerning heart ailments. Nitterauer showed the man one book, but after leafing through it, he asked for another book. As Nitterauer reached for another book, the man stabbed her eight times in the arm and back. Nitterauer tried to pull away and call for help as the man slammed her into a door and on the floor. The man eventually fled, and Nitterauer succeeded in calling for emergency help.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[202,789,1149,308]]]'>John Roman, who owned the gas station next door, watched as the rescue squad arrived. As he observed the activity, Roman saw a man fitting the assailant’s description walk out of an alley between the two buildings and cross the street. Both Nitterauer and Roman gave their descriptions of the man to the police.</p>
    <p id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[201,1115,1150,359]]]'>Based on these descriptions, the police produced a photo array, which did not include a photo of appellant. Nitterauer and Roman viewed the array separately and neither one identified the assailant. On May 12, 1987, a second photo array, which included appellant’s photo, was presented separately to Nitterauer and Roman. This time, both of them identified appellant.</p>

Alternatively, the jury may have been unconvinced of appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but would have settled on a guilty verdict if petitioner were sentenced to a mental hospital instead of a prison.
