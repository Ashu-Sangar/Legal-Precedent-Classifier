In <em>PAAR </em>the defendant sought access to statements made by the victim which were contained in a written report kept on file by <em>PAAR. </em>The defendant’s purpose in requesting these reports was to ascertain the existence of any prior inconsistent statements made by the victim which would support defense counsel’s theory that the victim had consented. The <em>PAAR </em>Court, noting that no statute existed to support PAAR’s assertion of absolute privilege regarding counselor-victim communications, declined to create such a privilege. Instead the court created a limited privilege by which defense counsel would be permitted to inspect “notes that are verbatim accounts of the complainant’s declarations and notes that the complainant has approved as accurately reflecting what she said.” <em><a href="/pa/494/0015-02" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="428 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="1769108" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0015-02">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/494/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="494 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1769086,1769108" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0015-01,/pa/494/0015-02">494 Pa. at 28</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0015-02" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="428 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="1769108" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0015-02">428 A.2d at 132</a>. However, any information solely relating to the counseling service provided and having no bearing whatsoever on the facts of the alleged offense would be withheld from inspection.

These counselors provide victims with much needed physical, psychological and social support during the recovery period that the victims otherwise might not be able to afford. At the onset of counseling the victim is informed that her communications will be confidential, and her willingness to disclose information quite obviously is based upon that expectation. The very nature of the relationship between a counselor and the victim of such a crime exposes the necessity for the same confidentiality that would exist if private psychotherapeutic treatment were obtained. If that confidentiality is removed, that trust is severely undermined, and the maximum therapeutic benefit is lost. The inability of the crisis center to achieve its goals is detrimental not only to the victim but also to society, whose interest in the report and prosecution of sexual assault crimes is furthered by the emotional and physical well-being of the victim.</p>
