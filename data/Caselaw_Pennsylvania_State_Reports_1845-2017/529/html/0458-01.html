The Superior Court reversed in a two-to-one memorandum opinion: “there was no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of the occupants of appellant’s vehicle. The officer could not provide any specific facts for stopping the vehicle other than the allegation he thought it was speeding. In other words, there was not even a minor traffic violation upon <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>which to bottom the stop.” (Slip opinion, p. 5).

The conduct of the Ford, of course, was not uncommon, and there is no reason to frustrate police pursuits aimed at determining whether the vehicle would speed up again. Because the Ford was driven in an unusual manner, it became susceptible to surveillance. <em>Commonwealth v. Murray, </em><a href="/pa/460/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="460 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="482817" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0053-01">460 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="460 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="482817" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0053-01">331 A.2d 414</a> (1975). I also find no relevance in the absence of a formal measurement of the Ford’s speed or in the failure to cite the defendant with a traffic ticket. After all, driving under the influence and with a suspended license are themselves violations of the Motor Vehicle Code. An officer who stops a vehicle legally has the right to consider issuing whatever citation is deemed appropriate under the circumstances.
