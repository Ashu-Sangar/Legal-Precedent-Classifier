While climbing the tower, Carter grabbed onto an uninsulated high voltage wire, and received a charge of electricity. His injuries resulted in amputation of his left forearm and one of his toes. An action was brought against USX pursuant to Section 339 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, “Artificial Conditions Highly Dangerous to Trespassing Children.” The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellants in the amount of $1,500,000, later molded to $1,200,000 to reflect the jury’s apportionment of twenty percent of the negligence to Carter. The trial court subsequently granted USX a new trial after concluding that a television broadcast, viewed by certain jurors and discussed by the jury during deliberations, was prejudicial. On appeal, a Superior Court panel reversed the grant of a new trial. The case was subsequently reargued before Superior Court sitting en banc. A divided court affirmed the order granting a new trial. <a href="/pa-super/390/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="390 Pa.

    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[201,576,1153,1229]]]'>The subject of post-verdict testimony by jurors has been extensively discussed in other opinions of this Court and does not require prolonged discussion here. Briefly stated, the need to ensure fair trials, free from improper influences must be balanced with the need for finality and for protecting the sanctity of the jury room. The rule in Pennsylvania, as well as in a majority of jurisdictions, is that a juror is incompetent to testify as to what occurred during deliberations. <em>Pittsburgh National Bank v. Mutual Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">493 Pa. 96</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">425 A.2d 383</a> (1981). This rule is often referred to as the “no impeachment” rule. However, in order to accommodate the competing policies in this area, a narrow exception has been recognized. The exception permits “post trial testimony of extraneous influences which might have affected [prejudiced] the jury during deliberations.” (Id. at <a href="/citations/?q=493%20Pa.%20101" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="493 Pa. 101">493 Pa. 101</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">425 A.2d 383</a>). Under this exception, the juror may testify only as to the existence of the outside influence, but not as to the effect this outside influence may have had on deliberations. <em>Pittsburgh National Bank, citing Commonwealth v. Zlatovich, </em><a href="/pa/440/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="440 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1932212" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0388-01">440 Pa. 388</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="269 A.2d 469">269 A.2d 469</a> (1970).

The transcript of the post-verdict polling of the jury contains precisely the type of inquiries which the law clearly prohibits. For example, the trial court stated to one juror, “You should say anything that comes to your mind.” (N.T., 2/13/87 at 31). The same juror was asked by the trial court, “So, then, that did have some effect on your deliberation and your <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>verdict?” <em><a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="269 A.2d 469">Id.</a> </em>Another juror was asked by the trial court, “What persuaded you to change your mind?” <em>(Id., </em>at 35).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[217,971,1154,1218]]]'>In <em>Friedman, </em>it was alleged that the jury foreman made an unauthorized visit to the accident scene, took measurements and told his fellow jurors about his findings. Upon inquiry by the trial judge, some of these allegations were denied by the foreman, and inconsistent statements were made by the other jurors as to their recollection of what the foreman related. This Court, invoking the no-impeachment rule, held that post-verdict testimony of what transpired in the jury room was inadmissible. We then stated, “Only in clear cases of <em>improper conduct by jurors, </em>evidenced by competent testimony, should a verdict which is fully supported by the evidence be set aside and a new trial granted.” (emphasis added). <em><a href="/pa/478/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="478 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1740545" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0440-01">Id.,</a> </em>at <a href="/citations/?q=314%20Pa.%20249" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="314 Pa. 249">314 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20900" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="171 A. 900">171 A. 900</a>. Significant to the holding in <em>Friedman </em>was our finding that the information complained of could not have prejudiced the jury because the information communicated by the foreman to the other jurors was information already in evidence. Similarly, in <em>Pittsburgh National Bank, <a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">supra,</a> </em>a juror visited a car dealership and inspected a vehicle similar to the one involved in the case.

    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[219,2208,1149,150]],["BL_522.1",522,[246,303,1155,1810]]]'>In <em>Zlatovich, supra, </em>a discharged juror was quoted in a newspaper article as saying that the jury was afraid to return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity for fear <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>that the defendant might be released after a year or so. This Court held post-verdict testimony as to the juror’s statement inadmissible since such testimony clearly concerned the mental processes by which the jury arrived at the verdict. In the course of resolving the issue of admissibility of post-verdict testimony, we referred in <em>Zlatovich, </em>to an earlier case involving the same issue, <em>Welshire v. Bruaw, </em><a href="/pa/331/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="331 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1184267" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0392-01">331 Pa. 392</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%2067" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="200 A. 67">200 A. 67</a> (1938). In <em>Welshire, </em>we affirmed the trial court’s decision to admit post-verdict testimony of the coercive conduct of the tipstaff in charge of the jury during its deliberations. Our decision in <em>Zlatovich, </em>in further distinguishing the admissible testimony in <em>Welshire, </em>points out that <em>Welshire </em>involved the improper conduct of a <em>third party </em>(emphasis in the original). <em>Zlatovich </em>did not hold, however, that only improper conduct of third parties is a proper basis for admitting post-verdict testimony. In fact, testimony of allegedly prejudicial <em>juror misconduct </em>was found to be admissible in <em>Sero, supra. </em>There, post-verdict testimony consisted of a statement by one juror that another juror’s husband had communicated information concerning the defendant’s interest in Bible study after being charged with wife’s murder. This Court held that testimony of the alleged juror misconduct was admissible but again appeared to tie the admissibility of such misconduct to the concept of third party misconduct when we stated, “information, if prejudicial, that reaches a juror through a third party is precisely the evil our exception to the no impeachment rule is intended to obviate.” Id., <a href="/pa/478/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="478 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1740545" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0440-01">478 Pa. at 448</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="478 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1740545" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0440-01">387 A.2d 63</a>. Although testimony of the alleged juror misconduct was admissible, the conduct was not sufficient to warrant the grant of a new trial since the information did not “create the potential for prejudice that we have said can emasculate a jury’s impartiality and indifference, thus mandating a new trial.” <em><a href="/pa/478/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="478 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1740545" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0440-01">Id.</a></em>

Rather, what emerges is the need to analyze the facts and circumstances of each case with the goal of protecting the sanctity of the jury’s verdict and at the same time preventing injustice. This principle is succinctly stated in <em>Sero, supra: </em>“We can maintain the viability of the jury as a judicial decisionmaking body only by guaranteeing that a verdict is reached by evidence and argument in open court, not by outside influences that might strip the jury of the impartiality we demand.” Although <em>Sero </em>is a criminal case, we believe the commitment to fairness should be the same in criminal and civil trials. “It is fundamental that every litigant who is entitled to a jury trial is entitled to an impartial jury, free to the furthest extent practicable from extraneous influences that may subvert the factfinding process.” <em>Haley v.

Because a trial judge is precluded from considering evidence concerning the subjective impact of an extraneous influence on any juror, it has been widely recognized that the test for determining the prejudicial effect of an extraneous influence is an objective one.

When the trial judge refused to conduct an immediate polling of the jury, deciding instead to “let the matter roll,” counsel for USX, seemingly acquiescing, made no objection nor did he request any alternative such as having the trial judge issue cautionary instructions to the jury.

The trial judge responded, “You can file supplemental ones as you find out.” (N.T. 2/13/87 at 14). Ten days after the verdict, USX filed such a motion. There is no indication in the record that the motion was ever granted or denied.</p>

I see no need to further delineate the holding of <em>Bradley, </em>as the majority does by way of its three-part rule, for prejudice will be apparent on the facts of each case. And in any event, the majority’s third requirement, emotional or inflammatory material, is irrelevant to this analysis. If extraneous material going to a central issue in the case is put before a jury, and that material is not otherwise available, the material need not be inflammatory in order for it to be prejudicial. A jury’s deliberations are to be based on evidence produced in court, not on information received from extraneous sources.</p>

His parents claim USX was negligent because it did not warn of electrical dangers. They say the company should have posted danger signs after another boy lost a hand and part of his foot in a similar 1984 electrocution there. A lawsuit on that incident is being heard now in Allegheny County Court.</blockquote>
