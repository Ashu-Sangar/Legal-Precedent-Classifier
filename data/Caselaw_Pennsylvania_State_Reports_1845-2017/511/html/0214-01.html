On November 21, 1981, according to the testimony of Crater, the three also committed a robbery of Ritchie’s Bar, also in Middletown. According to Crater, the robbery of the bar commenced when Nolen and Evans waited in the car while Crater “cased” it. When Crater returned to the car, he reported that Ritchie’s probably was not a very lucrative target, but Nolen and Evans decided to go through with the robbery anyway. Armed with handguns, their faces masked, Nolen and Evans then went into the bar while Crater waited outside in the getaway car. Shortly after they went inside, Crater heard three shots and Nolen and <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>Evans came running out. As the three sped off, Nolen said that he had shot someone. The person shot was Mr. Ritchie, the proprietor of the bar. He died from an abdominal wound inflicted by a .38 caliber handgun.</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[158,541,1143,578]]]'>On November 24, 1981, three days later, Crater was arrested on an unrelated matter. During transportation to his arraignment, after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, he answered questions put to him by police officers concerning the Ritchie homicide. In his statement, Crater implicated Nolen and Evans as the other participants in the Ritchie murder. He also told police how the three planned to rob the bar, how he retrieved what was to become the murder weapon from safe-keeping for use in the robbery, and how after the robbery, he disposed of the gun by throwing it in a creek.</p>

If we permit a jury to infer that a co-indictee’s testimony is biased because he <em>may </em>receive favorable treatment, we cannot logically preclude the jury from drawing the same inference when the co-indictee may <em>have already received </em>favorable treatment. “Whatever tends to show the interest or feeling of a witness in a cause is competent by way of cross-examination.” <em>Commonwealth v.
