NWRA attacks regulations recently issued by the Environmental Quality Board governing the method of determining acceptable phosphorus levels in water, including those waters under NWRA’s jurisdiction. NWRA contends these regulations inadequately protect the waters under its jurisdiction against future pollution. The new regulations rely on a model for estimating overall phosphorus levels will directly control only point discharge of pollutants instead of setting specific numeric limits for phosphorus. NWRA claims the model is inadequate and likely to result in future unacceptable phosphorus levels in its water supply as a result of general run-off from farms, residences and commercial establishments. Commonwealth Court properly determined that NWRA was not entitled to pre-enforcement relief from these regulations under our recent decision in <em>Arsenal Coal v. Commonwealth, Department of Environmental Resources, </em><a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">505 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">477 A.2d 1333</a> (1984). In <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>a regulated business defensively attacked the validity of a regulation DER imposed on it as invalid under a specific statutory provision. Here, appellant takes the offense seeking to compel an agency to subject others to more stringent regulation for appellant’s benefit. Unlike <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>this statute does not require separate treatment for phosphorus and the regulation causes no direct and immediate harm to appellant. We therefore affirm Commonwealth Court.</p>

Those regulations removed a specific numeric level for allowable phosphorus <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>content and implemented a general model for determining whether a particular waterway contained too much phosphorus. NWRA alleges that this change would result in increased pollution of the waters of the Commonwealth generally and its waters specifically. It claimed that the model was not scientifically sound as it assumes that phosphorus in the water comes from point-source discharge into the water as opposed to general runoff. Thus, NWRA alleges that the new regulations would result in decreased water quality in violation of statutory and constitutional requirements to protect the environment.</p>

It was therefore entitled to an appeal to this Court as of right and appropriately filed a notice of appeal to this Court. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 761, 723. In <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>we noted that the Environmental Hearing Board did not have jurisdiction to conduct pre-enforcement review of regulations issued by the Department at the request of parties directly and immediately affected by those regulations. Because there was no other administrative tribunal available for that purpose, we held that it was possible in certain limited situations for a party directly affected by the application of the regulations to bring an action within Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction to determine their validity-</p>

      <em>Arsenal Coal </em>involved an attack on a general strip mining regulation which directly and immediately affected the anthracite industry. The legislature and the Congress had granted partial exemptions to the anthracite industry from the general regulatory authority over surface mining of coal because of anthracite’s unique characteristics. DER had nevertheless issued a single regulation governing all surface mining of coal, without recognizing the special <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>statutory treatment accorded anthracite. We held that the statutory review process was inadequate in that case because the company would suffer direct and immediate harm by not being able to immediately challenge the regulations. Simply stated, to challenge a regulation after <em>Arsenal Coal </em>a party must either establish that its activity is subject to the regulation or that the regulation itself directly causes actual, present harm.</p>

    <blockquote id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[304,1229,1104,1109]]]'>[Appellant’s] sole complaint is that if DER implements regulations which allow a greater phosphorus discharge into the Neshaminy and Core Creeks, its goal of making these waters unpolluted and safe for contact recreation will be thwarted. The regulations, however, do not in and of themselves permit a greater phosphorus discharge into the waters; the amended regulations specifically state that existing point sources of phosphorus discharge which are currently subject to phosphorus controls will continue to operate at present levels. <a href="/citations/?q=25%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2093.9" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="25 Pa.

The status quo will continue until DER, upon application or reapplication for a permit by a new or existing discharger, evaluates the water quality of the stream in question and imposes appropriate phosphorus discharge limitations based upon its evaluation. The eventual impact of the amended regulations upon [Appellant], therefore, is at this point in time uncertain. It is not direct or immediate. In contradistinction to the situation in <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>the case at bar presents a situation where requiring [Appellant] to challenge DER’s application of the regulations to individual phosphorus dischargers on a case-by-case basis will be a more efficient process than to have this Court speculate as to what steps DER may take to implement the amended regulations with respect to the Neshaminy and Core Creeks. Because [Appellant] will not be subjected to direct and immediate harm, the statutory review process is an adequate and appropriate remedy and this Court must refrain from exercising its equitable jurisdiction. <em>See Arsenal Coal, </em><a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">505 Pa. at 208</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">477 A.2d at 1338</a>.</blockquote>

    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[271,720,1146,921]]]'>Appellant contends, however, the law requires prevention, not cure, and therefore the remedies available to it after pollution occurs are insufficient. Thus, it also claims immediate harm in an inability to protect its waters from phosphorus pollution because of the change in the regulations. It further claims that it will be unable to maintain a private action to prevent nuisances without the Departmental standard as a guide. These arguments are without merit. The prophylactic control and the choice of methods by which prophylaxis is effected are entrusted to the Department. As the Commonwealth points out, it has authority under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102 to control pollution caused by erosion and general runoff of pollutants. In addition, the Clean Streams Law provides for citizen enforcement suits at all time. 35 P.S. § 691.601 (Supp.1985). Thus, there are other methods beyond the regulations at issue here to control phosphorus.</p>
