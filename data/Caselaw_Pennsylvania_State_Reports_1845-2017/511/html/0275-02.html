Consequently, the court held invalid the actions of the Appellant, City of Allentown, closing enrollment in the City’s Paid Firemen’s Pension Fund (Pension Fund) as of July 8, 1976 and mandating enrollment of all firemen hired after that date in the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System (Retirement System). Because of the importance of the question for municipalities throughout the Commonwealth, we granted allocatur to review this interpretation of the statute.</p>

Subsequent collective bargaining agreements between the City and Local 302 of the International Association of Firefighters, including the agreement in effect between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 1977, made reference to this Pension Fund. In 1976, with the passage of Ordinance No. 12185, the City closed membership in the Pension Fund and elected to join the Retirement System established by the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement Law, Act of February 1, 1974, P.L. 34, No. 15, 53 P.S. §§ 881.101-881.501.

The Appellees Roxberry, Sell, and Klechner, three firemen hired after the effective date of Ordinance No. 12185, and Local 302, their union, sought an order declaring the Ordinance invalid, construing the collective bargaining agree<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>ment so as to require the City to enroll all firefighters, including those hired after June 8, 1976 in the Pension Fund, and enjoining the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement Board from accepting further contributions for the Retirement System on their behalf. Resort to the grievance procedure provided for in the collective bargaining agreement was waived by the parties. Commonwealth Court determined that it had neither original nor appellate jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County. That court dismissed the action against the Board for lack of jurisdiction. Having received a stipulation of facts and cross-motions for summary judgment, the court determined that the City’s actions did not violate the contractual rights of the Union or its individual members. The court also held that the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement Law permitted the City to maintain the local Pension Fund for those firemen enrolled prior to June 8, 1976, and join the Retirement System for all firemen hired after that date. Because of the absence of any factual dispute, the court granted the City’s motion for summary judgment and denied the summary judgment motion of the Petitioners/Appellees. As previously noted, the Commonwealth Court reversed based on a contrary reading of the statute.</p>

    <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[265,476,1144,998]]]'>The foundation of the Commonwealth Court’s analysis is the third paragraph of this section. The court read this language to mean that under no circumstances could two retirement systems exist for municipal firemen; either all firemen would be required to be covered by the Retirement System or none of the firemen could be so covered. Finding that this section is “clear and can be interpreted in only one manner,” the court applied the rule of statutory construction which holds that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit,” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b), and concluded that the City’s Ordinance attempting to enroll only new firemen in the Retirement System was invalid.. Given this interpretation of paragraph three, the court’s implicit understanding of the first paragraph was that a municipality’s decision to join the Retirement System could not become effective without an affirmative vote of seventy-five per cent of the members of the existing pension fund. Maj.op. at p. 278-279.</p>

The City reads the first and final paragraphs of the Section as indicating statutory approval of the existence of more than one pension plan for firemen. The first sentence is read as simply providing the means by which an existing plan might be joined into the Retirement System after the municipality has elected to enroll other employees in the Retirement System; the seventy-five per cent vote is understood as an affirmative act unrelated to the municipal decision, not as a veto power over that decision. The last paragraph, according to the City, contains language demonstrating an even clearer legislative approval of dual pension systems. “Not<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>withstanding any other provision herein, the board may, in its discretion, entertain a request from a municipality to join the system established by this act <em>for those employees who are excluded from local pension plan coverage </em>by virtue of the collective bargaining process <em>or </em>otherwise.” 53 P.S. § 881.303 (emphasis added). This language, added to the Act as an amendment in 1980, is argued to manifestly require the conclusion that two separate pension plans may exist, one local and the other the Retirement System for persons excluded from the local system.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[163,853,1145,947]]]'>Proceeding from these premises the City argues that the third paragraph of Section 881.303, if it is to be given meaning, as it must, should be read as imposing compulsory membership in the Retirement System on only those firefighters for whom the City elects to join the Retirement System. Because the Ordinance enrolls firefighters hired after its effective date, only those firefighters are required to become members of the Retirement System. Such firefighters are “excluded from local pension plan coverage” because of the Ordinance and are therefore candidates for enrollment in the Retirement System under the final paragraph of the Section. They are likewise not “eligible to join” the local pension system and therefore are not precluded from joining the Retirement System by the first paragraph. Compulsory membership co-extensive with the municipality’s election to enroll employees, not universal membership for all employees of the enrolled class, is said to be the proper interpretation of the third paragraph.</p>

In a sense, both parties to this dispute are correct. The language of the third paragraph, viewed in isolation, provides a seemingly clear indication that membership in the Retirement System is compulsory for <em>all </em>firefighters if the municipality elects to join the system for its firefighters. Comparison with the parallel language of Section 881.203 regarding compulsory membership for nonuniformed employees strengthens this interpretation. “If a municipality elects to join the system under the provisions of this Article II, then each officer other than elected officers, and each employe thereof other than a municipal fireman and a municipal policeman, employed on a permanent basis, except one who is not eligible for Federal Social Security coverage <em>and except one who is covered by an existing retirement or pension system and is exempted as outlined above, </em>shall be required to become a member of the system.” 53 P.S. § 881.203 (emphasis added). The existence of this <em>explicit </em>exception to compulsory Retirement System membership for members of existing pension systems weighs against reading a similar <em>implicit </em>exception into Section 303.</p>

Such a power was explicitly granted under the former law applicable to police<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but the language <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>granting this power was not retained under the Act. Section 790.6 of Title 53 provided that “[a]ny municipality may elect, by ordinance or resolution, to join the [police] retirement system created by this act: Provided, however, That when a municipality is maintaining an existing retirement or pension system for its police, the ordinance shall not affect membership in the retirement system created by this act <em>unless and until approval is voted </em>by seventy-five percent of_the membership of the existing pension or retirement system <em>as provided for in section 15 </em>of this act.” (Emphasis added) Section 15 of the act contained the identical provisions now found in Section 303. Following the rules of construction that “the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters ... [t]he former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(5), and that a change in language is ordinarily to be considered as expressing a change in intention, it would appear that approval by the existing pension system was no longer intended to be necessary to give effect to the municipality’s decision to join the Retirement System. This conclusion is strengthened by reference to Section 113 of the present Act, 53 P.S. § 881.113, setting out the General Provisions governing the Retirement System. There, the only proviso attached to a decision to join the system is placement of employees under the Federal Social Security Act to the full extent of their eligibility. Other than this requirement, the municipality’s election is apparently unconditional.</p>

Alternatively the Appellant’s interpretation, based on a strict reading of the first paragraph (and supported by a later amendment contained in the final paragraph), requires that a limitation on the compulsory membership provision be implied, although it is not written in the statutory language. In view of the overall scheme of the Act, whereby a municipality’s “election” to join the Retirement System is established solely as a policy decision of the governing body or of the electorate,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> we find it preferable not to imply a limitation on this public power in favor of the private interests of existing pension funds. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(5). Rather than give the third paragraph the same meaning it would have if read in isolation and thereby render nugatory the power of the municipality to decide on joining the Retirement System granted by another provision of the same Act, we choose to interpret this part more restrictively in order to give some meaning to each portion of the statute. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2). Given the administrative interpretation of the Act, the acquiesence in that interpretation implicit in the legislature’s later amendment without “correcting” the regulations, and the potential consequences of interpreting the <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>Act so as to invalidate all “two-tier” pension arrangements including those agreeable to all parties, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(6), we hold that Article III of the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement Law permits a municipality to require enrollment of one group of police or firemen in the Retirement System, while leaving for vote of the members of another group — those enrolled in an existing pension fund— the decision whether or not to join the Retirement System. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court’s holding on this issue is disapproved.</p>

The Act provides generally the procedures whereby a municipality may elect to join the Retirement System. Among the possibilities permitted by the statute, implicitly as originally written and explicitly following the 1980 amendment, is the enrollment of employees not covered by an existing pension plan. Nothing in the language of the Act speaks to the reason why employees might not be covered by an existing plan; it is merely provided that the Board may, in its discretion, permit the municipality to enroll such employees in the Retirement System. It is a separate question, entirely unrelated to the statute, whether or not the municipality has acted properly in creating the class of non-covered employees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>In opposition to this conclusion the City argues that previous decisions of this Court permit a public employer to alter the terms of a pension plan for those employees whose rights had not yet vested if the changes were necessary to enhance the actuarial soundness of the fund. <em>See, e.g., Harvey v. Allegheny County Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/392/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="392 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="8845571" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0421-01">392 Pa. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20197" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="141 A.2d 197">141 A.2d 197</a> (1958); <em>Retirement Board of Allegheny County v. McGovern, </em><a href="/pa/316/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="316 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1158999" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0161-01">316 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=174%20A.%20400" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="174 A. 400">174 A. 400</a> (1934). In pursuing this argument, the City fails to consider the impact of Act 111 on these decisions permitting limited alteration of pension plans by public employers. It would appear that by including retirement and pensions in the items which policemen and firemen have a right to bargain, the legislature has evidenced an intention that the public employer no longer has exclusive control over the structure of pension systems. Once the matter is included in a collective bargaining agreement, it becomes, like any other contractual provision, binding on the parties to the agreement. An implicit power reserved by the public employer to unilaterally alter a bargained for provision in the contract would render the bargaining process established by Act 111 entirely illusory. We find no warrant in the language of the Retirement Act or elsewhere to impute such an intention to the legislature. We also note that since the decision of the trial court a majority of this Court has repudiated the “actuarial enhancement” rule and held that a unilateral change in retirement benefits to non-vested members cannot pass constitutional muster under Article I, § 17, of the State Constitution, prohibiting the impairment of contracts. <em>Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties v.

The record is wholly inadequate to sustain the City’s position. The only “evidence" remotely related to the question of the actuarial soundness of the Pension Fund is an unsworn, undated "Statement of Financial Impact" prepared by the Director of the Department of Administration and Finance. At best, this statement details the effect that a decision requiring the City to continue the Pension Fund would have on the <em>financial condition of the City. </em>It bears little, if any, relevance to the issue of the <em>actuarial soundness of the Pension Fund. </em>Further, it does not appear that this document was placed in evidence before the trial court, nor does it appear that the issue was otherwise addressed by the parties below. A review of the pleadings indicates no basis for the trial court’s conclusion that the plaintiffs-appellees had failed to deny the City’s allegation that the reason for passage of Ordinance No. 12185 was to arrest the pending bankruptcy of the Pension Fund. Indeed, the pleadings contain no such allegation by the City, which filed only an Answer containing no New Matter in response to the Petition for Review. Even had the issue been properly placed before the court, the question of whether the changes were necessary to preserve the actuarial integrity of the Pension Fund would be a question of fact rendering the issue inappropriate for summary judgment. Thus the court erred in accepting the representations of the City that the purpose of the Ordinance was to preserve the financial integrity of the Pension Fund, and further erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of those representations.</p>
