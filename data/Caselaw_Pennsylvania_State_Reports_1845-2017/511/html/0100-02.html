In determining liability for the Tax, Gilberti excluded from his calculation of gross receipts such income as he maintained was derived from on-site supervision of a construction project outside the City limits.

Further, it is established that statutes authorizing political subdivisions to levy taxes are to be strictly construed insofar as the scope of the power granted, and any doubt concerning the scope of the taxing power, to wit in this case doubt as to whether the taxpayer’s on-site activities could be taxed as transactions in the City, must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the political subdivision. <em>Fischer v.

To regard it otherwise would be to ignore the significance of the two subjects for taxation having been separately stated in the Enabling Act.

This Court agreed and held that only receipts from intrastate commerce, as opposed to interstate commerce, could be subject to the tax.

In the <em>City Stores </em>case, an ordinance had been enacted under the authority of the Sterling Act, and the ordinance imposed a tax upon “[e]very person who makes, executes, issues, or delivers any document the amount of the tax being determined by the value represented by the document. The Sterling Act, Act of August 5, 1932, P.L. 45, as amended, 53 P.S. § 15971 et seq., formerly 53 P.S. § 4613 et seq., is the equivalent of the Local Tax Enabling Act for cities of the first class. The Sterling Act authorized the city to levy taxes “on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property, <em>within the limits </em>of such city.” (Emphasis added.) In <em>City Stores, </em>settlement of a real estate sale was held outside the city, and this Court held that every taxable event involving documents took place outside the taxing district. The ordinance in <em>Philadelphia Appeal, </em>supra., employed almost exactly the same language as that found in the ordinance in the <em>City Stores </em>case. In <em>Philadelphia Appeal, </em>it was similarly held that, since settlement of a real estate sale took place outside the taxing district, every possible taxable event was also performed outside the taxing district. The <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>city had argued that the ordinance imposed a tax on the “privilege” of transferring real estate, and that the tax was therefore applicable without regard to whether settlement documents were made, issued, or delivered inside the city limits. This Court concluded that, even if this inference could be drawn from the language of the ordinance, the <em>exercise </em>of the privilege was performed outside the taxing district, and that it was the <em>exercise </em>of the privilege that the ordinance must be understood as subjecting to a tax. The Court held that, because the Sterling Act permitted taxes to be imposed only on “privileges ... within the limits of such city,” only such exercises of the privilege of transferring real property as in fact occurred within the city limits could be subject to the tax in question. Indeed, the Court noted,</p>
    <blockquote id="AEH" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[293,1039,1101,308]]]'>[E]ven if the ordinance ... was intended to impose a tax on the transfer, outside the City of Philadelphia, of property within the City, such intention would have been futile, as held in the <em>City Stores </em>Company case, because of the limitations on the City’s authority in that respect contained in the Sterling Act.</blockquote>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[247,1370,1144,678]]]'>In the instant case, the limitations on a political subdivision’s power to tax privileges, under the Enabling Act, are identical to the limitations found in the Sterling Act, in that only privileges “within the limits” of the political subdivision may be taxed. Thus, in accordance with the <em>City Stores </em>and <em>Philadelphia Appeal </em>decisions, where the City imposes a tax upon a privilege, the tax cannot be levied directly upon exercises of the privilege that occur outside of the taxing district. The privilege of doing business in the City, like the privilege of owning and transferring property involved in the <em>City Stores </em>and <em>Philadelphia Appeal </em>cases, can be taxed only to the extent that the , exercise of the privilege occurs within the City.</p>

Nevertheless, the tax remains one that is levied only upon a privilege exercised within the City, to wit maintenance of a business office, and the fact that the amount of tax is dependent upon the taxpayer’s gross receipts, including receipts from services performed outside the City, does not undermine the legitimacy of the tax.</p>
    <p id="b151-4" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[141,971,1145,961]]]'>In support of this conclusion it is to be emphasized that the plain language of the Enabling Act provides for taxes to be levied upon privileges within the City. In enacting such a provision, the legislature surely recognized that the exercise by a taxpayer of the privilege of doing business within a taxing jurisdiction constitutes far more than the sum of individual transactions and activities which are consummated or performed within the territorial limits of the taxing entity. Indeed, having a place of business within the City enables the taxpayer to have a base of operations from which to manage, direct, and control business activities occurring both inside and outside the City limits. Further, the in-City office provides a place from which to solicit business, accept communications, conduct meetings, store supplies, and perform office work. All of these activities are, in the usual course, necessary to any business operation. This is so irrespective of whether the business performs services at job sites outside of the City.</p>
    <p id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[141,1962,1143,366]]]'>In recognition of this, we believe the legislature has provided for the City to collect a tax upon the privilege of having a place of business in the City, and the measure of that tax is not to be so limited as to ignore the contribution to out-of-City activities provided by maintaining a base of operations within the City. The decision of Commonwealth Court to the contrary, therefore, must be reversed.</p>

      <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>We note that the City has argued that, if the scope of the Tax were limited so as to exclude revenues from services performed outside the City, the City’s collection efforts would be substantially hindered, that it would be difficult to separate taxable revenues from non-taxable ones, and that City revenues would be substantially decreased. Such consequences, whether or not they in fact would occur, have not been regarded by this Court as relevant to the legal issue presented, i.e., the extent of the tax power conferred by the Enabling Act. The City may adopt authorized taxes which it regards itself as capable of enforcing, but the fact that it might not be capable of enforcing to its satisfaction any given tax is not an argument to be given weight in the consideration of whether the City has the power to adopt such a tax in the first instance.</p>
