For example, under the former section 2003, the Commonwealth could acquire fee simple title to land used for the erection of buildings necessary in connection with the construction or maintenance of highways. <em>See </em>Administrative Code of 1929, <em>supra </em>at section 2003, 71 P.S. § 513(e). However, the power to appropriate private property for the actual construction of state highways was effected only by way of an easement which allowed for reversion to the owner should the transportation use ever be abandoned. <em>See </em>State Highway Law, <em>supra, </em>36 P.S. § 670-210. Additionally, for the payment of damages in connection with condemnation for the construction of limited access highways, it was necessary for the Secretary of Highways to proceed under section 8 of the Limited Access Highway Law, <em>supra, </em>36 P.S. § 2391.8. The procedure for the disposition of property by sale or otherwise was set forth in section 410 of the Eminent Domain Code, Act of June 22, 1964, P.L. 84, No. 6, 26 P.S. § 1-410. Act 1979-100 eliminated the necessity to resort to these various provisions by setting forth in the amended section 2003 one procedure to apply to all condemnations for transportation purposes. It should be noted <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>that all of the former provisions amended, superseded, or repealed by Act 1979-100 dealt with <em>the powers and duties of the Department of Transportation relating to real property.</em>

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[137,575,1146,1220]]]'>As the above discussion illustrates, the changes effected by Act 1979-100 were not limited just to the grant of a fee simple acquisition by the Department of Transportation. Rather, the changes encompassed many of <em>the powers and duties of the Secretary of Transportation as to real property. </em>The title was therefore generic, so as to be comprehensive. Under these circumstances, a short, general, comprehensive title is more desirable than a long one which attempts to point out all the details of a statute. <em>Minsinger v. Rau, </em><a href="/pa/236/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="236 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="986701" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0327-01">236 Pa. 327</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20902" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="84 A. 902">84 A. 902</a> (1912). This comprehensive title was sufficient to place interested parties on notice that Act 1979-100 could relate to the Department’s power to acquire real property for transportation purposes. As noted above, the title of an act serves only to place the legislators and the public on notice of the act’s contents; it was never intended to serve as a substitute for one’s reading the act to ascertain its full impact upon the existing laws. As our case law has established, Article III, Section 3 does not require that the title be an index or synopsis of the act’s contents. <em>McSorley v. Fitzgerald, supra; LJW Realty, supra; Gumpert’s Estate, supra. </em>Appellees, therefore, can assert no absolute right to a detailed title.</p>
