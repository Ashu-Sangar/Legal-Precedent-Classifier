The victim was intoxicated and had a blood alcohol content of .356 per cent. He was pronounced dead at the York Hospital at 10:58 p.m. that evening.</p>

Ms. Emmil testified that she, appellant and another couple had been drinking in a bar until just before the stabbing. The four left to go to another bar, and were walking on South Penn Street when the victim crossed the street carrying a six-pack of beer and asked the group if anyone wanted some beer.</p>

Ms. Emmil had previously been the victim’s girlfriend, but left him and began to live with appellant. The victim harassed her after that, and threatened her on several occasions. Appellant had spoken with the victim, who had a bad reputation for violence in the community, in an attempt to get him to quit harassing Ms. Emmil, but to no avail. Near the end of May, 1983, appellant was involved in a serious altercation with the victim wherein the latter, without apparent provocation, hit appellant in the face with a hatchet, knocking appellant unconscious and fracturing his jaw. Appellant was hospitalized and had to have his jaw wired in place.</p>

According to Ms. Emmil, appellant took a knife <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>from his pocket and, without provocation, stabbed the victim in the chest. The four inch blade of the knife pierced through his sternum and severed the top of his heart, and the victim fell to the sidewalk unconscious and died shortly thereafter.</p>

The owner of the house happened to be the attorney for the City of York. He found the knife and handkerchief in his tomato garden the following morning and turned the items in to the police; they had not been there earlier on the evening of September 30, 1983. Appellant and Ms. Emmil then met the other couple at the bar as planned, and had some drinks.</p>

Initially, Ms. Emmil was frightened and did not tell the police what she knew about the stabbing when first questioned, but eventually she told them that appellant had stabbed the victim.

Appellant said that he did not go to the police because he wanted to cover up for his girlfriend, Ms. Emmil. He further stated that after the stabbing, he had asked a friend to purchase a knife similar to the one used by Ms. Emmil to confuse the police who, he was sure, would suspect him for the stabbing because of his known animosity toward the victim. Appellant admitted that he had had <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>ill feelings towards the victim and that he had threatened revenge shortly after the victim had broken his jaw with the hatchet, but that his desire for revenge had subsided with the passage of time and that he eventually decided to forget about the incident. According to appellant, however, Ms. Emmil could not forget about the incident or the victim’s harassment of her, and she became increasingly more distraught and fearful of the victim.</p>

Pursuant to the Sentencing Code, a sentencing hearing was conducted immediately thereafter before the same jury. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(a). The Commonwealth introduced evidence to establish only one aggravating circumstance, that the appellant had <em>“a </em>significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(9). This significant history consisted of a felony conviction for murder of the third degree and a felony conviction (arising from a separate incident) for assault by a prisoner. 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2502(c) and 2703, respectively. The jury was instructed as to three possible mitigating circumstances, namely that “the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,” that “the defendant acted under extreme duress ... or acted under the substantial domination of another person,” and “other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offenses.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(2, 5 and 8, respectively). The jury found that appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, which aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating circumstances, and sentenced appellant to death. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(iv).</p>

The specific intent to kill was supported by the inference that appellant’s unprovoked use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim’s body (i.e., piercing his sternum and cutting off the top of the victim’s heart) was intended to kill him. <em>Commonwealth v.

At the beginning of his testimony, Mr. Jefferies was asked “How are you employed?,” and he answered: “Pennsylvania Board of Parole, Parole Agent.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), January 18, 1983, Vol. II at 47. The witness was then asked whether he knew the appellant and whether he had a conversation with him concerning an injury he sustained. The witness answered that he did know appellant, and recounted the conversation he had with appellant about appellant’s broken jaw. Appellant told the witness that he did not know who his attacker was, and declined the witness’ suggestions that he go to the police.

This is a non sequiter. These items that appellant perceives as mitigating under section (e)(3) would not go to his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, but would go to whether he acted under “extreme mental or emotiotial disturbance” or “extreme duress” or “substantial domination of another,” all of which are possibly mitigating circumstances which were submitted to the jury for its consideration. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(2) and (5), respectively.
