Pursuant to the Township’s zoning ordinance, a detached single-family dwelling is a permitted use in an “R-2” district; but convalescent homes, nursing homes and boarding houses are not.

In 1976 the number rose to four; and from 1977 onward there were seven. In return for a fee of approximately $200.00 a month per individual, Mrs. Miller provided them with room, board, some transportation, supervision in grooming, and monitoring of personal needs. The Miller house, in addition to accommodating the several paying residents, was the residence of Mrs. Miller and her foster daughter. Another resident of the home was a Mrs. Hart, who, in return for bed and board, assisted in the care of the paying residents.

Alfred Bettman in a law review article written in 1924 stated the proposition that “promotion of the single family home ... is deemed good public policy in America.” Bettman, <em>Constitutionality of Zoning, </em><a href="/citations/?q=37%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20834" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="37 Harv. L. Rev. 834">37 Harv.L.Rev. 834</a>, 839-40 (1924). From that point “zoning spread swiftly, particularly in suburban communities.” J.R. Richards, <em>Zoning For Direct Social Control, </em>5 Duke Law Journal 761, 767 (1982). At an early stage of that development the legitimacy of exclusive single-family districts was settled. However, the question that emerged was how, if at all, a given ordinance should define the term “family.” Initially, a significant number of ordinances resolved that issue by leaving the word undefined. <em>See, e.g., </em>Baltimore, Md., Code art. 49, § 1 (1928); Birmingham, Ala., General Code Ordinance 1101-C, art. I, § 1 (1930). The consequence <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>of that approach was to leave the resolution of the meaning of the term “single family” to the courts. <em>See, e.g., Brady v.

One of the early formulations used to define “family” within the terms of those provisions was that of a “single housekeeping unit.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>See, e.g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em><a href="/us/272/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="272 U.S. 365" data-case-ids="1501273" data-case-paths="/us/272/0365-01">272 U.S. 365</a>, <a href="/us/272/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="47 S.

The ordinance in effect, in the instant Township prior to the 1978 amendment, used the “housekeeping unit” formulation. Regrettably, this attempt to define “family” did not supply the degree of clarity it was intended to provide. A review of the cases throughout the country indicates that the change served only to focus the litigation upon a determination as to the meaning of a “housekeeping unit.” In those cases interpreting zoning ordinances wherein the “family” limitation had been defined as a “single housekeeping unit,” many extended family groups were deemed to fall within that category. The use of this test was viewed as extending beyond the occupancy by a one-family unit to a determination as to whether it was a one-housekeeping unit. <em>See Neptune Park Ass’n v. Steinberg, </em><a href="/conn/138/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="138 Conn. 357" data-case-ids="1589709" data-case-paths="/conn/138/0357-01">138 Conn. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20687" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="84 A.2d 687">84 A.2d 687</a> (1951). The focus was on whether the unit functioned as a family unit, rather than on the respective relationships that existed between the members of the unit. <em>See, e.g., City of Syracuse v.

The area in question was zoned as an R-4 residential district, where single-family dwellings were permitted. Under the ordinance the term “family” was defined as “ ... a group of persons living as a single household unit ..., but not to include more than three persons unrelated by blood, marriage or adoption.” The society was required to seek a use certificate since the children were not related by “blood, marriage or adoption.” The Commonwealth Court held that the certificate of use should be issued. What is of interest to this discussion is that there was no question raised as to compliance with that portion of the definition of “family” requiring a “single household unit.” The lack of a blood or marital relationship between the members of the unit became relevant only because of the specific requirement of the ordinance there in question. We also note that the court in <em>Children’s Aid Society </em>relied upon a functional analysis of the unit to reach its result. It <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>determined that the society’s proposed use of the property was virtually identical to that which would exist in the case of the permissible use by a family with six children.

That decision involved a proposed foster home for troubled adolescents who were referred by the courts.

Here again the functional analysis was employed, and the Commonwealth Court determined that the use in that case was not a family type dwelling but rather an institutional corrective setting. It therefore becomes apparent that the “single housekeeping unit” evolved as a term limiting the use to a unit that functions in the manner of a family residence. It did not require that any particular relationship between the members of the unit be demonstrated as long as a family residential setting was apparent. <em>Carroll, Berger v.

We are of the view that the facts on this record do not support such a conclusion. In reaching this conclusion the Board and the courts that affirmed that result have made much over the two hundred dollar a month subsidy paid by some of the residents in the home. This rate, particularly in view of the special care these residents require, does not suggest a profit motive. We also note that foster children are subsidized by public funds, and that fact has not been determinative of whether the living arrangement constituted a family unit. Similarly, in family units based upon blood and marital relationships the adult members quite frequently contribute to the maintenance of the unit. The mere fact that a member of the unit pays a fee for belonging to the unit does not transform the relationship unless it also appears that the profit motive is the basis for the relationship.</p>

On the other hand it is clear that this is not a transient establishment but rather that the residents usually remain substantial periods of time and move only for health reasons or personal preference.

It is true that the record indicates that many of the residents are elderly or handicapped adults who have no biological family with which to share a home environment. Thus their needs would necessarily be greater than those of the young healthy adult. It is just this kind of support that the traditional family unit is designed to provide. The fact that these individuals may be aged and infirm, and may offend the sensibilities of some, does not warrant the conclusion that their presence is incompatible with the concept of “family.” They too should have the right to enjoy their remaining years in the more desirable areas of their community and are fortunate to have access to an environment of the type provided by appellant.</p>
