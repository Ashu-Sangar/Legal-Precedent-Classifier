Lomax testified that on June 30, 1979, she returned to her apartment in the early hours of the morning after having spent the evening with her family. At approximately 5:00 a.m. she left her apartment and entered the common hallway of her apartment building to go to the bathroom. While she was in the hall, Eubanks, who lived one floor below Lomax, grabbed her and pulled her downstairs to his apartment. Although she fought and resisted, both in the hall and in the apartment, Eubanks overpowered her and finally raped her in his apartment. Nevertheless, she continued to scream and fight. Lomax was finally rescued when a police officer, who had been alerted by a neighbor that screams were coming from the building, managed to enter the building and burst into Eubanks’ room.</p>

After three cigarettes, they had consensual sex. When Eubanks prepared to leave, Lomax asked him to play a “game” with her. She explained that she was experiencing difficulty becoming sexually aroused because she had shot someone in the head. She then asked Eubanks to go to his apartment and wait for <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>her without putting any clothes on. Eubanks agreed to do this, thinking that she would come down and they would again have sex. Eubanks went to his apartment and Lo-max arrived apparently fully clothed. After Eubanks closed the door, however, Lomax said, “I’m going to fix you,” and threw a pair of panties on the floor which she had been holding in her hand. She then began to shout, “Rape. Help. Rape.” Eubanks testified that he tried to quiet her by grabbing her and covering her mouth, but she continued to shout and fight him. He testified that the shouting and scuffling continued for ten minutes until the police arrived.</p>

Somebody help me.” Shortly after Holmes left the neighbor’s house at 5:30 a.m., he encountered a police car and told the officer about the screams. He accompanied the officer to the house and both could still hear the screams from outside. The officer testified that he entered the house, heard a woman screaming “Help me, please. Don’t do it no more,” and “Rape.” In the hall outside Eubanks’ apartment, he heard a male voice say, “Shut the f— up.” He then burst in the door and discovered Lomax, whom he described as crying hysterically and bruised, with her face swollen.
