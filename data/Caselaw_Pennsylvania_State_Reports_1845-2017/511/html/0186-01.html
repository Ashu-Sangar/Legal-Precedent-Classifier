Because an impasse developed, the Appellant requested the appointment of a board of arbitration as authorized by Section 4(a) of Act 111. Section 4(a) provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AFl" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[204,737,1101,404]]]'>If in any case of a dispute between a public employer and its policemen ... the collective bargaining process reaches an impasse and stalemate, ... with the result that said employers and employes are unable to effect a settlement, than either party to the dispute, after written notice to the other party containing specifications of the issue or issues in dispute, may request the appointment of a board of arbitration.</blockquote>

    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[255,421,1144,917]]]'>In denying the Appellant’s petition, the lower court held that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority or determine an issue not in dispute when they eliminated post-retirement medical benefits. In so doing, the court held that a retired police officer is not a township employee and therefore, the township could not provide lifetime post-retirement medical insurance coverage. Likewise, the lower court held that the Appellant made the length of the contract an “issue in dispute” by attempting to limit the term of the award to one year. Finally, the lower court disagreed with the Appellant’s argument that Section 3 of Act 111 prohibited the granting of a multi-year award. Commonwealth Court affirmed on appeal, holding that the issues of the post-retirement medical benefits and the length of the contract term were properly before the Board, and determined within the scope of the Board’s authority. We granted the Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal and now would affirm in part and would reverse in part.</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[253,1355,1152,770]]]'>Section 7 of Act 111 specifically prohibits any appeal from an arbitration award. However, we have consistently held that this prohibition does not prevent a court from reviewing an arbitration award when an appeal questions (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrators; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) question of excess in exercise of powers; and (4) constitutional questions. <em>Guthrie v.

As the result of an arbitration under Act 111, the City was required to pay for hospitalization for the families of their police officers. The City challenged this award as an excess of the arbitrators’ powers. In making our determination we relied upon Article 3, Section 31 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and <em>Harney v. Russo, </em><a href="/pa/435/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="435 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1924190" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0183-01">435 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=255%20A.2d%20560" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="255 A.2d 560">255 A.2d 560</a> (1969).

    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[149,1482,1144,361]]]'>In <em>Harney, </em>we held that arbitrators may not violate due process or enabling legislation in conducting their hearings and making awards. Even though the enabling legislation did not specify the powers of an arbitration panel, we held that an arbitration panel could not mandate an illegal act nor require a governmental body to perform an act which it could not voluntarily undertake.</p>
    <p id="b233-7" data-blocks='[["BL_233.7",233,[149,1860,1143,358]]]'>Thus we concluded that under the Third Class City Code, the Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 927, 53 P.S. § 37403, the City was specifically prohibited from paying premiums for any person not an employee. Therefore, to require the City to comply with the arbitration award would result in the City performing an illegal act. This clearly was not the intent of Article 3, Section 31 of our Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b233-8" data-blocks='[["BL_233.8",233,[150,2238,1140,96]],["BL_234.1",234,[250,305,1141,201]]]'>In this appeal, the Appellant argues that the arbitrators erred in terminating the retirees’ health benefits when both <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>parties were only disputing the time of entitlement. Thus, we must determine whether the township would violate any law by providing health coverage after retirement. If so, then the termination of retirees’ health benefits was proper.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[247,528,1143,516]]]'>As a creature of the Commonwealth, a township has no inherent powers and may do only those things which the legislature permits. <em>Matter of Arbitration Between Borough Of Ambridge And the Police Department, </em>53 Pa.Commonwealth 251, <a href="/citations/?q=417%20A.2d%20291" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="417 A.2d 291">417 A.2d 291</a> (1980). As such, the legislature has enacted the First Class Township Code, the Act of June 24, 1931, P.L. 1206, Article 1, Section 101, 53 P.S. § 55101, which enumerates the powers of a First Class Township.

    <p id="AuW" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[244,1593,1144,627]]]'>53 P.S. § 56523. As a prerequisite for the township paying a premium for health and life insurance, a person must be an employee of the township. Once a person retires, he is no longer an employee of that business entity. Therefore, a township may not pay a premium for a nonemployee. Accordingly, if a township were to do so, it would be performing an illegal act. Thus, the arbitrators acted properly in terminating the post-retirement medical benefit coverage, for the last two (2) years of the award since the retirees were no longer employees of the township. Likewise, granting health benefits for the first year of the award was improper and to that extent the award must be vacated.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[244,2237,1141,96]],["BL_235.1",235,[157,303,1142,609]]]'>Next, Appellant argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by awarding a three-year term when it only <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>requested a one-year award and the Appellee did not propose anything to the contrary. If the record supported the Appellant’s argument, then our conclusions might differ. However, on the present record it is unclear as to whether the Appellant only requested a one-year award and whether Appellee acquiesced in such a proposal. Since there is no transcript of the proceedings before the Board and the award does not discuss the positions of the parties, we are compelled to make a determination of whether the arbitrators exceeded their power in awarding a three-year term based upon our reading of the Appellant’s proposal initiating the arbitration proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[155,933,1145,1224]]]'>As previously indicated, Act 111 is not specific as to the powers of the arbitrators. Section 4 provides that either party may notify the other party of the specific issues in dispute and does not require the non-moving party to file a reply. Appellant argues that by captioning its proposal for the “1983 contract term”, and by the Appellee’s failure to request a longer term in its proposal, the Appellee acquiesced in a one-year term. Although, the Appellant does caption its proposal for “1983 contract year”, the enumerated provisions do not clearly indicate that Appellant only requested a one-year term. In fact, two of the provisions evince a term in excess of one year. The wage provision requests a seven percent increase in wages in addition to a cost of living adjustment (COLA). If the Appellant only requested a one-year term as indicated by the proposals designation, then a COLA would be unnecessary. With respect to eye care, the Appellant requested an eye examination “every twelve months” (R. 22a). Once again, if this proposal was only for one year, this provision would be unnecessary. Since the Appellant’s proposal does not support the conclusion that the term of the award was not at issue, we are compelled to hold that the arbitrators did not exceed their power in awarding a three-year agreement.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[155,2186,1143,140]]]'>Finally, Appellant argues that the arbitrators acted improperly in awarding a three-year contract in violation of Section 3 of Act 111. Section 3 states:</p>

That court found that the term of the award was an issue in dispute to be decided by the Board and also found that any award for post retirement medical benefits would have been illegal. The Commonwealth Court affirmed as to the term of the award but held that the medical benefits issue was properly before the Board. That Court found that the Board had fashioned an “equitable resolution” based on give and take of economic benefits. The opinion in support of affirmance is now upholding the award by ruling that the term of the award was properly before the Board and ruling that awarding post retirement medical benefits would be illegal.</p>

Appellate review of an Act 111 arbitation award is limited to review of (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrators; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) questions of excess in exercise of powers, and (4) constitutional questions. <em>City of Washington v.

The narrower question in the instant case is to determine if the Board exceeded its “exercise of powers” by both deciding issues not before it (the term of the award) and by deciding issues beyond the scope of those presented to it (post retirement medical benefits). Act 111 provides, in part:</p>

    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[176,478,1144,638]]]'>This provision becomes applicable when, among other things, the collective bargaining process reaches an impasse. The reason for turning to arbitration, is to resolve the “issue or issues in dispute.” The Board does not have a free hand in designing a comprehensive agreement but must limit itself to those issues in dispute. The perimeters of the Board’s authority is shaped by the issues submitted to it and any decision beyond those issues submitted is in excess of the Board’s authority. (The proposals and counter-proposals were used by the Board as the “specifications of the issue or issues in dispute,” as required by § 217.4(a) of Act 111.)</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[174,1148,1146,1168]]]'>I agree with the opinion in support of affirmance that there is no prohibition in Act 111 that an arbitration award not exceed one year. However, in the instant case, the term of the award was not an issue before the Board to be decided. Appellant made it clear that the proposals submitted for consideration were only for 1983. In submitting its counter-proposals, appellee made no objection to a contract for one year (1983). Appellee contends that requiring a response to each and every proposal of appellant or requiring appellee to address the length of the contract would, in effect, require a responsive pleading where none is required by statute. § 217.4(a) of Act 111 states, in part, that, “after written notice to the other party containing specifications of the issue or issues in dispute,” a request may be made for the appointment of a board of arbitration. 43 P.S. § 217.4. Neither this court nor the statute requires a formal responsive pleading to issues to be submitted to a board of arbitrators. However, if one party to the arbitration does not agree with the issues or scope thereof to be presented to the arbitrators, it would behoove that party to respond, in writing, as to their position on the issues to be arbitrated.</p>

    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[154,480,1144,1194]]]'>I disagree with the opinion in support of affirmance. First, § 56523 refers to contracting for health insurance for township employes or “any <em>class or classes </em>thereof.” The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 provides, in part, “... [e]very statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a). The opinion in support of affirmance focuses exclusively on the word “employes” contained in the statute and determines that it applies only to present, active employes. However, the statute does not so limit the word “employes”; rather, “employes” is used in conjunction with “class or classes thereof.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines class as “[a] group of persons, things, qualities, or activities having common characteristics or attributes.” Black’s Law Dictionary 225 (5th ed. 1979). “Class or classes” of employes can refer, <em>inter alia, </em>to executive versus legislative employes, appointed versus elected employes and active versus retired employes. All have the characteristic of being or having been employes of the municipality and thus fall within the statutory language of “employes or class or classes thereof” for whom a contract for health insurance can be maintained.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[153,1714,1144,480]]]'>Further, when a person undertakes employment, there is usually a trade-off between present compensation and deferred compensation that is activated at retirement. The employe agrees to accept less during his active employment in exchange for benefits during his retirement. In the instant case, the post retirement medical benefits requested by appellant are deferred compensation for the compensation forgone during active employment in exchange for benefits and security upon retirement.</p>

Rather, the opinion in support of affirmance attempts to imply such a prohibition by focusing exclusively on the word “employes” and presuming that it refers exclusively to present, active personnel. In light of the factors discussed above, the awarding of post-retirement medical benefits would not mandate a municipal government to perform an illegal act.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[256,698,1145,431]]]'>The opinion in support of affirmance cites <em>City of Washington v. Police Department of Washington, supra, </em>for holding that it was illegal for the city of Washington to pay for hospitalization for <em>families </em>of employes because the families were not employes. The case at hand does not deal with medical benefits for families; rather, it concerns medical benefits for retired employes only. The <em>City of Washington </em>case is inapposite.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[251,1162,1147,654]]]'>The power of the Board is limited to the perimeters set by the parties. Appellant proposed post retirement medical benefits until the retirees’ death; whereas, appellee counter-proposed post retirement medical benefits for a period of three years after retirement. The issue before the Board was not whether post retirement medical benefits should be given; but rather, for how long those benefits should be given (ranging from a three year minimum presented by appellee to lifetime benefits presented by appellant). Thus by awarding post retirement medical benefits for only one year, the Board was acting outside of the perimeters set by the parties. The Board again exceeded its power.</p>
