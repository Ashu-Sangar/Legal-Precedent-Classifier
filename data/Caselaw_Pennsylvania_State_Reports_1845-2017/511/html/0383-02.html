At the original closing date, the buyers had obtained a twenty-year mortgage for $57,500.00 at 10.25% interest.

Second, Appellants argue that the tendered deed was a valid offer, which refused, was a rejection of the contract, and that the buyers’ attempted acceptance of that offer was late and, hence, not binding. Finally, with regard to the Chancellor’s apportionment of damages, they assert that the use of an increase in the annual mortgage percentage rate to penalize them was inequitable.</p>

The original time for performance having passed, the court, in order to relate the performance back to it, must equalize any losses occasioned by the delay by offsetting them with money payments. In balancing the equities between the parties, however, the claimed damages must be capable of being proved with reasonable certainty, and this requirement extends to a claim for interest rates. From even a cursory review of this record, the relief that will put Appellees in the position they were before the breach is incapable of sure prediction. In 1979, the Appellees obtained financing at 10.25 percent interest. When they appeared before the Chancellor in 1982, they had not obtained financing, but relied on the then current interest rate of 15.25 percent as a measure of their damage if specific performance were or<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>dered at that time.

Such decrees do not usually take effect until sometime in the future, when all appeals are exhausted, and cannot anticipate or reflect the continual changes of interest rates. Thus, actual damages are not capable of being awarded. To prove the point, reference need only be made to this case. As the matter stands, Appellees are being overcompensated by this decree, at the expense of Appellants, who are only required to compensate Appellees for the losses actually sustained by them.</p>

The same mortgage at 15.25 per cent per annum repayable at $768.20 per month, principal and interest, would aggregate $184,368.00. This represents an increased cost of $48,852.00 over the term of the mortgage.

He then added the cost of the improvements ($14,300.00) which remain unaffected by the breach. This placed the Appellees in a position where they were only required to obtain a mortgage of $26,000.00 at 15.25 per cent interest since they had $6,400.00 in cash to apply to the purchase price. At a monthly principal and interest payment of $347.18 for twenty (20) years their payback would be $83,323.20 instead of $135,516.00 for which they had bargained. This is a savings to them of $52,192.80 over the term of the mortgage and not a loss of $48,852.00 over the term of the mortgage as found by the Chancellor. This is not only unjust enrichment.

The properties are sold, and the mortgages are paid off. The owners become more affluent and increase their principal payments. The properties are sold at sheriff sale upon default. The properties are destroyed by a catastrophe— fire, flood, tornado and the like — and insurance pays off the mortgage. Interest rates drop and the properties are refinanced thus causing a payoff of the original mortgage. Or refinancing occurs for any other reason and the original mortgage is paid off. We would look a little silly today if the Chancellor’s Decree had been fulfilled and Appellees today would be refinancing the debt at today’s rates of interest of ten to eleven per cent.
