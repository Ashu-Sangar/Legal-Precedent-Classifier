After Professor Swygert handed Appellee a copy of the posted notice, Appellee told Professor Swygert that he needed to use the books in the library and that he would return at a later date to use them.

Appellee was again asked to leave and, upon his refusal, campus security was contacted. The campus security officer, who responded to the call, requested Appellee to leave and, upon his refusal, Appellee was placed under arrest, escorted from the campus, and then released. Appellee immediately returned to the library, where he was arrested at the check out desk of the library, and was charged with defiant trespass and disorderly conduct.</p>

Title to all its buildings and lands is vested in its Board of Trustees who have the inherent power to promulgate rules and regulations for the governing and management of all its institutions, lands, buildings and facilities, and to enforce those rules reasonably.

Its property is essentially private property. <em>Mooney. </em>Temple cannot receive, hold, or use property for any other purpose than its chartered purpose — the establishment and maintenance of an educational institution. The University’s law library then, like all other facilities owned by the University, is private property maintained as part of its educational facilities for the use of its students. Persons not affiliated with the University or its School of Law have no right to enter and use University facilities, including the law library, unless the University or its Law School grants that privilege or license.</p>

We cannot conclude, then, that the law library is open to members of the public within the meaning of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(c)(2) because the law library is not a place where the public generally is invited.

Since the law library is not a place open to the public, § 3503(e)(2) cannot excuse a defiant trespasser’s acts where the privilege or license to enter has expired or been revoked.</p>
