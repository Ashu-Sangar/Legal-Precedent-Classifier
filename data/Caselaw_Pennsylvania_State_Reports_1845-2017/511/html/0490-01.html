He went there but found that he could not gain entry. He then went to the Oriental Ballroom and “jimmied” open a window with a knife and went inside.

Appellant hid under a table until the sound of the footsteps became inaudible, indicating that the person had left the area. Appellant then came out from underneath the table and decided to leave the premises when he heard the footsteps again coming through the barroom. At that point, Appellant stated that he jumped up and put his hands in the air and said, “I give up.” According to Appellant, the person then said, “You son of a bitch hippie,” and shot at Appellant, striking him on the wrist and knocking him to the floor. That person was 69-year old James Volk, the security guard at the Oriental Ballroom. According to Appellant, Mr. Volk then placed the gun on the bar and started walking towards the end of the bar. Appellant then jumped up and grabbed the gun from the bar. Mr. Volk turned around and started to run toward Appellant.</p>

Over defense objection, the court permitted the prosecution to introduce evidence of Appellant’s prior convictions on one charge of burglary and two escape charges as evidence attempting to establish that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the threat or use of violence to a person. No evidence was presented by the Commonwealth to show that these convictions involved the threat or use of violence to a person.</p>
    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[159,1123,1143,417]]]'>At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth argued that the inquiry here is whether “someone could have been seriously injured,” equating the “threat of violence” with the “potential for violence.” The trial court erroneously agreed with this argument. In our view, the language of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9) is clear as to this point. It is the “threat of” and not the “potential for” violence that brings a crime into this category.</p>

Because it was admittedly trial counsel’s strategy to advance a diminished capacity defense, it was imperative that they lay a foundation for this defense by showing Appellant’s significant history of confinement in these various mental institutions, as well as a suicide attempt. Knowing that the basis for Appellant’s stay in these institutions and the suicide attempt was his prior criminal incarcerations, the only reasonable strategy would have been to attempt to introduce this evidence with all references to the criminal acts or incarcerations eliminated. This could have been accomplished through a pre-trial motion or a motion in limine outside the hearing of the jury, where counsel could have advanced the argument that the need for this evidence was so necessary to promote Appellant’s defense, that the Commonwealth should be precluded from any cross-examination which touched on any reference to past bad acts. <em>Cf., Commonwealth v. Bighum, </em><a href="/pa/452/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="452 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="575369" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0554-01">452 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=307%20A.2d%20255" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="307 A.2d 255">307 A.2d 255</a> (1973). This was neither contemplated nor done. This alternative had a substantial likelihood for success since the Commonwealth’s need for this evidence in challenging the validity of Appellant’s stays in these institutions could have been met through other means — most directly by testimony of the treating physicians relative to whether Appellant manipulated his way into these institutions or not. It cannot be realistically said that the failure to attempt such <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>a strategy had any reasonable basis designed to effectuate their client’s interest.</p>

Such it may have been, but the Commonwealth should have been required to introduce its own evidence, <em>e.g., </em>psychiatric reports indicating no validity to the claims of mental illness, to make this case. Counsel’s <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>failure to object to this highly prejudicial exchange is inconceivable. This is certainly ineffectiveness of the most prejudicial kind; yet the majority chooses to forego any detailed analysis and concludes:</p>
    <blockquote id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[191,507,1101,692]]]'>We find that any error that existed by this course of action did not prejudice Appellant and had no effect on the judgment in this case <em>or on the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. </em>Here, Appellant testified at trial that his victim was on his knees, choking on his own blood. ... Thus, Appellant admitted that the act of killing his victim was deliberate and premeditated. The defense attempted to establish that due to Appellant’s diminished mental capacity at the time of the killing, he did not act willfully. The jury was justified in disbelieving this defense and finding that he did act willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>
    <p id="b561-6" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[146,1233,1144,1076]]]'>Maj. opinion at p. 502-503 (Emphasis added). Even conceding the overwhelming evidence of guilt, it cannot be objectively determined how this unnecessary evidence affected the minds of the jury at the penalty phase of the trial, a time when, at the very least, the evidence of mental capacity, while not negating the specific intent of the crime, could indeed have had some effect on the mitigation and penalty assessed. As Mr. Chief Justice Nix correctly points out in his dissent, Maj. opinion at p. 514, Nix, C.J., dissenting), this exchange was used as the basis of the Commonwealth’s argument for the death penalty during the penalty phase of the trial. Additionally, since the majority has found error in two of the three aggravating circumstances presented to the jury, a finding of the mitigating circumstance that “the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,” 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(2), could well have negated the imposition of the death penalty. The majority, however, in its “rush to justice” fails to give this possibility even cursory analysis. In view of the consequences, I find this unacceptable.</p>

      <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>That a defendant should suffer the statutory punishment for the heinous crime he commits will never be disputed. However, where a defendant is sentenced to suffer the ultimate penalty of death, I will never support a rule of law which allows that defendant to face his death without being provided the fairest trial, though it need not be perfect, that he may be entitled to as guaranteed by both the State and Federal Constitutions. Anything less is unacceptable. I must therefore dissent from what I perceive this Court’s direction to be-a shortcut, result-oriented practice of jurisprudence.</p>
