The CAT Fund was to be funded by levying an initial charge of $5 upon motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1762. The Act directed that this charge was to be remitted to an agent designated by the Insurance Department, who in turn would remit the charge to the Insurance Department for deposit in the trust fund. <em>Id. </em>To enforce payment the Act directed PennDOT to refuse registration, renewal, or transfer of registration of any motor vehicle to which the charge attached until there was proof that the charge had been paid. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1763.

The Department’s rationale for this procedure was to create a mechanism to match the roster of persons having purchased automobile insurance and paid the CAT Fund charge, against the roster of automobile registrants, and thereby discover both uninsured motorists and those failing to pay the CAT Fund charge. The regulations were presented to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> on August 2, 1984.

On September 6, 1984, in a 3-2 vote the IRRC again rejected the proposed regulations.

Judge Colins based the entitlement to an award of counsel fees on his finding that the attorneys’ efforts resulted in the implementation of a system for the funding of the CAT Fund.

Specifically, the plaintiffs in the consolidated actions wanted PennDOT to collect the charge as opposed to a system utilizing the insurance companies as the collection agents. It is important to note that at the time the action was commenced the fund was not even authorized to be in existence; that the Insurance Department was duly proceeding in establishing an acceptable method of collection; and that the only reason the Department’s efforts had not achieved implementation of a collection system, as of the time appellee filed her complaint, was due to the objections of the IRRC.

If anything, the court’s intervention, necessitated by appellee’s complaint, stymied the normal administrative procedures which were being pursued by the Insurance Department.

Meadville Theological School, supra. </em>In that case, an equity action was brought by dissenting trustees to restrain the majority trustees of a theological school from transferring its institution and educational activities from its Pennsylvania location to Chicago, and to restrain the transfer of its property to an Illinois corporation. The litigation resulted in a decree restraining the transfer of the assets of the school, and prohibiting the trustees from managing and directing its strictly corporate business in any other place but Meadville, Pennsylvania. This Court reversed the lower court’s award of counsel fees on the basis that the purpose and effect of the litigation was to control the managerial actions of the trustees, not to preserve the property or a fund, since the property would have been as safe in Illinois as in Pennsylvania.</p>
