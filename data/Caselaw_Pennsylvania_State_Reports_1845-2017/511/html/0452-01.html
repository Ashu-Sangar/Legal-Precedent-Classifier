The lower court arrested judgment and dismissed the charges after holding that the appellee was tried in violation of Rule 1100 of the Pa.R.Crim.Pro. which requires that criminal defendants be brought to trial within 180 days of the filing of a criminal complaint. The lower court concluded that Rule 1100 was violated even though prior to trial the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>Commonwealth, pursuant to the Rule, petitioned for and obtained an extension of time permitting the appellee’s trial to begin beyond the 180-day time requirement. The lower court ruled and the Superior Court affirmed on the lower court’s opinion, that the Commonwealth failed to act with due diligence in attempting to bring the appellee to trial, and therefore, the extension of time granted to the Commonwealth was invalid. We disagree with the conclusion that the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate due diligence and that the extension of time granted by the court was improper. We, therefore reverse.</p>

On the evening of February 12, 1982, Gill and Epps were on leave, traveling by auto from Philadelphia to Charleston, West Virginia. The automobile they were riding in was owned by Epps. At or about 10 o’clock p.m. they stopped for the night at a Best Western motel in Carlisle, Pa. After checking in, they went to their room, unpacked some of their belongings, watched television for a short time and then went to a lounge located in a lower level of the motel. In the lounge they sat at the bar and had some drinks, keeping pretty much to themselves. It was between midnight and 1:00 a.m. when they returned to their room.</p>

Both were strangers, but they were admitted to the room, supposedly to discuss the alleged harrassment of a certain woman that occurred earlier in the lounge. After talking a while the appellee said he had made a mistake as to the identity of Gill and Epps and he and the other man began to leave. Moments after they went out the door, and before the door was completely closed, the appellee and his accomplice burst violently back into the room. The appellee was wielding a wooden club and his accomplice was brandishing a handgun. The appellee, without provocation, began to viciously beat Epps with the club while his accomplice pistol whipped Gill after ordering Gill to lie on his stomach on the floor of the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>bathroom. The senseless beatings opened wounds on the victims spilling their blood about the room especially in the area where Gill was pistol whipped. The battered victims were made to wipe up the bloody mess, using the motel towels. After they cleaned up the blood as ordered, the victims were then made to put on their outer coats and leave the room. With the appellee leading the way and his cohort at the rear with pistol in hand, Gill and Epps were forced to walk into the cold winter night. The forced march took them Vs to <em>Vi </em>of a mile away from the motel into a secluded wooded area. When they reached a small stream, they were savagely attacked again. Epps was repeatedly beaten with the wooden club and Gill with the pistol. While the appellee was pummelling Epps with the club, appellee apparently noticed that Epps had a folding knife attached to his belt. Appellee took the knife and used it to stab Epps, opening wounds in his chest, back and face near his right eye. Appellee then gave the knife over to his accomplice who used it on Gill. Gill was stabbed in the chest and in the throat, directly below his adam’s apple. Unconscious and bleeding from the beatings and the knife wounds, Gill and Epps were left for dead lying in the woods. The appellee and his accomplice returned to the motel, took some of the victims’ belongings from their room, stole Epps’ automobile and left the state. Miraculously, Gill and Epps managed to get help and survived.</p>

Three days later it was learned that the appellee was in custody in Virginia on separate criminal charges. One day after that, on February 17, 1982, Pennsylvania state police officers went to Danville, Virginia and lodged a detainer against the appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Subsequently, various informal exchanges were made between the district attorney’s office and the Virginia authorities. In a letter dated April 1, 1982, the Virginia authorities notified the district attorney’s office that the appellee was awaiting trial in Danville. Further, the notice indicated that the appellee would probably be tried in Danville sometime during the month of May and the Virginia charges would be disposed of by the end of that month. On May 27, 1982, the district attorney filed the papers required under the Detainers Act seeking temporary custody of appellee for the purpose of trying him on the charges pending in Pennsylvania. In a letter dated June 21, 1982, the Virginia authorities notified the district attorney’s office that appellee’s sentencing in Virginia was continued pending the outcome of an appeal appellee had filed. Because he had not been sentenced, appellee was not a prisoner who had begun a term of <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>imprisonment and therefore, he was not, at that time, subject to the Detainers Act. The Virginia authorities further advised that at such time that the appellee entered into the Virginia penal system as a sentenced prisoner, the district attorney would be notified so that proceedings under the Detainers Act may be initiated. In July, 1982 the district attorney’s office was notified that before appellee could be returned to Pennsylvania he was entitled to a hearing in Virginia. It was indicated that this process alone would take thirty additional days. It was at this point that the Commonwealth sought and obtained an extension of time to bring the appellee to trial. The record demonstrates that the Commonwealth’s efforts to bring the appellee to trial were reasonable and were pursued with diligence. On these facts we find that the extension of time was properly granted. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Roman, </em><a href="/pa/494/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="494 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1769079" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0440-01">494 Pa. 440</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="494 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1769079" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0440-01">431 A.2d 936</a> (1981).

The District Attorney in Mercer county, Joseph J. Nelson, contacted the Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to initiate extradition proceedings on December 7, 1973. After several communications among the Deputy Secretary, Nelson, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, and appropriate New Jersey authorities, Nelson requested delivery of appellant to Pennsylvania authority pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act. After denial of said request, Nelson contacted Governor William P. Cahill of New Jersey on behalf of Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp, again requesting delivery of appellant to Pennsylvania officials. A nega-N tive response from the Governor of New Jersey was received on February 19, 1974, reiterating their position that custody of appellant would not be transferred until <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>the disposition of the charges against him. These prompt attempts by the Commonwealth to secure custody of appellant are more than enough evidence to establish due diligence by the Commonwealth. The time period in which the Commonwealth attempted to extradite appellant, December 7,1973, until July 18,1974, when the New Jersey authorities surrendered the appellant, was 223 days. When excluded from the 351 day period that ran between the filing of the complaint and the commencement of trial, it is obvious that appellant was tried well within the mandate of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(a)(1).

When the Commonwealth wants the return of a person who is facing charges and awaiting trial in another state there are two basic avenues of action that can be pursued. First, the Commonwealth may initiate extradition proceedings and hope the authorities in the asylum state will agree to return the wanted person. Except where only very minor offenses are involved, a state, ordinarily, will not surrender a prisoner until all criminal proceedings in that state are concluded. Second, the Commonwealth may wait until the criminal charges are disposed of in the other state. If those charges result in a conviction <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>and sentence, then the Commonwealth may proceed under the Detainers Act to gain temporary custody of the fugitive so that he may be tried in Pennsylvania. We are not prepared to say that the Commonwealth must always seek the return of a wanted person by initiating extradition proceedings. These matters do not arise in the abstract. In all cases there is a prosecuting attorney who must use his discretion and make decisions concerning procedures in dealing with other jurisdictions. The Commonwealth’s duty is to act reasonably, not perfectly.</p>

The appellee’s omnibus pre-trial motion included, inter alia, a motion to dismiss for failure on the part of the Commonwealth to bring the appellee to trial within 180 days of the filing of the criminal complaint against him. It also included a motion to dismiss for failure to call appellee’s case for trial during the next term of court following his return to Pennsylvania. On November 23, 1983 a hearing on appellee’s omnibus motion was held before the Honorable Dale F. Shughart, S.J. In an opinion and order of December 9, 1983, Judge Shughart denied appellee’s omnibus pre-trial motion, including the motions to dismiss.</p>

So as to avoid following the clear and unambiguous mandate of Rule 1100, the majority has seen fit to once again redraft the Rule by interpretation rather than by amendment.

The action of the Appellee is irrelevant for the blame for the discharge must be placed upon the Commonwealth, not this Court, for the ineptitude of its prosecuting officers in misapplying the law. Specifically, under the Uniform Extradition Act, the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9121 et seq., the Commonwealth may request the return of a person charged in this Commonwealth with a crime if that person is imprisoned or is being held for trial <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>in another state provided that the Commonwealth agrees to return that person as soon as the prosecution in this Commonwealth is terminated. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9126. As the authorities in Virginia correctly advised the Commonwealth in this case, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9101, is applicable only to those persons who are serving terms of imprisonment. Since the Appellee was not imprisoned, the Virginia authorities acted correctly in not complying with the Commonwealth’s request. Therefore, the delay in being brought to trial was not caused by the Appellee but by the ineptitude and incompetence of the Commonwealth in failing to pursue the Appellee under the proper statute.</p>
