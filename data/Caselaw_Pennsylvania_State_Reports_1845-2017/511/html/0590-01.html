It is undisputed that when the petition for termination of parental rights was filed, James J. was in the custody of C.Y.S. and had been in such custody since birth. During that period, Appellee never assumed any parental responsibility nor has he, at any time, offered or given support for the child. In April of 1980, he questioned his paternity, wondering whether the mother’s statements, that she had been artificially inseminated by the Duponts or Jimmy Carter, were true, and said he wanted to take a fertility test to determine if he was the father. Appellee said, on cross-examination, that he did not remember saying this; however, he did admit that he had a blood test taken to determine if he was the father of James J.</p>

During these visits, Appellee would hold James briefly on his knee, at the urging of Mr. Spengeman, and would never embrace the child or call him by name. Appellee would tease the child and make no effort to comfort him despite the child’s crying. Appellee, himself, never requested a visit with James until after he received notice of these termination proceedings and, although the frequency of Appellee’s visits has increased since then, they remain devoid of any appropriate interaction between him and the child.</p>

He further stated that he liked holding the child and that, although he was a bit awkward, he tried to do his best. Appellee expressed a desire to regain visits with the child and to work toward achieving custody. He felt that his prognosis for the future was good; things looked better for him, both professionally and emotionally. Appellee said that he had “contacted a course given by the Red Cross” which covers parental duties and the care of a young child. Appellee stated that he had cooperated with C.Y.S. and that he had requested visits with the child prior to the termination of Marie’s parental rights. He admitted that prior to this termination, he only came to visit with Marie and that he told the social worker that he did not want the child, but that Marie should have him.</p>

Although the testimony was conflicting on many points, it was the task of the Orphans’ Court to resolve the conflicting testimony presented by the witnesses. Judge Catania found the testimony of Mr. Spengeman more credible than that of Appellee. He also found that Dr. Boerner was unclear as to when Appellee’s progress began and, under cross-examination, his knowledge of Appellee was severely discredited.

In the instant case, the record clearly shows that the child was in the custody of C.Y.S. virtually from birth, approximately seventeen (17) months <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>at the time of the hearing. Appellee has never had custody of, nor provided support for, his child. He never requested a visitation with the child on his own initiative during the first year of the child’s life. In fact, he did not request visitation until after he received notice of the termination proceeding. Appellee was uncooperative and hostile to all efforts made by C.Y.S. to assist him in establishing a relationship with his child and planning for the child’s future. Appellee failed to keep appointments, refused to permit the social worker into his home, and shouted obscenities and hung up on the social worker on two occasions. His visits with the child were devoid of any appropriate interaction, and were characterized by very minimal physical contact, teasing on the part of Appellee, and crying by the child.</p>

The fact that Appellee has now expressed an interest in working toward gaining custody of the child does not satisfy the affirmative duty which is required of Appellee. “When a child has been placed in foster care, a parent has an affirmative duty to work towards the return of the child.” <em>In re: William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, 333, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a>, 1233 (1978). We think this “affirmative duty,” at minimum, requires a showing by the parent of a willingness to cooperate with the agency to obtain the rehabilitative services necessary for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities. The agency must, of course, put forth a good faith effort in making services available to the parent and, once it has done so on a continuing basis, it has discharged this obligation. The record clearly shows that C.Y.S. made efforts to counsel Appellee and to assist him in planning for the child’s future. These efforts were met with open hostility by Appellee and repeated assertions by him that he could not take care of the child and had no desire to do so. As aptly stated by Judge Catania, “[TJhe parent cannot sit back, especially in factual situations like the ones presently before the Court involving the mental incapacity of the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>parent, and expect the agency to effect a ‘cure’ for the individual and then when such ‘a cure’ is not forthcoming, blame the agency for the failure.” (Slip opinion at p. 15).</p>

Appellee testified that “he contacted a course given by the Red Cross which covers parenting.” This was apparently done after termination proceedings began, and no evidence was offered that Appellee had actually taken the course or that he ever intended to take it.</p>
