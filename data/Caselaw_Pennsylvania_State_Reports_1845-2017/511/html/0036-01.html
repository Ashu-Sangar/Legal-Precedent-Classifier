In addition to his highway duties, Officer Cobb was the Fire Marshall of Susquehanna County. As such, Officer Cobb was required to investigate any fire and determine its cause and origin. On the night in question, after the fire had been extinguished (somewhere between 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.) the local fire chief requested Officer Cobb’s assistance in determining the cause of the fire. The electricity in the house in question had been turned off all day giving rise to the suspicion of arson. Neither Officer Cobb nor the chief <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>undertook to pursue their investigation at that time because entry into the premises was blocked by residual heat and dripping water. Darkness had also fallen. They decided to glance into the residence through a doorway and then departed the scene. At 9:00 a.m. the next day, Officer Cobb returned to investigate the premises, photographs were taken and floor and carpet samples were extracted from the first floor of Appellant’s residence. Officer Cobb conducted his investigation without first obtaining a warrant.</p>

A hearing was held during which Appellant, his wife and Officer Cobb testified. In addition to the uncontroverted facts set forth above, at the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth attempted to establish that either Appellant or his wife gave Officer Cobb permission to search the residence. The suppression court found to the contrary, holding that the statement of Appellant’s wife at the scene the night of the fire, “was too confused to find that she had granted permission to enter and search the building to anybody” (R. 25). The court also found that on the day after the fire Officer Cobb had already entered Appellant’s residence without permission before Appellant appeared on the scene and offered assistance to him. The suppression court concluded that Officer Cobb’s search was constitutionally infirm and ordered the suppression of all the obtained evidence.</p>

Because of the late hour, and the remaining heat and water, Officer Cobb was held to have continued his warrantless investigation properly the next morning. Contrary to the Majority’s determination, Judge Cirillo concluded that the primary object of Officer Cobb’s warrantless search was to gather evidence of criminal activity, not to determine the cause and origin of the recent fire. Therefore, the dissent is of the view that the “exigent circumstance” exception was not applicable.</p>

New Hampshire, </em><a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">403 U.S. 443</a>, <a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">91 S.Ct. 2022</a>, <a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">29 L.Ed.2d 564</a> (1971). The United States Supreme Court has, however, carved out exceptions to the requirement of a search based upon a warrant. For example, an individual’s consent will obviate the necessity of obtaining a search warrant. <em>Katz v. United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S.Ct. 507</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">19 L.Ed.2d 576</a> (1967). Likewise, “exceptional” circumstances may exist which will require immediate action rather than seeking a prior judicial determination of probable cause. In those “exceptional” circumstances, a law enforcement agent seeking to conduct a warrantless search may do so if incident to a lawful arrest or to prevent destruction or removal of contraband. <em>Johnson v.

Under what circumstances, then, may a fire marshall not conduct an investigation without a search warrant, where consent has not been properly obtained? To answer this question, it is necessary to review in detail the two most recent United States Supreme Court cases on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[268,770,1145,1152]]]'>In <em>Tyler, </em>the United States Supreme Court attempted to resolve the issue of when a fire marshall may conduct a nonconsenting, warrantless search. While fighting a fire at the defendant’s furniture store, fire officials found two plastic containers of flammable liquid. Immediately, the fire chief examined the containers and summoned a police detective to assist in his investigation to determine the origin and cause of the fire. This investigation had to be abandoned due to the smoke and steam present in the building. By 4:00 a.m., the fire had been extinguished and the firefighters had departed. At 8:00 a.m., the same fire officials, along with the assistant fire chief who had not been there previously,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> again appeared on the scene to determine the origin and cause of the fire. After a cursory examination, the officials left and returned for a third time an hour later. During this last visit, the fire officials obtained various floor and carpeting samples. Approximately three weeks later, another police official visited the furniture store, took photographs, and conducted a more thorough search of the premises. At no time did any police or fire official obtain a search warrant or have the owner’s consent.</p>

Justice Powell points out, however, that firemen <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>fighting a fire frequently do not <em>remain </em>within a building once they enter. He points out that in many situations, entry may be too hazardous until the fire has been wholly extinguished and that even then the danger of collapsing walls may exist. Thus, the effort to ascertain the cause of a fire may extend over a period of time with entry and re-entry. He views the critical inquiry, therefore, as being whether reasonable expectations of privacy exist in the fire-damaged premises at a particular time and, if so, whether exigencies justify the re-entries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> The aftermath of a fire often presents exigencies that will not tolerate the delay necessary to obtain a warrant or to secure the owner’s consent.

Firemen have the right to enter a private residence without a warrant without violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, if done so for the purpose <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>of extinguishing a fire. While performing the task, firemen may seize any evidence, which is in plain view, of the cause and origin of the fire. In fighting the fire, fire officials are also immediately charged with determining the cause and origin of the fire. The purposes of the investigation into the cause and origin of the fire may properly include prevention of the rekindling of the fire, and prevention of the destruction of evidence, either accidentally or intentionally. When the search is conducted for one of these purposes, no search warrant is necessary, even if consent has not been granted, but only if the search is a continuation of an initial entry. If the nonconsenting, warrantless entry is begun, but must be terminated due to the condition of the building, then that search may be continued at the first instance reentry is possible. Finally, if it is clearly shown that the search is not for the purpose of determining the cause and origin of the fire, but rather to obtain evidence of criminal activity, then such search must either be with consent or with a valid search warrant.</p>

From the testimony of Officer Cobb, one can only conclude that the purpose of the search the morning after the fire was to determine its cause and origin. Officer Cobb did not enter the building to investigate the cause of the fire on the evening it occurred because he looked into the building and “saw that the place was extremely hot yet and a large amount of water was coming down through the ceiling and also it was late in the evening.” N.T. at 3. <em>There is nothing on the record before us, </em>nor even a suggestion by Appellant in his brief, that Officer Cobb, or anyone else, knew at this time what the cause or origin of the fire was. Indeed, the <em>only thing </em>that fire officials knew or had reason to believe on the evening of the fire and the next morning was that electricity was <em>not </em>the cause of the fire and that, since no other cause was <em>apparent, </em>the fire was “suspicious in nature.” N.T. at 11-13.</p>

On the basis of what Officer Cobb knew on the morning in question, it is clear that he had only a suspicion, and mere suspicions do not constitute probable cause to support a search warrant.

We conclude that like <em>Tyler, </em>and unlike <em>Clifford, </em>the re-entry here <em>was </em>a continuation of an original entry, and that it occurred at the first reasonable opportunity to do so. Essentially, Officer Cobb’s entry or re-entry was a continuation of the entry by the firefighters the evening before. Even if it could reasonably be contended that Officer Cobb was a different investigator, separate and distinct from the firemen, and that his entry the next morning was somehow not continuous with that of the firemen the night before (a contention which we reject), Appellant’s argument must nevertheless fail. While the United States Supreme Court did state in <em>Tyler </em>that “the morning entries were no more than an actual continuation of the first, and the lack of a warrant thus did not invalidate the resulting seizure of evidence,” 436 U.S. at 511, 98 S.Ct. at 1951, the constitutional importance of this finding lies not simply in the fact that an investigation once begun may continue at a later time, but in the fact that there is an exigent need to determine the cause of a fire and that if conditions prevent fire investigators from making an immediate cause determination, the investigation may be made or continue at the first reasonable opportunity to do so after dousing the flames. A fire creates an exigent need <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>to put it out, of course, and it also creates a vital need to ascertain the cause.</p>

This exigency is exactly the same whether the fire officials first start to investigate by actually entering the building and then break-off the investigation due to adverse conditions, or whether, as in the instant case, the conditions (intense heat, water and darkness) prevented specific investigators from themselves entering in the first place. In either event, the cause of the fire remains undetermined until an investigator discovers its origin. We reject the argument based on <em>Tyler </em>to the effect that Officer Cobb’s search would have been a “good search” had he but first entered the building the previous night before deciding it was too hot, wet and dark to conduct an investigation, and then left, but because he simply stood outside the building and, based on personal observation, years of experience as a fire marshall, and common sense, decided that it would be wise to return the first thing in the morning to start the investigation, that it was a “bad search.” It is obvious that such a “distinction” between this case and <em>Tyler </em>is one without difference and one which has little or no relevance to the validity of the fire investigation.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S.Ct. 507</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">19 L.Ed.2d 576</a> (1967). Likewise, “exceptional” circumstances may exist which will require immediate action rather than seeking a prior judicial determination of probable cause. In those “exceptional” circumstances, a law enforcement agent seeking to conduct a warrantless search may do so if incident to a lawful arrest or to prevent destruction or removal of contraband. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em><a href="/us/333/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="333 U.S. 10" data-case-ids="6156920" data-case-paths="/us/333/0010-01">333 U.S. 10</a>, <a href="/us/333/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="333 U.S. 10" data-case-ids="6156920" data-case-paths="/us/333/0010-01">68 S.Ct. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%20436" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="92 L.

Under what circumstances, then, may a fire marshall conduct an investigation without a valid search warrant, where consent has not been properly obtained.

While fighting the fire at the defendant’s furniture store, fire officials found two plastic containers of flammable liquid. Immediately, the fire chief examined the containers and summoned a police detective to assist in his investigation to determine the origin and cause of the fire. This investigation had to be abandoned due to the smoke and steam present in the building. By 4 a.m., the fire had been extinguished and the <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>fire fighters had departed. Four hours later, the same fire officials again appeared on the scene to determine the origin and cause of the fire. After a cursory examination, the officials left and returned for a third time an hour later. During this last visit, the fire officials obtained various floor and carpeting samples. Approximately three weeks later, another police official visited the furniture store, took photographs, and conducted a more thorough search of the premises. At no time did any police or fire official obtain a search warrant or have proper consent.</p>

The majority further held that since a burning building presents an exigent circumstance sufficient to justify a fireman’s entry into the building for the purpose of terminating the fire, any search incident thereto cannot be unreasonable. Because firefighters not only have a duty to extinguish the fire, but also have a duty to determine the cause of the fire, as a protection against reoccurrence, no search warrant or consent is necessary if any such investigation occurs promptly. The Court said:</p>

Firemen have the right to enter a private residence without a warrant without violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution if done so for the purpose of extinguishing a fire. While performing the task, firemen may seize any evidence, which is in plain view, of the cause and origin of the fire. In addition to fighting the fire, fire officials are charged with determining the cause and origin of the fire. The purpose of the investigation into the cause and origin of the fire is to prevent rekindling of the fire. When the search is conducted for this purpose, then no search warrant is necessary even if consent has not been granted, but only if the search is a continuation of the initial entry. If the nonconsenting, warrantless search into the cause and origin of the fire is begun, but must be terminated due to the condition of the building, then that search may be continued at the first instance reentry is permissible. Finally, if it is clearly shown that the search is not for the purpose of determining the cause and origin of the fire, but rather to obtain evidence of criminal activity, then such search must either be with consent or with a valid search warrant.</p>
