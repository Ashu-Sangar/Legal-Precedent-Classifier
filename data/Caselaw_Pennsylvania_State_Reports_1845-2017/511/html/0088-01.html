      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>The NGPA dictated that certain large industrial consumers, specifically those who used natural gas as a boiler fuel, were to pay surcharges to utility companies in each state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> These companies would, in turn, pay “upstream” to interstate pipelines. Once received by the pipelines, the revenues would be used to reduce the rates of eligible consumers in the states served by the pipeline (including Pennsylvania). Eligible consumers included all consumers except those who use the natural gas as boiler fuel, but even the latter would be entitled to a rate reduction to the extent that they consumed gas in non-boiler uses. Thus, the surcharge imposed by the NGPA entitled eligible Pennsylvania consumers to share in the pipeline’s rate reductions for the entire nation.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[153,1087,1143,584]]]'>On December 7, 1979, in response to the NGPA, the Pennsylvania PUC (appellee) ordered jurisdictional utility companies to file a tariff, known as the Boiler Fuel Rider (hereinafter “BFR”) surcharge, upon industrial consumers with “non-exempt” status as established by the aforementioned NGPA federal standards. This surcharge was set at the exact amount necessary to eliminate any gap between the base industrial gas rate and the maximum rate allowed under the federal program. The result was that it was impossible to implement the federal surcharge without exceeding the federally prescribed maximum rate.</p>

Consequently, each company was ordered under the 1979 decree to place all additional monies, resulting from the BFR surcharge, in an interest bearing escrow account. The account is presently in excess of $15 million.</p>

On February 27, 1981, a decision was entered recommending certain minor alterations in the manner of collecting the BFR surcharge, along with a proposal for the distribution of the fund. A refund to eligible consumers through calculations based on the Gas Cost Rate was found to be most closely in conformance with the federal plan, and within the scope of the Public Utility Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Furthermore, this “flow-back” method of distribution was found to result in the utility companies collecting an amount from the consumers equal to their revenue requirements.</p>

In the opinion, the PUC reasoned that since the NGPA is not the sole authority for the institution of the BFR rider, it cannot be the controlling factor in determining how any excess revenues granted by the BFR surcharge are to be disposed of. Instead, the PUC decided to establish three (3) programs aimed at the long-term effect of conservation, finding that the legislature had conferred upon it a duty to promote energy conservation with the enactment of § 308(c) of the Public Utility Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

In affirming the PUC’s order, the Commonwealth Court acknowledged that § 308(c), governing the PUC’s authority in conservation matters, is insufficient to create, without more, the power to establish and dispose of a fund similar to the one challenged at bar. Nevertheless, despite this lack of authority, the court found the creation of the BFR surcharge fund to be legitimate because it did not result from the PUC’s direct action, but rather from an “unforeseen development in governing federal authority.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=480%20A.2d%201273" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="480 A.2d 1273">Id.,</a> </em>84 Pa.Cmwlth. at 88, <a href="/citations/?q=480%20A.2d%201273" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="480 A.2d 1273">480 A.2d at 1280</a>.

The PUC contends the fund was a result of the federal act; whereas the PGCG maintains the fund was created by a direct order on behalf of the PUC.

It does not empower the PUC to create funds, or to mandate programs to utilize those funds. Nor can the PUC rely on the federal law in support of its decision to enact these programs, since the NGPA specifically provided for the disposition of funds created from the surcharge by reducing the rates of eligible customers.
