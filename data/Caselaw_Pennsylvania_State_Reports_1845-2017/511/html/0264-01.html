    <p id="b308-10" data-blocks='[["BL_308.8",308,[258,992,1145,682]]]'>The facts of this case are as follows: Appellant, Joseph Cugini, was laid off from his position at Mesta Machine Company (Mesta) on July 2, 1982. Shortly thereafter, he filed an application for unemployment compensation benefits, which was granted. In July, 1983, he attempted to open a claim for a second year of benefits. At that time, the local unemployment compensation office ruled that Appellant did not satisfy the financial eligibility criteria. Appellant appealed and a hearing was held before a Referee. The Referee determined that Appellant did not have sufficient wages in his base year<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and ruled, therefore, that he was ineligible. Appellant then appealed to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board).</p>
    <p id="b308-11" data-blocks='[["BL_308.9",308,[256,1694,1143,256]]]'>The Board found that Appellant received the following quarterly wages in his base year: second quarter, 1982— $5,072.00; third quarter, 1982 — $2,612.00; fourth quarter, 1982 — $0; and first quarter, 1983 — $0. Total base year wages were $7,684.00. (Board Decision, Finding of Fact 2).</p>

    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[164,588,1143,364]]]'>Section 404(a)(3) of the Law provides that a claimant who has insufficient wages to qualify under Section 404(e) may still qualify for benefits if his base year wages qualify him for any one of the next three benefit rates. Of the next three benefit rates, $202.00 is the lowest, but requires total base year wages of at least $8,000.00. Consequently, Appellant also failed to qualify under Section 404(a)(3).</p>

At the Board hearing, Appellant presented uncontroverted testimony that on December 26, 1982, he applied for eight weeks of severance pay, amounting to $3,652.40 (N.T., p. 3). Under normal employer practice, this amount would have been given to him on January 10, 1983 (N.T., p. 3). Because of a work overload in its accounting department, the employer (Mesta) advised Appellant’s union that actual payment would be delayed until February 13, 1983 (N.T., pp. 3-4). However, on February 9, 1983, Mesta filed for bankruptcy (N.T., pp. 3-4). The bankruptcy proceeding further delayed payment, although Appellant eventually received the full amount of the severance pay in August, 1984. (See Stipulation of Counsel and Order of Commonwealth Court dated October 9, 1984).</p>

If the Board had credited this amount to the first quarter of 1983, Appellant’s base year earnings would have <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>exceeded $8,000.00, and he would have been eligible for the unemployment compensation benefits at issue.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[247,405,1142,360]]]'>The Board concluded that wages must be credited to the quarter in which the date occurs on which such wages are actually paid. Since Section 4(x) of the Act defines “wages” as “remuneration paid,” 43 P.S. § 753(x), the Board’s decision construes the Act literally, such that a claimant must actually receive possession of the money or payment due before it can be counted in his base year.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[248,781,1140,255]]]'>Here, the employer acknowledged that the severance pay was due on January 10, 1983.

In support of its decision, Commonwealth Court cited <em>Wooley v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/71/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="71 Pa.

Under the Act, the Unemployment Compensation Department is authorized to administer and enforce the Act and is given power and authority to adopt rules and regulations pursuant thereto.

Such remedial <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>legislation must always be interpreted so that the benefit sections are liberally and broadly construed to alleviate the distress of the involuntarily unemployed. More recently, in <em>Lopata v. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa/507/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="507 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1792360" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0570-01">507 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="507 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1792360" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0570-01">493 A.2d 657</a> (1985), we restated the proposition that unless the provisions of the law unmistakeably compel the conclusion that benefits are to be denied, a remedy is to be found consonant with the purposes of the law, i.e., the granting of compensation.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[155,807,1148,630]]]'>As Appellant’s brief points out, the regulation which Appellant seeks to apply is also congruent with federal law. There are no provisions in FUTA or the Social Security Act which preclude Pennsylvania from allocating severance pay to the quarters in which it is paid or generally paid for purposes of calculating base year wages. A state is free to design its unemployment compensation law and establish its own eligibility requirements so long as it does not conflict with the federal statutes. <em>Novak v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/73/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="73 Pa. Commw. 148" data-case-ids="1939815" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/73/0148-01">73 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 148</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=457%20A.2d%20610" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="457 A.2d 610">457 A.2d 610</a> (1983). On this last point, the Commonwealth apparently does not disagree.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[156,1457,1144,365]]]'>Under the circumstances, we would ordinarily remand this case to Commonwealth Court for further proceedings. In this case, however, application of the relevant regulation is so simple and straightforward that a remand directly to the Unemployment Compensation Board for the purpose of reversing the Referee and awarding benefits to Appellant would be more sensible and expeditious.</p>

(1937) 2897, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 753(x) (Supp.1986), defines wages as “all remuneration ... paid by an employer to an individual with respect to his employment____” The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review has promulgated an interpretive regulation which provides in pertinent part:</p>

So allocating the severance pay to the quarter within which it would have been normally paid brings appellant within the financial eligibility criteria of the act. This result is fully consistent with the language of Section 4(x) of the statute, the regulation interpreting it and the policy criteria for financial eligibility, that only those who demonstrate an attachment to the work force should receive unemployment compensation benefits.</p>
