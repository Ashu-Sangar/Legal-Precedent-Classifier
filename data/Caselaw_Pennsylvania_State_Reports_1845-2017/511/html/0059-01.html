The basis of the action of Superior Court was that Appellee had not been provided a preliminary hearing.</p>
    <p id="b103-10" data-blocks='[["BL_103.8",103,[169,1175,1141,516]]]'>The facts of the case are as follows: During the early morning hours of May 20, 1979, Appellee entered Valle’s Steakhouse in Springfield Township, Delaware County. Appellee had been dating one of the restaurant’s employees, Cindy Contina, for several months and had been in the restaurant three to four times a week over that period to meet her at closing time. Appellee was, therefore, well known to the restaurant’s staff and, on occasion, had long conversations with the restaurant manager, Frederick Holder.</p>
    <p id="b103-11" data-blocks='[["BL_103.9",103,[170,1717,1139,623]],["BL_104.1",104,[260,315,1137,94]]]'>On this particular occasion, Appellee inquired concerning Cindy Contina and was advised that she had already departed. Appellee then left the office and, Mr. Holder presumed, left the restaurant. A few minutes later, while the manager was still on the phone, Appellee reappeared and invited Mr. Holder to accompany him for a drink. Mr. Holder declined, indicating he had an early morning the following day. Appellee left and re-entered the office a third time, about four minutes later. The manager was no longer telephoning and was told by Appellee: “Fred, you’ve been set up, I’m holding you up.” Appellee had come armed with a French chef’s knife with a blade some ten to twelve <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>inches long. As Mr. Holder started to object, Appellee slashed his right arm.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[257,427,1141,459]]]'>The manager, now fearing for his life and with Appellee holding the knife against his chest, opened the restaurant safe, which contained Saturday’s and Sunday’s receipts approximating $20,000.00. Appellee took the money and Mr. Holder’s wristwatch. During this incident, Appellee held the knife to Mr. Holder’s neck and told him that if the robbery was reported, Appellee would kill him, his fiance, and Cindy Contina. Appellee then exited the restaurant. Mr. Holder called the police and was taken to the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[256,904,1139,399]]]'>Appellee fled the jurisdiction, first to Atlantic City, New Jersey, and then to the southern United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified, and a Federal Flight to Avoid Prosecution Warrant was issued for Appellee’s arrest. Almost two years later, on February 6, 1981, Appellee was arrested in the State of Georgia, and ultimately was returned to Pennsylvania to face charges stemming from this incident.</p>

I cannot join the majority opinion, however, because I view it as implying that the lack of a preliminary hearing may be “cured” by later proceedings. Our rules allow the Commonwealth to avoid a preliminary hearing upon a showing of good cause. Without this showing, I do not believe that a hearing on pre-trial motions adequately protects a defendant’s right to be free of unlawful detention, unless a judicial officer holds a preliminary hearing and finds probable cause. At that preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth has the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case against the defendant. A hearing, some months later, on pre-trial motions may be a poor cure for its omission.</p>
