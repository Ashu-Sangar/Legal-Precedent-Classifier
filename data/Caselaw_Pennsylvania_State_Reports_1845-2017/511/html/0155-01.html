Appellant was sentenced to consecutive terms of ten (10) to twenty (20) years for each count of robbery. Post trial motions were denied and appellant’s conviction was subsequently affirmed by the Superior Court, <a href="/citations/?q=337%20Pa.%20Super.%20627" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="337 Pa.

This Court granted allocatur to specifically address appellant’s contention that the identification procedures utilized by the Commonwealth were prejudicial to the point of warranting a new trial. We disagree and therefore affirm based on the reasons set out below.</p>
    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[172,990,1145,845]]]'>The robberies in question were committed on the night of March 4, 1982, within approximately one and one-half (IV2) hours of one another. The trial court found that the respective victims, numbering three (3) altogether, had ample time in a well-lit area to view the perpetrator’s face. The clerk-victims described the offender as being a black male, approximately five foot, ten inches (5'10") tall, wearing a black leather coat, having a “Fu Man Chu” mustache, having a unique hairstyle (a “gerry curl”) and having a dark complexion. On the basis of these descriptions, the police conducted an investigation and composed two (2) separate photo arrays, consisting of ten (10) and eleven (11) photos respectively. The arrays were shown to the victims several days after the robberies and all three (3) witnesses selected a photograph depicting appellant as the perpetrator of the robberies.</p>

The pictures, which included appellant, showed front and side views of each man. Cardboard folder frames were placed around each photo to obscure the police identification numbers hanging from each man’s neck, but the chains upon which the identification placards hung still remained visible. The second photo array was not shown to the jury, although testimonial <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>references were made to it.

    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[257,769,1145,791]]]'>Appellant contends that the photo arrays utilized by the police were of such a suggestive nature that they created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Furthermore, appellant maintains that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to see the one photo array because the quality of the photos was that of a “mugshot”, permitting the jury to infer that appellant had a prior criminal history. The Commonwealth counters that the identification process utilized by the police was proper and permissible since the photographs employed in the array bore a substantial similarity to the appellant; the witnesses had an opportunity to view appellant for a substantial amount of time under adequate lighting conditions; and finally, the photographs were not prejudicial merely because they depicted appellant in front and side profiles.</p>
    <p id="b200-7" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[255,1586,1144,577]]]'>The trial court found that the photographic array was “assembled in a manner to present the viewer with an objective selection of similar choices.” It also stated that there was no evidence that the photographs were presented by the authorities to the witnesses in an improper fashion. As to appellant’s allegation of error concerning the jury’s viewing of the photographs, the trial court held that there was no error in the jury viewing photographs from which witnesses selected an individual as the perpetrator of a crime where the array was entirely devoid of any reference to a prior criminal record.</p>

When the initial identification is challenged at trial and their reliability and fairness put to question, they become evidence subject to examination by the jury. At that time it is difficult, if not impossible, consistent with the truth, to shield the fact that a defendant’s picture was obviously on file prior to his identification. Even when the file photos are not challenged and the photos are not shown to the jury, but somehow they have been alluded to during the course of the trial, it is a small deduction to conclude that for some reason the defendant had prior police contact of some kind. However, as we emphasized above, prior contact with the police in itself proves nothing. It does not prove a prior record or previous crime, it only proves a previous contact.</p>

This may sound but superficial verbiage, mere words that accepts an ineradicable prejudice, under a cool, impractical logic. There is, of course, no fault in the logic and there is no reason for us to believe that a jury will not accept that logic and indeed that fact. If we accept that a jury will not follow the law and the logic of this occasion, a logic so obvious, so clear, so much a part of common experience, how can we believe that they ever do.</p>

We are satisfied that irrelevant prejudicial answers by a witness can be obviated by a charge of the court. Given that police photo files are an absolute necessity for the detection of crime, we must accept that where used, the jury can be instructed and will respond to a definitive charge by the court that possession by the police of one’s picture, of itself, proves no accusation, is irrelevant to any consideration before them, and is not inconsistent with innocence.</p>

Previous conviction is not now, as heretofore, an argument that may be used to bolster an accusation.

Where used in evidence the court shall charge the jury, when requested by a defendant, that because one’s photo is in the possession of the police does not prove a previous conviction, and suggests no more than that there was a previous police contact, the reason for which, is not known <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>and has no bearing on the issues before them.

This is so notwithstanding the fact that, as the Commonwealth has pointed out, there were not present in this case testimonial references to the photos which identified the photos as having come from police department files. The Commonwealth claims that the lack of such testimonial references makes it likely that the jury believed the photos came from a neutral source. However, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from three of the robbery victims that appellant’s picture was identified from photo arrays arranged by police, and, although the victims testified that the photos were shown to them at their places of employment rather than at a police station, the nature of the photographs is such as to indicate that the photos did not come from a neutral source.</p>

Cardboard folder frames were attached to the photos to obscure from the jury’s view the police identification numbers on the photos. An examination of the photographs reveals that the jury could not help but have concluded that the photo array was composed of “mug shots.” Indeed, all of the photos are <em>identical </em>in format, the format being one traditionally associated with “mug shots.” The photographic lighting, background, pose, and print size does not vary from one photo to another. Despite the fact that police identification numbers have been obscured by cardboard frames, the nature of what is being concealed by the frames is immediately apparent. In all of the photos, including appellant’s, there is visible a chain around the neck of the individual photographed. The chains are positioned in a manner that would be expected to support a sign displaying a police identifica<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>tion number, and, in fact, in some of the photos in the array there is visible the top edge of a sign attached to the chain. The sign is not visible in the photo of appellant, but the chain is, and the inference to be made is clear. In one of the photos in the array it is even possible to discern the word “POLICE” on the top edge of the sign. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The rudimentary tape cover placed over the prison numbers on the photograph, and over the notations on the reverse side, neither disguised the nature of the picture nor avoided the prejudice.
