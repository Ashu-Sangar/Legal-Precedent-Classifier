Because we believe the Board has the power to attempt to reconcile the inconsistent results on the record in these cases by directing impartial testimony and assigning all of the cases to a single referee, we reverse Commonwealth Court. With respect to Kay, Resuta and Pesta, we note that a denial of the Board’s remand power on these facts requires a reinstatement of the decision against the parties with the burden of proof, denying them benefits entered by the referee who first heard their case. A denial of Board power to remand would leave us with an award of benefits to Croll and an inconsistent denial to Kay, Resuta and Pesta, which can sometimes result from the differing ways individual factfinders view evidence, <em>see Universal Cyclops, Inc. v.

This remand gave Kay, Resuta and Pesta a second opportunity to attempt to prove the existence of a silica hazard; it gave Croll an opportunity to clear up a possible defect in the findings awarding him <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Dorr-Oliver also received an opportunity to get a consistent decision on whether there was a silica hazard at its plant.

In this case, the Board’s power to consolidate the cases exists because of the identical nature of the evidence relating to the existence of a silica hazard in appellant’s workplace and because the claimants worked there at approximately the same time. The Board, after this consolidation, noted that while one referée believed the expert who stated that there was a silica hazard, the other referee believed the other expert who said that there was no such hazard. The Board was not attempting to review the credibility of the expert witnesses; rather, it was trying to resolve an inconsistency as to whether a silica hazard did in fact exist.</p>

Its remand was not based on this misconception but on the inconsistent results. The Board’s mistaken review of Referee Rapkin’s findings was <em>de novo </em>under the standards for review in the Disease Act. The appropriate standard governing review of a denial of benefits in compensation cases, however, is whether there was an arbitrary or capricious disregard of competent evidence, a standard less beneficial to these claimants than the <em>de novo </em>review the Board incorrectly exercised. It is evident, therefore, that had the Board exercised its proper limited review it would have affirmed the decision of the referee. Thus, there is no purpose in sending this case to the Board for a third time because it has already reviewed the record in more detail than necessary. It is on similar reasoning that appellees Kay, Pesta and Resuta’s argument that they were denied the <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>benefit of the Section 301(e), 77 P.S. § 413, presumption that their disease arose out of their employment need not be addressed further. The referee took this presumption into account in each of the four claims before him:</p>
      <blockquote id="A0U" data-blocks='[["BL_129.2",129,[216,1871,1075,310]]]'>When a claimant testifies that he was exposed to a silica hazard or when a claimant shows that he was employed in an occupation or industry in which there exists a silica hazard, great weight must be accorded to that testimony, and the burden that a defendant bears in overcoming that testimony is a large one. In the case at bar, the defendant has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the claimant’s evidence regarding a silica hazard at Dorr-Oliver is not credible and cannot be accepted.</blockquote>

Under Section 423 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 854, “... the board may disregard the findings of fact of the referee if not supported by competent evidence <em>and if it deem proper may hear other evidence, </em>....” (emphasis added). Since the Board may hear “other evidence”, it logically follows that the Board may appoint an impartial expert to give evidence regarding a relevant issue. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, I see no error in the action of the Board in remanding the matter to a new referee and appointing an impartial expert.</p>
