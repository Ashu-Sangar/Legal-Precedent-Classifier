    <p id="b627-9" data-blocks='[["BL_627.8",627,[128,797,1144,679]]]'>This is a petition for review of an order of the Commonwealth Court denying enforcement of a Pennsylvania Crime Commission subpoena. 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a); Pa.R.A.P. 3331(a)(5). The Commission argues that the court erred in addressing the Respondent’s relevancy objection as a basis for Respondent’s refusal to answer the call of the subpoena. Assuming that this objection was not premature, however, the Commission argues that the court erred in the way it applied the law to the established facts. According to the Commission, if the evidence is correctly assessed according to the proper standard of relevance, the court’s holding is against the weight of the evidence and an abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b627-10" data-blocks='[["BL_627.9",627,[128,1504,1143,685]]]'>As there is no dispute regarding the facts, they will be only briefly summarized. The Pennsylvania Crime Commission has undertaken several investigations into the practices of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, apparently in response to the Board’s decisions not to recommend disciplinary action in certain cases. In connection with one of these investigations, the Commission determined that the Board had reviewed and dismissed charges of judicial misconduct arising out of the election campaign of Judge Anthony Semeraro, Respondent. A subpoena was served on Judge Semeraro, whose refusal to comply sparked the enforcement proceedings below. The court’s refusal to enforce the subpoena generated this review.</p>
    <p id="b627-11" data-blocks='[["BL_627.10",627,[129,2219,1142,99]],["BL_628.1",628,[261,284,1146,1486]]]'>The Commission’s initial argument is that the Respondent’s objections to the subpoena are not ripe for <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>judicial review, that objections to the relevancy of subpoenaed evidence must be asserted in response to particular questions when the witness appears. This argument may be dismissed out of hand. Ordinarily, a preliminary challenge to a subpoena will be dismissed and the witness ordered to appear, interposing objections to questions as they are propounded. This is so, however, not because any prior review of the subpoena is improper, but because in the ordinary case the subpoena will bear up under the minimal scrutiny to which it is subjected in an enforcement proceeding. We need not explain in detail the reasons for granting substantial deference to administrative agencies as to the enforcement of subpoenas issued in furtherance of their investigative function. These have been thoroughly set out in <em>Pennsylvania Crime Commission v. Nacrelli, </em>5 Pa.Cmwlth. 551 (1972) and the cases cited therein, particularly <em>United States v.

It has been previously stated that “[w]hether a subpoena shall be enforced rests in the judicial discretion of the court.” <em>Pennsylvania Crime Commission v. Nacrelli, </em>5 Pa.Cmwlth at 577 <em>Cf., Robert Hawthorne, Inc. v.

We will not disturb a discretionary ruling of a lower court unless the record demonstrates an abuse of the court’s discretion.

Booth, the only witness to appear at the enforcement hearing, the Commission was investigating the Board’s practices in regard to cases where disciplinary action was not pursued after preliminary investigation. In the case of Anthony Semeraro, allegations of election law violations arising out of his judicial campaign had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. No prosecution was deemed to be warranted, and the matter was referred to the District Attorney for Delaware County, who also decided there was not basis for prosecution. These same allegations were brought to the attention of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board which apparently decided after preliminary investigation not to conduct formal hearings or pursue disciplinary action. The Commission investigation of possible public corruption in this decision of the Board was based solely on an unnamed informant’s<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> “tip” that <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>there was a connection between the Board’s vote, said to be 4-3, an unfulfilled informal agreement allegedly struck between Judge Semeraro and the Delaware County District Attorney to have Semeraro testify in an unrelated criminal case, and the supposed belief of the amorphous “political structure” of Delaware County that they could influence the Board’s decision.</p>

A detached overview of the testimony fails to dispel the impression that the Commission’s claim of relevance between the testimony sought and the purpose of the investigation — the Board’s decision-making practices — was manufactured out of whole cloth.
