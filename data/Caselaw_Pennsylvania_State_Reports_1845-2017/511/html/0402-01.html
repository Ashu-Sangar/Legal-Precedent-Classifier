This question is one of first impression before this Court requiring interpretation of the Comparative Negligence Statute. The Superior Court, in affirming the lower court, held that “[T]he Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7102, will bar recovery by a plaintiff only when his causal negligence is greater than that of the combined or aggregate negligence of all the defendants guilty of causal negligence in connection with plaintiffs injuries.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We agree, and therefore we affirm.</p>

The mishap took place on Route 8, a short distance from the Borough of Harrisville, appellant in this case. George R.H. Elder, appellee, was operating his vehicle in a southerly direction on Route 8, proceeding toward Harrisville. At that time the appellant Harrisville was in the process of staging a Memorial Day parade. Because of the planned parade route, a portion of Route 8 was blocked. This caused a line of <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>traffic to back up on Route 8, which at that point was a hill leading into Harrisville. As the appellee approached the stopped line of vehicles, he had already slowed down and was travelling at approximately 10 miles per hour. Appellee was braking his vehicle and bringing it to a stop when he was “rear-ended” by an automobile operated by original defendant Adam Orluck.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As a result of the accident, appellee Elder sustained serious injuries to his person for which he brought suit. The defendant below, Adam Orluck, joined the appellant Harrisville as an additional defendant on the theory that appellant was negligent in failing to warn oncoming traffic of the parade; in failing to direct traffic at the site; in failing to detour traffic around the parade site; in causing a dangerous condition; and in otherwise failing to exercise due care. After trial the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee Elder. The jury apportioned fault as follows: 25% to appellee Elder; 60% to original defendant Orluck; and, 15% to appellant Harris-ville. The appellant filed a motion for judgment N.O.V. and/or a new trial arguing, inter alia, that appellee cannot recover from appellant because appellee was found to be more negligent than appellant. Appellant Harrisville’s motion for judgment N.O.V. and/or a new trial was denied and judgment was entered on the verdict against both Orluck and appellant Harrisville. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed.</p>

Since appellee’s negligence exceeds that of appellant, it is asserted that recovery should be and is barred.

To say that the use of the plural “defendants” is simply legislative recognition that lawsuits are often brought against more than one defendant is to ignore that construction guide.

The appellant contends that Section (b) refers to a situation exactly as exists here, namely, where the plaintiff’s negligence exceeds the negligence of a defendant. From this premise the appellant concludes that recovery by a plaintiff against a “lesser negligent” defendant is <em>not </em>allowed. Appellant maintains that a “lesser <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>negligent” defendant is a defendant against whom the plaintiff is barred from recovering.

The language <em>“recovery from any defendant against whom the plaintiff is not barred from recovery” </em>is reasonably interpreted to exclude recovery from defendants who have settled with plaintiff prior to verdict or who are otherwise immune from liability even if causally negligent. The appellant acknowledges that the phrases <em>“all defendants against whom recovery is allowed” </em>and, <em>“against whom the plaintiff is not barred from recovery </em>” would include a negligent defendant who is immune from liability. Appellant argues though that it is unlikely that the legislature would use such broad language to describe a narrow class of tort immune defendants.

The Wisconsin statute has been interpreted by the Wisconsin courts to provide for comparing the plaintiff’s negligence to the negligence of each defendant individually and the plaintiff may not recover from any defendant who is less negligent. The appellant asserts that since the Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Law is based upon Wisconsin’s statute and, since there is a lack of case law in Pennsylvania, we are to be guided by the Wisconsin courts’ interpretation of the Wisconsin Act. The appellant bases its argument on remarks made by State Senator Henry Hager<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> to the Pennsylvania Senate and certain remarks made by State Senator Jubelier<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> at the same legislative session. We believe the <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>appellant’s reliance upon the remarks of Senators Hager and Jubelier is inappropriate. First, the legislative history of a statute is only to be considered when the Act is ambiguous or unclear. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b) &amp; (c). The Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Statute does not fall within that category. The language of the Act is straightforward, unambiguous and clear. Resort, therefore, to the legislative history of the statute is not warranted. Further, as the briefs of the appellee and of the amicus curiae<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> point out, the appellant takes the comments of the Senators out of context. The remarks of Senators Hager and Jubelier were offered in response to a proposed amendment which would have changed the thrust of the statute. The proposal would have converted the Act from a “not greater than 50%” statute to a “less than 50%” law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The Pennsylvania statute resembles the Wisconsin Act in the particular respect that both are “not greater than 50%” statutes.

Modern notions of fault and liability impelled the Legislature to cast aside the stern common law rule in favor of comparative negligence principles. The comparative doctrine adopted by the legislature provides a more reasonable approach to issues of liability and insures that an injured plaintiff will recover against a negligent defendant or defendants even though plaintiffs negligence contributed to the accident in an equal or lesser way. The injured victim’s recovery is reduced to the extent of his negligence. Comparison of the plaintiff’s negligence to that of the combined negligence of all defendants is consistent with and furthers the intent of the Act. It insures that an injured plaintiff, who is otherwise entitled to a recovery, will not go uncompensated because of the number of defendants who contributed to his injuries.</p>

This should be true no matter how the 75% negligence was apportioned among the defendants. Under the approach urged by the appellant, the manner of apportionment among the five defendants would be critical to plaintiffs recovery. For example, if five defendants were each held to be 15% negligent, the plaintiff would be barred from any recovery. This kind of inequitable result, which would leave a 25% negligent plaintiff uncompensated, was hardly intended by the Legislature. Additionally, the “individual comparison” approach would have the effect of discouraging settlements where there are multiple defendants. In cases where there is arguably some evidence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, defendants would be encouraged to add additional defendants, go to trial and attempt to have assigned a lower percentage of negligence in comparison to that assigned to the plaintiff (and other defendants) thereby escaping all liability even though causally contributing to plaintiff’s injuries.</p>

Any defendant who is so compelled to pay more than his percentage share may seek contribution”. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7102. If the phrase “against whom the plaintiff is not barred from recovery” is construed to exclude from recovery defendants who are less negligent than the plaintiff as appellant argues, a more negligent defendant who paid the entire verdict would be barred from seeking contribution from a defendant who was less negligent than the plaintiff. This is contrary to the clear intention of the Act which provides for contribu<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>tion among defendants based upon each’s proportionate share of the casual negligence contributing to the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>

The intent of the legislature was to remedy those situations where an injured plaintiff would go uncompensated because of the rigid “contributory negligence” doctrine. The Act adopts the notion that injured victims will obtain a recovery in all cases where the victim’s negligence contributing to the injuries is not greater than that of the defendant or defendants. The policy purposes of the Act are met by comparing the plaintiff’s negligence to the combined negligence of all defendants. We hold, therefore, that under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Act, recovery by an injured plaintiff will be precluded only where plaintiff’s negligence exceeds the combined negligence of all defendants. Further, each such defendant is liable for the plaintiff’s damages in proportion to his degree of negligence even if the portion of negligence attributable to a particular defendant is less than the negligence of the plaintiff.</p>

Such is not the case. The purpose of the law should be and is to achieve equality and fairness irrespective of whether a party is a plaintiff or a defendant. Further, it could well be argued that it is inequitable to require a defendant who, individually, is less negligent than the plaintiff to pay the entire amount of the allowed recovery where the more negligent tortfeasor is unable to pay his proportionate share. Indeed, to this writer such a result appears most inequitable, and, in fact, more “harsh” than what Mr. Justice Larsen has termed the “harsh common law doctrine” of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[243,1021,1146,811]]]'>Nevertheless, the language employed by the legislature clearly contemplates defendants being made to pay more than their proportionate shares, with the burden being upon them to recover from co-defendants for such excess payments. The relevant statute provides: “The plaintiff may recover the full amount of the allowed recovery from any defendant against whom the plaintiff is not barred from recovery. Any defendant who is so compelled to pay more than his percentage share may seek contribution.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7102(b). Given such language in the statute, I am constrained to concur in the result. It is not for this Court, but rather for the legislature, to re-examine this language if unfortunate results such as this are to be avoided in the future. Until it does, alas, there will be few Memorial Day parades sponsored by communities such as Harrisville.</p>

At 411. The substantial arguments made on both sides in this case alone belie this claim. Notwithstanding the need for ascertaining <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>the statute’s meaning which thus arises, I am not persuaded of the necessity or usefulness of examining the comparative negligence statutes of numerous other jurisdictions. As has been noted, “no state has a comparative negligence statute identical to that of Pennsylvania.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%20759" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="291 A.2d 759">Id.,</a> </em>At 412-413, n. 11. Finally, I question the validity of many of the examples of what would follow if the appellant’s argument were accepted. I find them to be simply straw men whose confutation adds nothing to the strength of the rationale. For these reasons I join only in the interpretation of the Comparative Negligence Act, holding that a plaintiff is precluded from recovery only where his negligence exceeds the combined negligence of all defendants, and that each such defendant is liable for the plaintiff’s damages in proportion to his degree of negligence, even if his portion of the total negligence is less than that of the plaintiff.</p>

The unfairness apparent in situations such as this derives from the rule of joint and several liability contained in the statute, placing the burden of rectifying the inequity on one defendant by seeking contribution from co-defendants. The legislature authorized this distribution of the inequities and may modify it if it so chooses.</p>
