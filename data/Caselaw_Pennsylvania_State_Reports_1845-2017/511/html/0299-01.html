The Commonwealth offered the following evidence inculpating the appellant. Appellant was a former employee of the gas station and last worked there in October of 1981. Known for that reason to all the employees, he appeared at the station on November 29, 1981. While appellant was there, an employee, Ronald Presbery, made a phone call to an off-duty employee, Maurice Rogers. During the course of the conversation Presbery told Rogers that the station manager, John Smith, and the appellant, with whom Rogers was familiar, were in the back office testing a gun. Presbery said he had heard a shot. He told Rogers that appellant was locking the door to the station, and asked Rogers whether appellant was supposed to have a key to the station.</p>

Presbery came to their car and told them that appellant, who was in the cashier’s booth, had a gun and the combination to the safe. They directed their attention to the cashier’s booth and saw appellant who they knew from before as an employee. Trader and Sears left the station, <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>and went to a movie. However, sometime past 4:15 p.m., they returned to the station, and found appellant in the cashier's booth. Appellant told them that Presbery had left with some people in a car and that if they were to see him tell him “Greg” said hurry back. Mr. Trader was not to see Presbery until later that day when the police found his dead body in the cashier’s booth, riddled with fifteen bullet wounds. It was determined that Presbery died a few hours before his body was found.</p>

Appellant told Ms. Diggins that he was going to run into some money on Sunday, the day of the murders. Sunday evening appellant came to Ms. Diggins’ house and asked if they could go somewhere private. She and appellant went to her bedroom where appellant asked her to open envelopes containing money. The envelopes were those used to hold money in the safe at the station. She gave him a black velvet bag in which he placed a large sum of cash he had with him and the money from the envelopes Ms. Diggins had opened. The bag was later recovered from appellant’s apartment with $500 cash inside. At the time Ms. Diggins saw him appellant had two guns; he took one with him and left the other, a .32 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, with Ms. Diggins. This latter gun was later determined by a ballistics expert to be the weapon used to murder both Smith and Presbery. Appellant had also given Ms. Diggins bullet shells to throw away. When she inquired about the shells, he replied, “it took that many to do the job.” Some of the shells were recovered by police and determined to be of the same manufacture as the bullets found in the victims’ bodies.</p>

Appellant claims that the consideration of mercy or leniency is precluded by the statute’s direction that the court instruct the jury that “the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). Although it is true that the Pennsylvania death penalty statute does not allow a jury to avoid imposition of a death sentence through the exercise of an unbridled discretion to grant mercy or leniency, the statute permits the defendant to introduce a broad range of mitigating evidence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> that can support the finding of one or more mitigating circumstances which may outweigh the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.
