His expert opinion was based upon the premise that blood types are inheritable according to genetic principles and the generally accepted reliability of HLA tests.</p>

Ed Smith also testified that he was present when appellee’s mother took appellee and appellee’s sisters to truck stops, where the girls would leave Ed Smith in the car and go to various trucks and return with money. The purpose of this testimony was to raise an inference that, contrary to appellee’s assertions, she had engaged in sexual activity with persons other than appellant during the conception period.</p>

Nevertheless, the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial is within the trial court’s discretion. <em>Austin v.

Indeed, we have held that it is the duty of the trial court which heard the witnesses to grant a motion for new trial if it believes the jury’s verdict is capricious or against the weight of the evidence. <em>Burchard v.

The trial judge had an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses. We lack this advantage. Given the strength of the expert’s testimony and the less objectively reliable testimony of the other witnesses, I would defer to Common Pleas’ judgment. I believe our trial judges in general and this one in particular exercise their duty in regard to new trial motions responsibly and conscientiously.</p>
