This duty is mandatory and is imposed on lawyers because they are held to the highest standard of ethical and legal behavior. If lawyers are convicted of crimes which require discipline, and then are permitted to hide that fact from the Courts and the public, there is no question that the integrity of the bar will be lowered and that the public will perceive the profession to have been brought into disrepute.

That conduct, coupled with his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, requires that we accept the recommendation for discipline.

D.E. 214(a) in reaching its conclusion that disbarment is appropriate, I must dissent. I would issue a five-year suspension corresponding to the recommendation of the hearing committee and the minority members of the Disciplinary Board. The five-year suspension would be made <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>retroactive to July 13,1984, the effective date of the interim suspension of Harold Casety, Jr. by this Court.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[264,421,1142,407]]]'>I must also dissent from the majority’s retroactive application of Pa.R.D.E. 214(a). The majority acknowledges that the rule did not become effective until April 12, 1983. Harold Casety, Jr. was sentenced prior to the effective date of the rule. Although the rule specifically states that the conviction must be reported within twenty days of the date of sentencing, the majority interprets the rule as imposing a continuing obligation on attorneys to make such a report.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[262,845,1143,553]]]'>I do not agree with the majority’s interpretation. If the rule had been intended to impose a reporting requirement upon an attorney who had been sentenced prior to its enactment, the rule would have stated that an attorney who had been sentenced previously shall report the conviction within twenty days of the effective date of the rule. Although such an addition to the rule may have been desirable, the rule does not provide for the circumstance. I believe that the majority’s finding that Casety violated this rule is contrary to the unambiguous language of the rule itself.</p>
