Commonwealth Court entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth for $4,750.00 together with interest and costs. The sole issue in this appeal is whether a Pennsylvania corporation should be denied the benefit of the “family farm corporation” exemption from the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax, to which it is otherwise entitled, because it does not actually engage in farming, but leases its agricultural assets to another Pennsylvania corporation for operation. All of the stock of both corporations is owned by members of the same family. For the reasons set forth herein we conclude that the exemption should not be granted to this taxpayer and accordingly affirm.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[142,1098,1144,307]]]'>The stipulated facts are as follows: Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation which was formed in 1960. At all times since its incorporation, all of the issued and outstanding corporate stock of Appellant has been owned by members of the same family; namely, John B. Peters, his wife, Mary E.K. Peters, and their children.</p>

Peters individually until his retirement in 1974, and thereafter to John B. Peters, Inc.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Both lessees used these assets in their family farming operation. The reason for the leasing arrangement between the two corporations is that the four sons of John B. Peters are actively engaged <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>in the farming operation while his two daughters are not. The leasing arrangement therefore permits all of the Peters children to share in the ownership of the fruit farms, machinery and equipment, while only those children who earn their livelihood from farming, i.e., the four sons who actively engage in the farming operation, share in the profits realized therefrom. Thus, the Appellant corporation owns the capital assets, and the farming operation is carried on by John B. Peters, Inc., through the leasing arrangement. However, all the outstanding stock of both corporations is owned by the members of the John B. Peters family, and those family members constitute all of the officers and directors of both corporations.</p>

Commonwealth Court affirmed the denial of the exemption to Appellant and this appeal ensued.</p>

There is no question that Appellant satisfies the first and third requirements. The question presented is whether Appellant’s leasing activities constitute the “business of agriculture” within the meaning of Section 602.2(b)(1) of the Tax Reform Code, 72 Pa.S. § 7602.2(b)(1).</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[135,1316,1146,678]]]'>Initially, we note that a required rule of statutory construction provides that a statute exempting persons or property from taxation must be strictly construed. Section 1928(b)(5) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(5). Consistent with this rule, a taxpayer has the burden of proving that he is entitled to an exemption from taxation. <em>Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/498/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="498 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1776049" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0521-01">498 Pa. 521</a>, 525, <a href="/pa/498/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="498 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1776049" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0521-01">447 A.2d 948</a>, 950 (1982). It is also well-settled that the rules of statutory construction set forth in Chapter 19, 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1901 et seq., “shall be observed, unless the application of such rules would result in a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly”, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1901.</p>

Appellant further urges that the arrangement by which one Peters family corporation owns the family farming assets and leases them to another family corporation for operation was intended to serve the same purpose as the legislation at issue. Appellant, in essence, asks that we disregard the separate corporate entities for purposes of this exemption because both corporations are owned, operated and directed by essentially the same members of the same family, and but for the second corporation, Appellant would unquestionably be entitled to the exemption. As a second ground for reversal, Appellant asserts that the provision that seventy-five per cent (75%) of a qualifying corporation’s assets be “devoted to the business of agriculture” does not require that the family farm corporation be actively engaged in farming in order to qualify for the exemption, but only that its assets be so engaged. Appellant finds the language of the statute clear and unambiguous and contends that had the Legislature intended to limit the exemption to actively farming corporations it would have explicitly done so.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[269,1406,1144,475]]]'>Appellee, on the other hand, while conceding that Appellant meets the stock ownership requirement of the statute, asserts that Appellant’s leasing activities do not constitute the “business of agriculture” as contemplated by the exemption. Appellee argues that it is insufficient for purposes of the exemption that assets be devoted to the business of agriculture <em>by a lessee. </em>Rather, Appellee contends that the corporation seeking this exemption must itself actively engage in the business of agriculture. We agree.</p>

We are not here concerned with the manner in which Appellant chooses to structure its family business or the reasons underlying the two-corporation structure.

    <p id="b516-7" data-blocks='[["BL_516.8",516,[275,756,1145,524]]]'>To ascertain legislative intent in the instant case, it is helpful to review the previously proposed, but unenacted definition of a family farm corporation entitled to an exemption from the Capital Stock Tax. The unenacted definition was contained in House Bill No. 1608, Printer’s No. 1931 and read: “[f]amily farm corporation shall mean a corporation <em>organized </em>and <em>operated for </em>the <em>agricultural use </em>of land, wherein at least seventy-five per cent of all the stock is owned by members of the same family.” H.B. No. 1608, § 1(b)(1) (1979) (emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b516-8" data-blocks='[["BL_516.9",516,[274,1299,1146,577]]]'>The enacted definition clearly differs from this by defining a family farm corporation as a “ ... Pennsylvania corporation at least seventy-five per cent of the <em>assets </em>of which are <em>devoted to </em>the business of agriculture, — ” 72 P.S. § 7602.2(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). The adoption of this broader definition demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to require that the corporation actually engage in agriculture. Rather, it is only required, as done by appellant here, that the corporation devote at least seventy-five per cent of its <em>assets </em>— farmland and farm equipment — to the business of agriculture.</p>
    <p id="b516-9" data-blocks='[["BL_516.10",516,[274,1896,1143,153]]]'>Therefore, I would hold that appellant qualifies for the family farm corporation exemption from the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax.</p>

The appellant corporation clearly fulfills the requirements of the “family farm corporation” exemption <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>from the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax. The exemption defines “family farm corporation” as a “Pennsylvania corporation at least seventy-five per cent of the <em>assets </em>of which are <em>devoted to the business of </em>agriculture____” 72 P.S. § 7602.2 (emphasis added). There can be no question that the assets of the appellant corporation, to wit farmland and farm machinery, are devoted to the business of agriculture. The fact that the assets are leased to others who perform the actual farm work is immaterial, for the assets are still devoted to the business of agriculture. There is no language in the exemption to indicate that the legislature intended to limit the exemption so as to apply only to assets which are not leased. Indeed, the leasing of equipment and farmland is such a well-known common practice in the agricultural community that, had the legislature intended to regard such assets as not being devoted to the business of agriculture, the legislature surely would have so stated.</p>
