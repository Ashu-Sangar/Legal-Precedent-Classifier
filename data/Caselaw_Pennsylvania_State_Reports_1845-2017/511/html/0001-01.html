The victim was an habitual drug user and he was well known to the occupants of this location. The Commonwealth’s sole eyewitness, Janet Fleming, testified at trial that the victim visited this location on Christmas night, 1979, and informed the co-defendant in this case, Bobbie L. Sims, that he (the victim) wanted to purchase “speed.” After the victim claimed that he only <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>had $11.00 or $12.00 with him, Bobbie Sims indicated that he thought the victim had more money than that. Sims noticed that the victim was carrying a gun and ordered Janet Fleming to disarm him, and she testified that she did so. After Janet Fleming turned the gun over to Sims, she stated that Appellant came downstairs with a gun and was directed by Sims to “hold his gun” on the victim while Sims conducted a search. Sims removed the victim’s wallet, along with checks and other personal papers.</p>

While upstairs in the company of Cookie Brown (also known as Juanita Peck) and her teenage son, Walter Brown (neither of whom were called as witnesses at the trial by either side),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> they heard a shot. Walter Brown went downstairs and a second shot was heard. The second shot hit Walter Brown in the arm. Janet Fleming (along with at least one other person) followed Walter Brown downstairs and saw the victim tied up at this point and lying on his stomach, with his hands behind his back and blood about his head and face. Appellant and co-defendant Sims then led the victim into the living room, both threatening that if he didn’t “shut up” they would shoot him. When the victim refused to be quiet (he kept screaming), Appellant said, “I’m asking one more time to be quiet and if you don’t, I’m going to blow your brains out”; he then shot the <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>victim once, and the victim then jumped through a window in an effort to escape. A police officer found the victim on a porch outside of the house near a broken window, surrounded by broken glass. The victim died of a single gunshot wound and head injuries.</p>

Marcelle Hannibal, who lived nearby with one Carl Davis, testified for the Commonwealth that Bobbie Sims came to her home on the Christmas night in question and admitted “that he [Sims] had shot somebody____” “He said that he had shot some guy and he had jumped through the window.” She testified that Sims returned to the scene of the crime with Mr. Davis to demonstrate that his boast or brag was not an idle one.</p>

During direct examination by the Assistant District Attorney, in response to the question, “Who stuck him up and who tied him up?” (which was asked in connection with what Sims had admitted to the witness), Ms. Hilyard responded: “Bobbie and Lonnie” [Appellant Baker’s nickname]. This hearsay statement was objected to by Appellant’s trial counsel, and the court sustained the objection and gave a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the reference to Appellant. The fact that the jury heard this response prompted Appellant’s trial counsel to move for a mistrial, which was denied. The point has been preserved on this appeal and is discussed below.</p>

On the evening of January 7, 1980, someone, whom Bobbie Sims identified as his sister, gave a $400.00 check, payable to the victim, to an oil company delivery man as payment for a $130.00 bill. The delivery man could not <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>change the check but took it with him, and the next day Sims himself went to the offices of the fuel oil company to get change for the check where he was apprehended by the police and taken in for questioning. When apprehended, Sims was in possession of a wallet that contained thirty items of identification belonging to the victim. He was, nevertheless, not charged with murder at that time because of insufficient evidence. At trial, Sims admitted to the incidents of January 7 and 8, 1980, but claimed that he received the items in question from Janet Fleming and denied any involvement in the killing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellant subsequently wore civilian clothes. Motions to disqualify the five jurors already selected were denied. Appellant complained that he had been wearing prison garb in the presence of these five jurors, but Judge Sabo could not find any descriptive feature of these dungarees which could identify them to the jurors as prison garb. The trial court agreed to allow the jurors to be interrogated concerning their observations of Appellant’s clothing at the completion of the jury selection; however, the matter was not raised at that time (possibly because to do so would have unduly emphasized the issue). The point has, however, been preserved for review by this Court.</p>

The Commonwealth’s case against Appellant rested solely on the testimony of Janet Fleming, an alleged accessory to the crime, who was given immunity to testify by the Commonwealth. The jury was specifically instructed by the Court that if Janet Fleming was found by them to be an accomplice, her testimony should be looked upon with disfavor because it came from a corrupt and polluted source, and that her testimony had to be examined closely, and only accepted with caution and care. Janet Fleming had a past criminal record. She admitted to using drugs illegally three times a day since the age of 17, to having used drugs (“monster”) on the night of the killing, and to having had intimate relations with co-defendant Sims on a number of occasions during the five years prior to the killing. A review of the transcript of her testimony shows it to be somewhat confusing in spots, especially on cross-examination. Portions of her prior consistent statement given to the police in June, 1981, were read into the record by the Assistant District Attorney on re-direct examination.</p>

He justified his refusal to dismiss on the grounds that the jury had had only one hour to deliberate the previous night (allowing two hours for dinner). Meanwhile, the jury, continuing to deliberate, had sent Judge Sabo a question asking, “Must you consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances to reach the decision of life imprisonment? May we have a yes or no answer?” The Assistant District Attorney, after initial reluctance, apparently concluded that the jury was leaning against his position because he came around to agree with Judge Sabo’s view that the question should be answered “yes.” Judge Sabo gave the jury the answer “yes.”</p>

After five jurors had been selected, it was brought to the attention of the trial court that co-defendant Bobbie Sims was not dressed in the civilian clothing that had been provided for him. A discussion then ensued concerning Sims’ decision to forego wearing civilian clothes during the jury selection. At the conclusion of this discussion, Appellant raised the issue of his own clothing for the first time. Judge Sabo then rendered his own observation that Appellant’s blue-colored clothing did not appear to be prison-issue, but rather ordinary dungarees. Trial counsel subsequently moved to disqualify the five jurors that had already been selected. Upon denial of this motion, counsel requested that the jurors be interrogated concerning their observations of Appellant’s clothing. The trial court agreed to allow the jurors to be questioned at the completion of jury selection, <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>but as already noted, the matter was never brought up again.</p>

The trial court here clearly did not order Appellant to stand trial in prison garb. He was afforded every opportunity to wear civilian clothing during the trial. The garments he elected to wear during the initial stage of jury selection were, in Judge Sabo’s view, not readily identifiable as prison clothing. At the Evidentiary Hearing ordered by this Court, trial counsel testified that while Appellant’s clothing <em>seemed </em>to be institutional-type, there was something about them that did not upset him for the first few days of the trial. Under these circumstances, Judge Sabo stated that he was convinced that Appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the clothing he was wearing.</p>

While the issue has not been raised on appeal, and we feel no need to address it since for other reasons the death sentence in this case must be reduced to life imprisonment without parole, we are nevertheless troubled that when the jury returned hopelessly deadlocked here, counsel were not immediately summoned, and that the decision to send the jury back for further deliberations was made without prior consultation with counsel. It is now axiomatic that a criminal defendant must be effectively represented by counsel at all critical stages of the proceeding. See, <em>Mempa v. Rhay, </em><a href="/us/389/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="389 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11335632" data-case-paths="/us/389/0128-01">389 U.S. 128</a>, <a href="/us/389/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="389 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11335632" data-case-paths="/us/389/0128-01">88 S.Ct. 254</a>, <a href="/us/389/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="389 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11335632" data-case-paths="/us/389/0128-01">19 L.Ed.2d 336</a> (1967). That requirement was not met here. Defense counsel <em>might </em>have been persuasive in convincing the trial court that further deliberations were unwarranted. See, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(v). Defense counsel <em>might </em>also have argued that special <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>instructions had to be given to a hopelessly deadlocked jury informing them that if an unanimous death verdict could not be reached, that defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. See, <em>State v. Williams, </em><a href="/so2d/392/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="392 So. 2d 619" data-case-ids="9560037" data-case-paths="/so2d/392/0619-01">392 So.2d, 619</a> (La.1980).

Appellant's argument cannot be considered waived because of trial counsel’s failure to object to the Assistant District Attorney's comments. A limited relaxation of the waiver rules exists in death penalty cases and that doctrine must apply here. <em>Commonwealth v. Holcomb, </em><a href="/pa/508/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="508 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1793996,1794001" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0425-01,/pa/508/0425-02">508 Pa. 425</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="508 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1793996,1794001" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0425-01,/pa/508/0425-02">498 A.2d 833</a> (1985).

This Court (along with Federal Courts) has always sought to guard and protect jealously the rights that all citizens enjoy under the law and under both the United States Constitution and that of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To suggest that a defendant be given a death sentence because we will somehow be derelict in following the law or the Constitution is utterly outrageous.</p>
