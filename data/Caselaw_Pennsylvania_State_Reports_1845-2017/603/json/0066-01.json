See Commonwealth v. Green, 957 A.2d 1238, 1243 (Colville, S.J., concurring and dissenting). The Superior Court inappropriately presumed respondent\u2019s counsel had no reasonable cause for not seeking reconsideration of respondent\u2019s sentence. Further, the court erred in presuming respondent was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to file a post-sentence motion challenging the sentence. See Commonwealth v. Reed, 971 A.2d 1216, 1225 (Pa.2009) (noting only three circumstances this Court has recognized counsel\u2019s conduct warranted presumption of prejudice). Upon remand, the PCRA court shall hold a hearing to determine whether respondent\u2019s trial counsel had reasonable basis not to file a post-trial motion seeking reconsideration of respondent\u2019s sentence. If counsel lacked reasonable basis, the PCRA court shall determine whether counsel\u2019s failure to file a post-sentence motion prejudiced respondent.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice SAYLOR dissents.",
