        "text": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nBryan Sean Galvin appeals the judgment of sentence of death imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County on September 6, 2007, following a jury trial. The jury convicted Appellant of first-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, receiving stolen property, and unauthorized use of automobile and other vehicles. Additionally, the trial court found Appellant guilty of the summary offenses of driving without lights to avoid identification or arrest and periods for requiring lighted lamps. For the reasons offered below, we find the issues raised by Appellant are without merit. Thus, we affirm the convictions and judgment of sentence.\nThe evidence of record establishes the following facts. At approximately 3:00 a.m. on January 31, 2006, Officer Nicholas Hine, Sr. of the Cumru Township Police Department, on patrol in the Borough of Kenhorst, Berks County, Pennsylvania, observed a maroon 1988 Ford Aerostar van travelling on New Holland Road. The van was heading toward Nolde Forest, a wooded public park and operating without its headlights illuminated. Based upon this violation of the Motor Vehicle Code, Officer Hine activated his overhead lights in an attempt to stop the van. The van made numerous evasive turns through the streets and alleyways of Kenhorst before ultimately coming to a stop.\nAn individual, later identified through his driver\u2019s license as Appellant, exited the van, and walked toward Officer Hine\u2019s patrol car. After being ordered twice to return to his vehicle, Appellant returned to the van. Officer Hine radioed for assistance. While waiting for the backup officers to arrive, Officer Hine observed through the window of the van what appeared to be a human leg with a peace sign tattooed on the skin, with a white sneaker on the foot. After observing this body, Officer Hine instructed Appellant, through the P.A. system of his patrol car, for Appellant to turn off the engine of the van and throw the key out of the window with his left hand. The key was on a ring with a \u201cJello\u201d key fob. Officer Hine also noticed that a piece of plastic was broken off of the van\u2019s bumper. Shortly thereafter, Officer Hine was joined by Sergeant Scott Bechtel and Officer James Griffith.\nAs the officers approached the van, Sergeant Bechtel observed a large, approximately 400-pound white male, later determined to be Kristofer Kolesnik, lying in the back of the van. Kolesnik was wrapped in a large white sheet or tarp which was tied with yellow electrical cord. There appeared to be blood on Kolesnik\u2019s chest and on the sheet, and he did not appear to be breathing. After directing Appellant to exit the vehicle and lie on the ground, Officer Hine asked if there was anyone else in the van, to which Appellant responded, \u201cjust a dead guy,\u201d or \u201conly the dead guy.\u201d N.T., 8/6/07, at 59, 106. Subsequently, EMS personnel who were summoned to the scene confirmed Kolesnik was not breathing and had no heartbeat, and determined that he was dead.\nAlso at this time, Officer Hine and Sergeant Bechtel observed a red gasoline can placed on the front passenger seat, which was later determined to be full of gasoline. Additionally, Sergeant Bechtel saw a Motorola cellular telephone lying in the center console of the van. After Appellant was taken into custody, Sergeant Bechtel noticed blood on Appellant\u2019s pant leg, boot, wrist watch, and glasses. The officers transported Appellant to the Cumru Township Police Department. There, Appellant was placed in a holding cell and instructed not to wash his hands in the sink. Later, however, Appellant was observed by a surveillance camera, dunking his hands into the toilet bowel and rubbing them together.\nThrough Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, the police were able to obtain the address of Appellant\u2019s residence \u2014 312 South 18th Street, Reading, Pennsylvania. Investigators were dispatched to Appellant\u2019s residence to search for pieces of broken bumper from the van, which had been impounded after the removal of the victim\u2019s body. Upon his arrival at Appellant\u2019s residence, Sergeant Guy Lehman of the Reading Police Department observed fresh blood leading from the sidewalk to the front door of the residence, and a wooden broom with blood on it, on the sidewalk. Based upon his observation of what he believed to be fresh blood spread across the front of the residence, and his fear that there may have been other victims inside the residence who may require medical attention, Sergeant Lehman called for assistance and determined that it was prudent to conduct a security check of the residence.\nThereafter, Criminal Investigators William Strickler and Andrew Shearer arrived at Appellant\u2019s residence. Investigator Strickler knocked on the front door of the residence. Initially, there was no response. After knocking a second time, Investigator Strickler heard a faint muffled voice coming from inside the residence. Investigator Strickler pushed open the front door, and three officers entered the residence. The officers proceeded room-by-room in search of individuals in the apartment. The officers checked a living room, a kitchen, a rear bathroom, and a bedroom where they encountered William Galvin, Appellant\u2019s father, who was lying on a bed. Appellant\u2019s father was not injured or in need of medical care. The officers explained why they were in the apartment, gave him an opportunity to dress, and then escorted him from the apartment so that the security check could be completed.\nProceeding to the next room, which was later determined to be Appellant\u2019s bedroom, the officers observed a bullet shell casing and blood on the carpet. After assuring themselves there were no additional victims or persons requiring medical attention, the officers vacated the residence. Outside the residence, the officers found a piece of plastic bumper along the curb and sidewalk directly beneath a damaged porch post, which later was determined the match the damage to the van.\nInvestigator Shearer prepared a search warrant, and a magisterial district judge issued the warrant authorizing a search of the premises. Pursuant to the search of the residence, the officers recovered from Appellant\u2019s bedroom a rifle shell casing, a shell casing on a dresser, a discharged bullet projectile, an impact indentation on the wall directly above the bullet, yellow electrical wire (which later was determined to have been the source of the wire wrapped around Kolesnik\u2019s body), yellow wire cutters (which later were determined to have cut the wire used to secure the tarp around the victim\u2019s body), a pool of blood at the foot of the bed, a pool of blood on the mattress, and a larger pool of blood on the underside of the mattress. Additionally, the search uncovered a Brinks lock box, which was located underneath the bed in Appellant\u2019s bedroom. Subsequently, a district judge issued a second search warrant authorizing the seizure of the contents of the lock box, which we discuss below.\nDr. Samuel Land, a certified forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy of Kolesnik\u2019s body. The autopsy revealed that Kolesnik\u2019s death was a result of a gunshot wound to the head. The autopsy also disclosed that a boot lace was wrapped around Kolesnik\u2019s left arm in a fashion associated with intravenous drug use. Injection sites on Kolesnik\u2019s arms were observed and toxicology reports revealed the presence of morphine, codeine, and alcohol in Kolesnik\u2019s body.\nFinally, additional evidence adduced at trial established that, on January 27, 2006, at an A-Plus minimarket on Perkiomen Avenue in Reading, Appellant and Kolesnik engaged in a heated argument regarding $20.00 and a cellular telephone. Three days later, on January 30, 2006, Wendy Hess, the victim\u2019s girlfriend with whom he lived, picked up Kolesnik after he finished his shift with the Reading Metro Taxi Company. The two returned to their home in Reading. After eating a meal, Hess and Kolesnik went to bed. When Hess awoke at 1:45 p.m., Kolesnik was gone and had evidently taken Hess\u2019 maroon van with him. In the interim, at approximately 12:15 p.m., Kolesnik went to the A-Plus minimarket on Perkiomen Avenue where he was confronted by Appellant regarding the return of a cellular telephone.\nAppellant was tried before a jury, commencing August 6, 2007. The jury found Appellant guilty of the above-stated crimes, including first-degree murder. On August 13, 2007, the jury found the aggravating circumstance that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). The jury also found as a mitigating circumstance that Appellant committed three of his prior felonies when he was a juvenile. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). The jury concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance and rendered a verdict of death. On September 6, 2007, the trial court formally sentenced Appellant to death and a consecutive, aggregate sentence of no less than 5 nor more than 11 years\u2019 imprisonment for the convictions for abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, and theft by unlawful taking. The trial court imposed no further sentence on the remaining crimes. On September 27, 2007, Appellant filed a notice of appeal, and, on March 13, 2008, the trial court rendered its 1925(a) opinion, denying Appellant relief. This appeal followed.\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nIt is our Court\u2019s practice to review the sufficiency of the evidence for first-degree murder in all direct appeals from the imposition of capital punishment irrespective of whether the appellant mounts a sufficiency challenge. Commonwealth v. Champney, 574 Pa. 435, 442, 832 A.2d 403, 407 (2003); Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 26 n. 3, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982). In the appeal s%ib judice, Appellant claims that his conviction for first-degree murder, as well as his convictions for theft by unlawful taking, and receiving stolen property, was not supported by sufficient evidence. In reviewing a claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to allow the fact finder to find every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. LaCava, 542 Pa. 160, 171, 666 A.2d 221, 226 (1995). In doing so, a reviewing court views all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Id. Furthermore, in applying this standard, the Commonwealth may sustain its burden of proof by means of wholly circumstantial evidence. Commonwealth v. Cousar, 593 Pa. 204, 217, 928 A.2d 1025, 1032 (2007). When performing its review, an appellate court should evaluate the entire record and all evidence received is to be considered, whether or not the trial court\u2019s rulings thereon were correct. Additionally, we note that the trier of fact, while passing on the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. Id. at 217, 928 A.2d at 1032-33. With these tenets in mind, we turn to Appellant\u2019s arguments concerning the sufficiency of the evidence.\nA. First-Degree Murder\nFirst, Appellant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for murder in the first degree. Specifically, Appellant offers that there is no evidence to establish either that he killed Kolesnik or that he had the specific intent to kill. No testimony placed him at his residence when Kolesnik was shot, and similarly, no evidence established that Appellant owned a gun or fired a gun as there was no residue found on his clothing or person. Moreover, evidence suggested that Kolesnik had a long history of heroin addiction and that he was despondent over his inability to be free from this addiction. Appellant avers that Dr. Land, who testified on behalf of the Commonwealth, could not tell from the observation of Kolesnik\u2019s body whether or not the gunshot wound was self-inflicted. According to Appellant, while Kolesnik\u2019s DNA was found on Appellant\u2019s watch, this was consistent with Appellant moving the body, but not that he was present when Kolesnik died. Thus, Appellant complains that the evidence was insufficient to uphold the conviction for first-degree murder.\nThe Commonwealth responds that its theory of the murder was that Appellant, upset over circumstances surrounding his brother\u2019s incarceration, shot Kolesnik in the head while Kolesnik was in the process of injecting heroin in Appellant\u2019s bedroom. Appellant then loaded Kolesnik\u2019s body into the van, intending to destroy both the body and the vehicle. Conversely, Appellant\u2019s theory was that Kolesnik shot himself in the head after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing. When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, the Commonwealth maintains that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Appellant killed Kolesnik and that Appellant did so with specific intent.\nTo prove murder of the first-degree, the Commonwealth must establish that: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with malice and a specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2501, 2502(d); Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 598 Pa. 621, 629, 959 A.2d 916, 921 (2008). \u201cIntentional killing\u201d is defined as including killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(d). The specific intent essential to support a first-degree murder conviction may be shown by use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Commonwealth v. Rivera, 565 Pa. 289, 295, 773 A.2d 131, 135 (2001).\nUpon review, we believe that the evidence adduced at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of first-degree murder. The evidence supports a finding that a human being was unlawfully killed, as the victim, Kolesnik, died from a gunshot wound to the head. Evidence further supports a finding that the person accused, Appellant, was responsible for the death of the victim and that Appellant acted with malice and specific intent to kill.\nSpecifically, the evidence established that 15 hours before Kolesnik\u2019s body was found in the back of Hess\u2019 van, Appellant and Kolesnik were together at an A-Plus minimarket. Kolesnik was to go to Appellant\u2019s house later that day to return a cellular telephone-, a source of controversy between the men, and which sparked an argument\u2019 between Kolesnik and Appellant a few days earlier at the same store. The evidence places Kolesnik at Appellant\u2019s residence where DNA analysis matches Kolesnik\u2019s DNA with that of blood on Appellant\u2019s mattress and a bullet. A trail of blood led from Appellant\u2019s residence to the curb. Appellant was stopped while driving a van, operating without the use of headlights, and while heading towards Nolde Forest, a secluded wooded park. When asked by police if anyone else was in the vehicle, Appellant responded, \u201cjust a dead guy\u201d or \u201conly the dead guy.\u201d In the cargo area of the van was Kolesnik\u2019s body and on the front passenger seat was a container full of gasoline. Kolesnik\u2019s body was wrapped in a blood-soaked covering, bound with electrical wire, which matched wire recovered from Appellant\u2019s room. Also, located in the vehicle was a cellular telephone belonging to Appellant\u2019s brother. Appellant was observed with blood on his pants, watch, and glasses. The blood on Appellant\u2019s watch matched Kolesnik\u2019s DNA. After being arrested, Appellant was instructed not to wash his hands, yet, Appellant attempted to wash his hands in a toilet bowl in his holding cell. Finally, Commonwealth witness, Dr. Land, an expert in forensic pathology, believed that the circumstances surrounding Kolesnik\u2019s death, combined with the crime scene evidence, strongly suggested a homicide. Dr. Land pointed to the fact that Kolesnik had a ligature still tied around his left arm, consistent with present drug use. As Dr. Land opined, because Kolesnik was right-handed, he would have had to have been shooting drugs into his left arm, yet, the entrance wound was in the left side of Kolesnik\u2019s head. This evidence, coupled with an attempt to hide the murder and the lack of notice to the police of a suicide, all pointed away from suicide and toward a finding of a homicide. Based upon this evidence, we hold that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s conviction of first-degree murder.\nB. Theft By Unlawful Taking\nAdditionally, Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish theft by unlawful taking. While Appellant acknowledges that he was stopped operating Hess\u2019 van and was operating the van with a key attached to Hess\u2019 Jello key fob, according to Appellant, it could be inferred that Kolesnik had permission to use Hess\u2019 van, because Kolesnik and Hess lived together and were boyfriend and girlfriend. Moreover, evidence existed that Kolesnik and Appellant were friends. Appellant maintains that the Commonwealth did not present evidence that he did not have permission from Kolesnik to use the van or that he intended to deprive Hess of the van. Thus, as the evidence fails to establish that he intended to deprive Hess of her van, Appellant claims that the evidence does not support a conviction of theft by unlawful taking.\nThe Commonwealth points to Hess\u2019 testimony that the van belonged to her, that there was only one key to the van, and that the van key was on her Jello key chain. Moreover, Hess testified that she did not give her key ring to Appellant or give him permission to operate the vehicle. Furthermore, the Commonwealth submits that circumstantial evidence supported the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, accepted by the jury it contends, that Appellant killed Kolesnik and placed his body into the van with the intent to dispose of both the body and the van. Supporting this view, the Commonwealth notes that a full gasoline container was found on the front passenger seat of the van, and Hess testified that the gasoline container was previously empty in the cargo area of the van and was filled only if the van ran out of gas.\nThe trial court found the evidence sufficient to establish Appellant\u2019s conviction for theft by unlawful taking. Citing to the evidence offered by the Commonwealth above, the trial court concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Appellant possessed the requisite intent to deprive Hess of her van.\nTo uphold a conviction for theft by unlawful taking, the Commonwealth must establish the accused \u201cunlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921(a). We find that the evidence was sufficient to establish a theft by unlawful taking. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, with all reasonable inferences drawn there from, and as set forth by the Commonwealth and the trial court, Appellant was found operating Hess\u2019 van, using the only keys to the vehicle, without Hess\u2019 permission. Appellant was driving the van towards a secluded wooded area, Nolde Forest, in the early morning hours without its headlights illuminated. In the cargo area of the van was the body of Hess\u2019 live-in boyfriend, and in the front passenger seat of the van was a container filled with gasoline. Based upon the evidence of record, as properly considered, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Appellant exercised unlawful control over Hess\u2019 van with the intent to deprive her thereof. Thus, Appellant\u2019s claim fails.\nC. Receiving Stolen Property\nFinally, Appellant complains that the evidence was insufficient to establish his conviction for receiving stolen property. Appellant points to the short time period from when the van was last seen by Hess and when the police stopped him while operating the van. He also highlights evidence that Appellant and Kolesnik were friends and contends that there is no evidence whether Kolesnik gave him permission to use Hess\u2019 van. Furthermore, Appellant develops that he voluntarily stopped the van after being ordered to by police, that he was cooperative -with police, and that the van was not taken far from the residence of the owner. According to Appellant, all of these factors suggest the evidence is insufficient to establish that Appellant did not intend to restore the van to its owner, a necessary requirement to establish the crime of receiving stolen property.\nThe Commonwealth provides, in sum, that the same facts sufficient to establish the elements of theft by unlawful taking also support the conviction for receiving stolen property. The trial court agreed.\nReceiving stolen property is established by proving that the accused \u201cintentionally receives, retains, or disposes of movable property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it has probably been stolen, unless the property is received, retained, or disposed of with intent to restore it to the owner.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3925(a). We conclude the evidence of record established the elements of receiving stolen property. Again, Appellant was stopped by police while driving Hess\u2019 van, without her permission, using her keys. Appellant was driving the van, without headlights illuminated, in the direction of Nolde Forest, with Kolesnik\u2019s body, as well as a container filled with gasoline. While Appellant offers a different scenario to explain the course of events, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Appellant retained Hess\u2019 van, knowing it was stolen, and that he did not intend to return the van to Hess. Thus, we reject Appellant\u2019s sufficiency claims.\nII. Weight of the Evidence\nIn a related claim, Appellant alleges that the verdict of murder in the first degree was against the weight of the evidence. Specifically, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Land, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that the cause of death of Kolesnik was a gunshot wound to the head and that the manner of death was homicide. Yet, as Appellant asserts, Dr. Land could not determine, solely by examining the victim\u2019s body, if the manner of death was a suicide or a homicide. Appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. John Shane, an expert in both forensic pathology and toxicology, testified that the manner of death was a suicide, stating that the victim had an extremely high level of opiates in his system, that this constituted a suicide attempt by injecting such a large quantity of opiates. He also offered that the victim was attempting suicide by two means \u2014 a gunshot wound to the head and overdosing on opiates. Appellant reasons that; based upon this conflicting testimony between the Commonwealth\u2019s expert and his expert, the weight of the evidence does not support a verdict of guilty for murder of the first degree.\nAppellant also claims that his convictions of theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property are against the weight of the evidence. With respect to both challenges, and similar to his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges, Appellant offers that, as Kolesnik had permission to use the van, he in turn had the authority to give permission to others to use the van. Appellant points out that the Commonwealth failed to provide evidence that the victim did not allow Appellant to use the van, and, therefore, Appellant avers that there was no evidence presented that Appellant was not given permission to use the van by Kolesnik before his death. Furthermore, Appellant maintains he was found operating the van belonging to Hess less than one day after she had last seen the van and he was using the proper key for the vehicle. Thus, Appellant asserts that the weight of the evidence did not support a finding that he did not plan on restoring the van to Hess and that he intended to permanently deprive her of the van. Therefore, according to Appellant, the convictions for theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property were against the weight of the evidence.\nAn allegation that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence is addressed to the discretion of the trial court. Cousar, 593 Pa. at 222, 928 A.2d at 1035-36. A new trial is awarded only when the verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice. Id. at 222, 928 A.2d at 1036. Appellate review is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on the weight claim, and not the underlying question of whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. Id. Based upon the above, it is plain that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on a weight of the evidence claim is the least assailable of its rulings.\u201d Id. at 223, 928 A.2d at 1036.\nOur review of the record reveals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Appellant\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence claims. First, the testimony established that Kolesnik died from a gunshot wound to the head. The jury concluded that Appellant was the perpetrator and that he possessed the requisite specific intent for first-degree murder. While Appellant\u2019s argument focuses on allegedly conflicting testimony by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert and his expert, he fails to acknowledge that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert strongly indicated Kolesnik\u2019s death was a homicide. Moreover, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the defense testimony. Commonwealth v. Vandivner, 599 Pa. 617, 631, 962 A.2d 1170, 1178 (2009). Evidently, the jury disbelieved Appellant\u2019s expert that Kolesnik shot himself in an attempted suicide. Thus, Appellant\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence challenge is without merit.\nSimilarly, Appellant\u2019s assertions that the verdicts for theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property were against the weight of the evidence fail. The Commonwealth offered direct and circumstantial evidence that Appellant did not have permission to use Hess\u2019 van, that Appellant had Hess\u2019 keys, and that Appellant killed Kolesnik, loaded the victim\u2019s body into the van, drove the body toward a secluded wooded park, and brought with him a container filled with gasoline, all with the intent to dispose of both the body and the van. The jury found the elements of theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property were satisfied. We simply cannot conclude that the jury\u2019s verdicts were so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice. Thus, the trial court acted within its discretion in rejecting Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence.\nIII. Suppression\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for suppression of the physical evidence seized from his apartment where the initial warrantless entry was made without probable cause and where there were no exigent circumstances present to justify a warrantless search. First, Appellant offers that the police had the victim\u2019s body for 5 hours prior to finding the alleged blood trail at 312 South 18th Street. Moreover, Appellant claims that his father did not see any blood when he was escorted by police from the apartment. Furthermore, the police had no way of connecting the blood outside of the apartment to the victim. Appellant asserts that the officers at the apartment had no reason to conclude that there were any victims inside of the apartment. According to Appellant, it was only after the police heard a faint voice from inside the apartment, after their second knock on the front door, that the police decided to conduct a security check. Appellant suggests that this series of events is even questionable, as his father was the only individual in the apartment and he was asleep. In sum, Appellant maintains that the police manufactured the exigency in order to avoid the warrant requirement. Additionally, Appellant contends that, rather than a security cheek, the police were engaging in a concentrated search, as, according to Appellant\u2019s father, the police were in the apartment for at least 10 minutes before escorting him outside. Moreover, Appellant\u2019s father testified that, upon his leaving the premises, he heard one of the police officers indicate that he had found something, which suggests a search rather than a security check.\nAppellant also challenges the affidavit of probable cause as it failed to set forth a proper nexus between the death of the victim and the search of Appellant\u2019s apartment. The affidavit stated only that Appellant was operating a van which had a dead body in the back cargo area, and, according to Appellant, the only connection between Appellant and the apartment was it was on his driver\u2019s license when he was stopped by police. Related thereto, Appellant asserts that blood on the sidewalk failed to establish that a crime occurred inside the residence, and, thus, failed to set forth circumstances to support a finding of probable cause.\nThe Commonwealth retorts that the initial warrantless entry into Appellant\u2019s apartment was permitted under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Specifically, the Commonwealth offers that an exception exists where there is a danger to police or others. This includes situations in which it is believed that someone within a residence is in danger or in need of assistance. Additionally, the Commonwealth submits that the warrantless entry was a security check designed to ensure that there were no additional victims inside the residence. According to the Commonwealth, this was a protective sweep which has been sanctioned as constitutionally permissible.\nThe Commonwealth further offers that, here, the officers were investigating a grave offense where a dead body was observed in the vehicle driven by Appellant. The officers observed what appeared to be fresh damage to the vehicle, and officers were dispatched to the residence of the driver to investigate as to the damaged vehicle parts. The Commonwealth argues that, once at the scene, the officers had probable cause to suspect a crime was committed at the subject premises, due to the fact that a dead body was found in a van driven by Appellant, and a fresh trail of blood was located outside of his residence leading into the apartment. Furthermore, out of concern for additional victims within the residence in need of medical attention, based upon the trail of blood outside of the residence, as well as a muffled voice coming from inside the residence, the officers entered the residence. Finding no additional victims, the officers vacated the premises and awaited a warrant.\nAdditionally, the Commonwealth maintains that, to the extent Appellant claims that the search warrant pertaining to his residence was issued without probable cause, such claim is without merit. The Commonwealth submits that, as the police were lawfully in Appellant\u2019s residence under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, they could have seized incriminating items in plain view. Nevertheless, the police vacated the premises, and awaited a warrant. Here the warrant issued was supported by the fact that Appellant was stopped while driving a van containing a dead body. Appellant was splattered with blood. At Appellant\u2019s residence, the officers observed a fresh trail of blood leading from the sidewalk to the front door, as well as a broom with blood on it. According to the Commonwealth, this alone would have provided sufficient probable cause for the issuance of a warrant for the residence. Moreover, once the officers were lawfully inside of the residence, they observed various items in plain view of an incriminating nature which were readily apparent. These items included the pool of blood near Appellant\u2019s bed and a bullet shell casing.\nThe suppression court determined that the initial entry into Appellant\u2019s home prior to securing a search warrant was permissible as a result of exigent circumstances. The court noted that Appellant was found driving another person\u2019s vehicle, he had blood on his pants, watch, and glasses. There was a corpse wrapped in a tarp in the back of the van. Outside Appellant\u2019s residence, the police observed a trail of blood leading to Appellant\u2019s home, and, after knocking on the front door, the police heard a muffled human voice coming from within the residence. Due to the reasonable concern that additional victims could be in the residence, the court concluded that the police were legally permitted to enter the residence to secure the location. The court also considered the sufficiency of the affidavits in support of the search warrant for Appellant\u2019s residence. Based upon the officers\u2019 observations during the lawful warrantless security check of Appellant\u2019s residence due to exigent circumstances, the suppression court found the affidavit established probable cause for the issuance of a warrant and the subsequent search and seizure.\nIn reviewing a suppression ruling, we are bound by the suppression court\u2019s factual findings, unless they are without support in the record. Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 567 Pa. 415, 427-28, 787 A.2d 394, 401 (2001). We may reverse the legal conclusions reached by the suppression court, however, if they are in error. Id. Thus, our standard of review of the legal conclusions reached by the suppression court is de novo. Where, as here, the defendant is appealing the ruling of the suppression court, we consider only the evidence of the prosecution, and so much of the evidence for the defense which remains uncontradicted when fairly read in the context of the entire record. Id.\nGenerally, the police will be excused from compliance with the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution in only limited circumstances. One of these circumstances is when the police reasonably believe that someone within a residence is in need of immediate aid. Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978); Commonwealth v. Miller, 555 Pa. 354, 364, 724 A.2d 895, 900 (1999); Commonwealth v. Silo, 509 Pa. 406, 410, 502 A.2d 173, 175 (1985). The suppression court found that the police reasonably believed that additional victims could be inside Appellant\u2019s residence based upon, inter alia, their finding of a trail of fresh blood leading to Appellant\u2019s residence and the hearing of a faint voice coming from within the home. While the police in this matter were investigating a crime, the suppression court did not find, which the record provides no basis to question, that it is a case where the police created their own exigency and acted upon it. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Melendez, 544 Pa. 323, 330, 676 A.2d 226, 229 (1996). Based upon these circumstances, we conclude that the suppression court\u2019s factual findings were supported by the record and its legal conclusions regarding the existence of exigent circumstances creating an exception to the warrant requirement was legally sound. Therefore, we hold that the initial entry into Appellant\u2019s residence prior to securing a search warrant was legally permissible due to exigent circumstances. Thus, we next assess whether the search warrant was supported by probable cause.\nIn determining whether a search warrant is supported by probable cause, appellate review is confined to the four corners of the affidavit. Commonwealth v. Coleman, 574 Pa. 261, 271, 830 A.2d 554, 560 (2003). Probable cause, in turn, is a practical, non-technical concept which requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances. Id. The district judge that is requested to issue a warrant makes a practical, common-sense determination as to whether, given all of the facts and circumstances provided in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of the persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a certain locale. The duty of the reviewing court is to simply ensure that the district judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Id. at 271-72, 830 A.2d at 560 (quoting Commonwealth v. Gray, 509 Pa. 476, 484, 503 A.2d 921, 925 (1985), in turn quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).\nThe warrant at issue in this appeal identified the items to be searched at the 312 South 18th Street residence as:\nBlood, clothing, light colored electrical wire, bedding, tarps, DNA, hairs, fibers, firearms, amunition [sic], cleaning materials, brooms, mops, cutting instruments and tools, measurements, photographs, video tape, records of ownership and occupancy, and any other forensic evidence which may be related to this case.\nCommonwealth Exhibit No. 41, N.T., 8/6/07, at 967.\nHere, the affidavits of probable cause offered in support of the search warrant provided a description of the police observing Appellant driving the van at night without its headlights illuminated, the stopping of the van, the observation, in plain view, of Kolesnik\u2019s body, which was covered in a tarp which was wrapped with electrical wire, and on which there was blood. Additionally, the affidavits contained the officers\u2019 observations of blood on Appellant\u2019s leg, wrist watch, and glasses. The affidavits also contained the police officers\u2019 observations of fresh blood leading from the front door of Appellant\u2019s residence to the sidewalk, and a blood-covered broom on the sidewalk. Moreover, the affidavits described the officers\u2019 approach to the door to determine if persons were in need of emergency treatment, the hearing of a faint voice, and the officers\u2019 entry into the residence. Finally, the affidavits described the officers\u2019 search for persons within the residence, and the observations of the officers once inside the residence. Specifically, the affidavits referenced the officers\u2019 observation of a fresh pool of blood on the carpet next to the bed and an expended bullet shell casing on the floor next to the bed.\nBased upon our review of the facts and circumstances set forth in the affidavits of probable cause in support of the search warrant, we believe that the district judge properly concluded that there was a fair probability that evidence of the crime would be found at Appellant\u2019s residence, and the district judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. In response to Appellant\u2019s ai'gument that the observations of the officers while in his apartment should not have been part of the affidavit, we note that the officers were legally within Appellant\u2019s residence. Police officers are not required to close their eyes to matters in plain view while they are at a legal vantage point. Thus, their observations while in Appellant\u2019s residence were properly considered as part of the affidavits. Furthermore, the information contained in the affidavits in support of the search warrant, even excluding the observations of the police officers while inside Appellant\u2019s residence, was probative \u2014 establishing a nexus between Appellant, who was stopped with Kolesnik\u2019s corpse, the fresh blood observed outside of Appellant\u2019s residence leading to the front door of the apartment, and Appellant\u2019s residence. Therefore, based upon the information contained in the affidavits in support of the search warrant, we concluded that the, suppression court properly rejected Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.\nIV. Suppression of Lock Box\nAppellant also contends, in a cursory argument, that the only reason a lock box was discovered was due to the initial warrantless entry which resulted in the initial search warrant by police. Once the observations made by police are removed from the affidavit, Appellant maintains that there is not probable cause to search the residence. Furthermore, Appellant asserts that the only reference to the lock box was that it was located in Appellant\u2019s bedroom, under the bed where the police observed a pool of blood. Appellant submits that the affidavit of probable cause is devoid of explanation regarding how the items in the lock box are connected to criminal activity or what might be found inside the lock box. Thus, according to Appellant, the items taken from the lock box should be suppressed.\nThe Commonwealth asserts that the officers at Appellant\u2019s apartment vacated the premises after determining that there were no additional victims at the scene, and awaited the issuance of a warrant. The warrant provided for seizure of, inter alia, ammunition, photographs, records of ownership and occupancy, and any other forensic evidence which may be related to the case. It was reasonable, according to the Commonwealth, that the lock box located under Appellant\u2019s bed, near a fresh pool of blood, would contain any or all of the items listed above. Furthermore, the Commonwealth obtained a second search warrant for the contents of the lock box, which contained prescription bottles, a spoon with residue, a syringe, miscellaneous documents and IDs, a letter from Appellant\u2019s brother, Cory, and assorted coins. As noted above, the suppression court determined that, based upon the circumstances, a lawful security check was fully justified, permitting the officers to legally be in the residence without a search warrant. Thereafter, the police followed the proper procedures in obtaining a valid search warrant to seize, open, and search the lock box.\nWe find that Appellant has failed to establish that the search warrant obtained for the lock box was not supported by probable cause. As referenced above, the initial warrantless search was justified by the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Thereafter, the officers vacated the premises without seizing any items and waited for the issuance of a warrant. The warrant was properly issued. The lock box, lying near the pool of blood in Appellant\u2019s room and a bullet casing, was seized during the search of the residence pursuant to the warrant which permitted seizure of ammunition, photographs, records of ownership and occupancy, and other forensic evidence related to the case. Thus, we agree with the trial court and the Commonwealth that it was probable that evidence of the crime would be contained in the lock box located under Appellant\u2019s bed, near a fresh pool of blood and a bullet casing, and that it could contain certain of the items listed in the search warrant. Furthermore, as noted above, a second warrant was issued for the contents of the lock box. Thus, we believe that Appellant has failed to establish that the seizure of the lock box and its contents was improper.\nV. Jury Instruction on Voluntary Intoxication\nAppellant claims that the trial court improperly denied his requested jury instruction for voluntary intoxication. Appellant highlights Sergeant Griffith\u2019s testimony that Appellant appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of his arrest. Furthermore, Sergeant Griffith testified that Appellant was not moving when he was placed into Officer Hine\u2019s patrol car and that Appellant appeared to be asleep and had his eyes closed. In further support of his argument that he was intoxicated, Appellant emphasizes that he was driving a van that he did not own, without headlights, carrying a corpse, and that once he was in his holding cell, he dunked his hands in toilet water and washed them, even though a sink was available.\nThe Commonwealth responds that the trial court properly denied a jury instruction based upon voluntary intoxication. Specifically, the Commonwealth explains that the trial court properly found that there was no evidence that Appellant had actually consumed drugs or alcohol prior to the killing, or that he was overpowered or overwhelmed to such a degree that he was incapable of forming the intent to kill. In fact, Appellant\u2019s attempt to conceal the murder and dispose of Kolesnik\u2019s body suggested that he understood the nature, gravity, and consequences of his actions.\nIn order to be entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction, there must be some evidence that the defendant is overwhelmed or overpowered by alcohol or drugs to the point of losing his faculties or sensibilities. Commonwealth v. Tilley, 528 Pa. 125, 136, 595 A.2d 575, 580 (1991). Mere evidence of the consumption of alcohol or drugs and appearing intoxicated is not sufficient to support a conclusion that a defendant is overwhelmed or overpowered to be incapable of forming the requisite specific intent to kill. Id. Moreover, our standard of review when considering the denial of jury instructions is one of deference \u2014 an appellate court will reverse a court\u2019s decision only when it abused its discretion or committed an error of law. Commonwealth v. DeMarco, 570 Pa. 263, 271, 809 A.2d 256, 260-61 (2002).\nThe only evidence supporting Appellant\u2019s intoxication claim was the testimony of Sergeant Griffith, who stated that he believed Appellant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This was based upon Appellant\u2019s slow response to questioning. As noted by the trial court, none of the other officers who interacted with Appellant the night he was arrested believed that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Furthermore, Appellant had the presence of mind to remove Kolesnik\u2019s body from his residence, wrap and bind the victim\u2019s body, and drive the body toward a secluded wooded area, during which he attempted to elude capture. Rather than being overwhelmed, these actions strongly demonstrate an individual acting coherently and methodically. See Commonwealth v. Cuevas, 574 Pa. 409, 419-20, 832 A.2d 388, 394 (2003) (upholding denial of involuntary intoxication instruction, finding intoxication did not deprive defendant of understanding the importance of hiding his crime and himself). Additionally, while Appellant points to his dunking of his hands in a toilet to support his claim, this meager act is simply insufficient to show that Appellant was overwhelmed or overpowered by drugs or alcohol to the point of losing his faculties so as to require a charge of voluntary intoxication. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or commit legal error in refusing to charge the jury regarding voluntary intoxication.\nVI. Verdict Slip\nAppellant alleges that the trial court erred in accepting a verdict of death even though the verdict slip did not indicate the finding of any aggravating circumstances. Specifically, Appellant contends that the jury returned with a verdict of death after its deliberation, finding as an aggravating circumstance a \u201chistory of progressively more violent felonies.\u201d N.T., 8/13/07, at 77. After review of the verdict slip, the trial court instructed the jury that the circumstance they found was not a specific statutory factor under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711 and the jury was instructed to continue deliberations. The court pointed out the aggravating circumstance sought by the Commonwealth. The jury then returned a verdict of death citing Section 9711(d)(9). According to Appellant, the trial court prejudiced him when it \u201cin essence, forced the jury to find an aggravating factor that they had not initially found.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 50.\nThe Commonwealth retorts that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the aggravating circumstance sought by the Commonwealth, i.e., whether Appellant \u201chas a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d N.T., 8/13/07, at 68. According to the Commonwealth, once the jury came back with a finding of the aggravating circumstance regarding a history of progressively more violent felonies, the trial court called a sidebar at which the trial court expressed its belief that the appropriate way to resolve the problem was to \u201cpoint this out to the jurors and send them back upstairs.\u201d N.T., 8/13/07, at 79. Defense counsel responded, \u201cI would agree, Your Honor.\u201d Id. Thereafter, the trial court reinstructed the jurors that the aggravating factor listed on the verdict slip was not an aggravating factor under the law. The trial court went on to explain to the jury that they were excused for further deliberations as to whether or not they found a statutory aggravating circumstance:\nNow, I don\u2019t know and will not speculate as to what was meant by the aggravating circumstance that you have listed here. I can only tell you that, as stated, it is not an aggravating circumstance under Pennsylvania law. Therefore, I am not going to record this verdict as stated. What I\u2019m going to do instead is I\u2019m going to excuse you to return to the jury deliberations room and determine through further deliberations \u2014 you should determine through further deliberations whether or not you have found a statutory aggravating circumstance. And the instructions that I gave you previously about what you should do if you find one apply. And what you should do if you do not find one apply as well as the instructions on the verdict slip itself.\nN.T., 8/13/07, at 81. Thus, the Commonwealth argues that, as defense counsel never objected to the trial court\u2019s decision to reinstruct the jury on the proper aggravating circumstance and to return them to deliberate, but concurred with this approach, counsel cannot now claim trial error.\nBased upon the above, we find that, by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s decision to reinstruct the jury or to the jury instruction, the issue as couched has been waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302. Moreover, even a cursory review of the record reveals that the trial court did not order the jury to find a statutory aggravator, but, rather, invited the jury to deliberate further and determine whether or not they found a permissible statutory aggravator. Thus, Appellant is not entitled to relief.\nVII. Examination of Expert Through Use of Hypothetical Questions\nNext, Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit trial counsel to ask hypothetical questions of its expert witness, because the court concluded the record did not support such questions. Appellant contends that, because there was record support for such questions, the trial court\u2019s denial of these questions was improper. The exchange at trial reveals that Appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to ask Dr. Shane hypothetical questions regarding Kolesnik\u2019s alleged overdose from heroin and his time spent in rehabilitation.\nBY MR. WELSH [Appellant\u2019s counsel]\nQ: Doctor, I\u2019ll give you some hypotheticals, if I may.\nDoctor, assume that the deceased, Kristofer Kolesnik, had a long history of heroin addiction, would that be significant in helping you formulate an opinion as to manner of death?\nA [Dr. Shane]: The answer is yes or no. And he would certainly require higher dosages for a high, but certainly, his central nervous system and respiratory centers would be in stress and depressed. And failed opiates would not be\u2014 in terms of high levels of respiratory tolerances that we see in other drugs\u2014\nQ: Let me ask you this, assume that Kristofer Kolesnik overdosed from heroin, but survived, would that be significant in helping you in forming an opinion as to the manner of death\u2014\nMR. BALDWIN [District Attorney]: Objection, Your Hon- or\nTHE COURT: Objection sustained\nBY MR. WELSH: Q Doctor, assume that Kristofer Kolesnik received treatment in five (5) rehabs and then after the last rehab, which would have been in November- \u2014 -actually December \u2014 November of 2005, would that be significant\u2014 and thereafter got back on heroin\u2014\nMR. WELSH: \u2014would that be significant in helping you form an opinion as to the manner of death?\nMR. BALDWIN: Again, same objection, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: The objection is sustained.\nN.T., 8/9/07, at 688-89.\nAppellant maintains Hess testified that Kolesnik overdosed on heroin sometime in early 2006 at the A-Plus minimarket located on Perkiomen Avenue. Appellant avers that, because Hess\u2019 testimony establishes that the victim overdosed in 2006, the court erred in denying Dr. Shane the ability to answer that question. Hess also offered that the victim had a lengthy history of heroin addictions and had spent time on five different occasions at rehabilitation facilities. Again, Appellant submits that the facts underlying this question are in the record as Hess testified that the victim had been in five rehabilitation facilities and that he overdosed on heroin in 2006. In further support of his argument, Appellant points to Dr. Shane\u2019s testimony that the amount of opiates in the victim\u2019s system were so elevated that they constituted a suicide attempt by overdosing on opiates. Dr. Shane also opined that the victim was attempting suicide by either overdose of heroin or a gunshot wound to the head.\nThe Commonwealth disputes the basis for Appellant\u2019s argument by responding that there was not competent evidence in the record establishing that Kolesnik had overdosed. While Hess was questioned whether Kolesnik had overdosed previously, she testified only: \u201cHe told me that happened. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d N.T., 8/8/07, at 518. There was no other testimony introduced at trial establishing that an overdose had, in fact, occurred. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the trial court acted within its discretion in precluding the hypothetical question. Similarly, the Commonwealth acknowledges that, with respect to the hypothetical regarding Kolesnik\u2019s rehabilitation efforts, Hess testified that Kolesnik had been in 5 rehabilitation facilities, but always relapsed. Furthermore, Appellant\u2019s brother, Cory Galvin, explained that Kolesnik had expressed desperation over being thrown out of rehabilitation and was unable to lack his heroin addiction. Yet, according to the Commonwealth, the trial court acted within its discretion when it concluded there was insufficient evidence to support any assumptions regarding the time the victim spent in rehabilitation. As the trial court explained, \u201csuch details like the length of Kolesnick\u2019s [sic] time in treatment, the nature of his treatment, and the reasons for being kicked out of rehab would be relevant and likely necessary for Dr. Shane to offer a competent, permissible opinion about the effect, if any, of Kolesnick\u2019s [sic] time in rehab.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/13/08, at 27. Thus, the Commonwealth submits that Appellant is not entitled to relief.\nThe use of hypothetical questions is proper when there is evidence of record supporting the hypothetical. Commonwealth v. Petrovich, 538 Pa. 369, 372, 648 A.2d 771, 772 (1994) (expert may give his opinion in response to a hypothetical if the set of facts assumed in the hypothetical is supported by competent evidence). An expert, however, may not base an opinion on conjecture or guesswork. Id. Moreover, the admissibility of expert testimony is vested within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned unless the trial court commits an abuse of that discretion. Id.\nWe believe the trial court properly resolved this issue. Without a sufficient basis in the record, a hypothetical question based upon incompetent testimony is improper. Here, the trial court noted that Appellant failed to offer competent evidence to establish that the victim overdosed. Furthermore, there was a dearth of specific information regarding the alleged overdose, such as when the overdose occurred, what caused the overdose, or any of the ramifications of the overdose. Thus, Appellant failed to make a preliminary showing-sufficient to permit the hypothetical question regarding Kolesnik\u2019s alleged overdose. As there was insufficient evidence in the record concerning the victim\u2019s overdosing, hypothetical questions based upon such an assertion were properly denied.\nFurthermore, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the hypothetical questions based upon Kolesnik\u2019s time at a rehabilitation facility. The trial court properly opined that, while there was some evidence that the victim spent time in a rehabilitation facility, there was insufficient testimony regarding the circumstances of the victim\u2019s treatment in rehabilitation to permit Dr. Shane to offer a competent permissible opinion about the effect, if any, of Kolesnik\u2019s time in rehabilitation. Thus, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the hypothetical questions based upon such treatment.\nVIII. Use of Common Practice Questions\nFinally, Appellant complains that the trial court improperly denied his brother, Cory Galvin, the opportunity to testify at trial regarding the common practice of Appellant and others while in Appellant\u2019s apartment regarding heroin use. Specifically, Galvin would have testified that he had known Kolesnik for over 10 years; that he, the victim, and Appellant were friends; and that they had used heroin with each other on some occasions. According to Appellant, the testimony of his brother established a pattern or habit of individuals using heroin in Appellant\u2019s apartment, which would have supported his theory that Kolesnik died alone in Appellant\u2019s apartment as a result of suicide.\nThe Commonwealth responds that, at the time such testimony was elicited, the Commonwealth objected, and defense counsel specifically acknowledged that the testimony was not being introduced to establish a common practice or habit:\nTHE COURT: I have another question. Where is this going? The decedent\u2019s drug use has been well established, as has the defendant\u2019s drug use and this witness\u2019s drug use, what is the import of this testimony.\nMR. WELSH: The question is that this was a drug house where [Appellant] would go get drugs and the others would stay alone in the room while he obtained the drugs\u2014\nMR. BALDWIN: I object to that because the question is what happened on January 31st \u2014 January 30th and 31st. This witness was locked up, he doesn\u2019t know.\nMR. WELSH: It wasn\u2019t any different in November or October when he wasn\u2019t locked up than when he was locked up.\nTHE COURT: Is it your contention that there was a practice that may have existed prior to this guy\u2019s incarceration that you can establish what happened in January through the use of that?\nMR WELSH: No, we have other witnesses for January.\nN.T., 8/9/07, at 698-699. Therefore, the Commonwealth emphasizes that trial counsel specifically denied that the purpose of the testimony was to establish a continuing course of behavior that would establish a common practice. Thus, the Commonwealth stresses that Appellant cannot now claim trial court error when trial counsel failed to seek admission of the testimony on the basis now asserted.\nBased upon the above testimony, the trial court determined, inter alia, that Appellant was not attempting to establish a routine practice through the testimony of his brother. Appellant stated that other witnesses would establish that routine during the relevant time. Furthermore the court concluded that, even if Appellant had tried to establish a habit through his brother, drug use in a person\u2019s house is not the type of habit or routine that would be admissible under the rules of evidence. Thus, the court rejected this claim.\nPennsylvania Rule of Evidence 406 establishes that evidence of the habit of a person or a routine practice is relevant to establish that the conduct of a person on a particular occasion was consistent with such habit.\nEvidence of the habit of a person or of routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.\nPa.R.E. 406.\nAdmission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned unless the trial court commits an abuse of that discretion. Commonwealth v. Minerd, 562 Pa. 46, 54, 753 A.2d 225, 229 (2000). One must object, however, to the particular basis on which to admit or deny such evidence. Commonwealth v. Scarborough, 491 Pa. 300, 319, 421 A.2d 147, 156 (1980); Pa.R.A.P. 302. We agree with the Commonwealth that the basis on which Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the evidence of a purported habit or routine practice was not offered as a basis for the admission of the evidence by trial counsel during the hearing. Thus, the trial court properly rejected Appellant\u2019s argument.\nIX. Statutory Review of Death Penalty Verdict\nHaving reviewed all of Appellant\u2019s claims, we conclude that relief is not warranted. Accordingly, this Court must affirm the sentence of death unless we determine that it was a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(i). After careful review of the record, we find that the sentence of death was not a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but was based upon the evidence admitted at trial. Further, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(h), we determine that the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstance the jury found in imposing a sentence of death. Lastly, this sentence complies with 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv), which mandates a sentence of death when the factfinder finds one or more aggravating circumstances that outweigh any mitigating circumstances.\nAccordingly, we affirm the verdict and sentence of death imposed upon Appellant by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER, McCAFFERY and GREENSPAN join the opinion.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5510.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4910(1).\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3925(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3928(a).\n. 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3734.\n. 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4302(a)(1).\n. Cumru Township provides police protection to the Borough of Kenhorst, which does not have its own police department.\n. Michael Miller, who lived in the apartment above Appellant, was charged in connection with the disposition of Kolesnik's body. Evidently, Appellant asked for Miller's assistance in moving a \"heavy object\u201d into the van. Suppression Court Opinion at 8. Miller helped Appellant slide the body into the van. Id.\n. No gun was ever recovered related to Kolesnik's murder.\n. We have jurisdiction over the direct appeal from a judgment of a sentence of death pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(4) and \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\n. For clarity, we have reordered Lite issues Appellant raises on appeal.\n. Appellant\u2019s dismay over his brother\u2019s incarceration was part of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory advanced at trial, but is not developed further for purposes of this appeal.\n. While Appellant cites to both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution in support of his argument, he fails to offer any argument that the analysis of the issue is distinct under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Therefore, we consider his claim for relief only under our federal charter.\n. Appellant also suggests that the police violated the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule. Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 403, 598 A.2d 539 (1991). The trial court found this issue to be waived as Appellant failed to properly raise the issue in his Omnibus Pretrial Motion and did not take testimony on this issue at either of two suppression hearings. As Appellant does not address the trial court's finding of waiver, and fails to develop this argument in any meaningful fashion in his brief before us, we find that he has waived this issue for purposes of appellate review. Pa.R.A.P. 302.\n. \"The defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9).\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit a complete record of this case to the Governor in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(i).",
