        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nPursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Borough Code \u00a7 1001, the Phoenixville Borough Council enacted an ordinance eliminating compensation for its councilmembers and mayors, effective immediately. Appellant, a councilman who voted against the ordinance, sought a declaratory judgment invalidating it, contending it altered councilmembers\u2019 compensation mid-term, in violation of Pennsylvania Constitution Article III, \u00a7 27.\nThe trial court, relying on Baldwin v. City of Philadelphia, 99 Pa. 164 (1881), determined the Phoenixville ordinance was not a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article III, \u00a7 27, and dismissed appellant\u2019s action. The Commonwealth Court affirmed, finding it was bound by Baldwin\u2019s holding that an ordinance is not a law within the meaning of Article III, \u00a7 27. Buckwalter v. Borough of Phoenixville, 940 A.2d 617, 624 n. 17 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). The court noted it could not disregard the binding precedent of Baldwin and its progeny, though it invited this Court to reconsider Baldwin.\nWe granted allocatur to indeed reexamine Baldwin, and determine whether Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 27 prohibits midterm compensation changes for elected municipal officers by means of a municipal ordinance. These are purely legal questions; thus, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006). In constitutional interpretation, \u201c \u2018[o]ur ultimate touchstone is the actual language of the constitution itself.\u2019 \u201d Jubelirer v. Rendell, 598 Pa. 16, 953 A.2d 514, 528 (2008) (quoting Stilp v. Commonwealth, 588 Pa. 539, 905 A.2d 918, 939 (2006) (citations omitted)). We interpret constitutional language as the average person would understand it when they voted on its adoption, and avoid stx-ained or technical interpretations. Id.\nBaldwin is precedential, and Pennsylvania follows the doctrine of stare decisis, which \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal piinciples, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d Stilp, at 954 n. 31 (quoting Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 244, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (citations omitted)). However, \u201cstare decisis is not a vehicle for perpetuating error, but rather a legal concept which responds to the demands of justice and, thus, permits the orderly growth processes of the law to flourish.\u201d Estate of Grossman, 486 Pa. 460, 406 A.2d 726, 731 (1979) (quoting Ayala v. Philadelphia Board of Public Education, 453 Pa. 584, 305 A.2d 877, 888 (1973)).\nAppellant contends Baldwin utilized a strained, technical interpx'etation of the word \u201claw.\u201d He claims a \u201claw\u201d is a rule governing a community regardless of its source, and argues Article III, \u00a7 27 is a substantive restriction, limiting the subject matter of legislation enacted by any entity in the Comxnonwealth. Appellant notes this Court has applied other sections of Article III to xnunicipalities, and argues we should do the same with \u00a7 27. Appellant contends that as all municipalities derive their power from the Legislature, if the Legislarme does not have the power to diminish salaries mid-term, it cannot delegate power to do so to municipalities.\nAppellee counters that Baldwin was correctly decided, as at the time there was a national consensus that limited the word \u201claw\u201d to legislative acts. See, e.g., State v. Lee, 29 Minn. 445, 13 N.W. 913, 914 (1882) (violations of municipal \u201cby-laws\u201d are distinct from Legislature\u2019s laws for double jeopardy purposes), abrogation recognized by Miles v. State, 349 Md. 215, 707 A.2d 841, 847 (1998) (\u201cThe earlier view that state offenses and locally enacted offenses are treated as separate and distinct has been modified, because of double jeopardy principles ...\u201d); Meredith v. Whillock, 173 Mo.App. 542, 158 S.W. 1061, 1064 (1913) (ordinance is not law); Mayor of Rutherford v. Swink, 96 Tenn. 564, 35 S.W. 554, 555 (1896) (\u201cIt is manifest that a municipal ordinance is not a statute ... \u201d). Appellee contends Baldivin was consistent with this consensus. Appellee asserts prohibiting municipalities from addressing compensation mid-term would eliminate the flexibility necessary for municipal governance. Finally, because \u00a7 1001 of the Borough Code was enacted in reliance on Bcddivin, appellee claims overruling Baldwin would cast doubt on \u00a7 1001\u2019s constitutionality.\nConfining the term \u201claw\u201d in Article III, \u00a7 27 to enactments of the \u201csupreme power,\u201d the Legislature, comports with Blackstone and his commentaries on English Law; while a worthy source, a more appropriate and ordinarily understood definition of \u201claw\u201d is \u201c[t]he regime that orders human activities and relations through systematic application of the force of politically organized society, or through social pressure, backed by force, in such society.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 900 (8th ed. 2004). This definition recognizes that the law comes from various legitimate sources and is not limited to direct enactments of the Legislature. For example, Black\u2019s describes an ordinance as \u201cauthoritative law or decree; esp. a municipal regulation .... [i]t is a legislative enactment, within its sphere, as much as an act of the state legislature.\u201d Id., at 1132 (quoting 1 Judith O\u2019Gallagher, Municipal Ordinances \u00a7 1A.01, at 3 (2d ed. 1998)).\nEven at the time of Bcddivin, \u201claw\u201d was understood to include more than a legislature\u2019s enactments. See 2 John Bouvier, A Law Dictionai-y 12 (14th ed. Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott & Co. 1874) (definition of law includes \u201crules and methods by which society compels and restrains its members\u201d). Municipal ordinances were understood even then to be laws. See id., at 263 (ordinance is \u201c[a] law, a statute, a decree\u201d). It is fair to argue that as Article III of our Constitution establishes and limits the Legislature, it must, when it speaks of \u201claw,\u201d refer to something done by that body; Baldwin does have some salient logic. However, it is also logical to believe the term includes derivative pronouncements of bodies authorized and empowered by the Legislature, acts by bodies other than the Legislature itself. With the latter notion, we agree. We conclude \u201claw\u201d in Article III, \u00a7 27 is not limited to legislative enactments; an ordinance is understood to be a law, and Baldwin\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is unsound.\nBorough Code \u00a7 1001, which permits a borough to set compensation for its councilmembers, is a provision enacted by the Legislature. Furthermore, \u201cmunicipal corporations are creatures of the State and ... the authority of the Legislature over their powers is supreme. Municipal corporations have no inherent powers and may do only those things which the Legislature has expressly or by necessary implication placed within their power to do.\u201d Denbow v. Borough of Leetsdale, 556 Pa. 567, 729 A.2d 1113, 1118 (1999) (citations omitted). Thus, every municipal ordinance emanates from the Legislature because it was enacted pursuant to enabling legislation.\nAs appellant notes, this Court has applied other provisions of Article III to municipalities. In Lighton v. Abington Township, 336 Pa. 345, 9 A.2d 609 (1939), a township proposal to issue bonds to construct a sewer system permitted bondholders to take control of the system if the township defaulted. Id., at 610-12. Taxpayers argued the proposed bonds violated Article III, \u00a7 20 (now \u00a7 31). Id., at 612. Enjoining the bond issuance, we held \u201cthe township, as the governmental agent of the state, is subject to the same prohibition to which the state is subject.\u201d Id.\nWe also applied the restriction set forth in Article III, \u00a7 29 (then \u00a7 18) to a municipality. In Schade v. Allegheny County Institution District, 386 Pa. 507, 126 A.2d 911 (1956), taxpayers sued to prevent the Allegheny County Institution District from spending its funds to support delinquent, neglected, or dependent children who had been placed in religious facilities. Id., at 912. Noting the District was a product of the Legislature, we applied Article III, \u00a7 18 (now \u00a7 29), reasoning:\nIt would be strange, indeed, if the legislature by creating a body politic or corporate to exercise a legislative function could do indirectly what it may not do directly. It seems too plain for cavil that, if a mere creature of the legislature can do what the legislature itself is constitutionally prohibited from doing, the carefully designed [constitutional] prohibition ... could be rendered useless. Such a result is not to be sanctioned.\nId., at 913.\nMore recently, a borough council increased the pay of police officers who were subject to a collective bargaining agreement which did not provide for alteration of wages during the agreement\u2019s duration. Denbow, at 1113-14. The borough subsequently refused to pay this extra compensation, claiming it violated Article III, \u00a7 26, and the officers filed suit. Id., at 1114. This Court reasoned that as the Constitution prohibited the Legislature from effecting a pay increase, the borough \u201cshould be likewise constrained.\u201d Id., at 1118. We invalidated the pay increases and distinguished the Baldwin line of cases by noting Article III, \u00a7 26 had already been applied to municipalities. Id., at 1115-16.\nThese cases highlight Baldwin\u2019s continuing untenability. Article III, \u00a7 27\u2019s limitation is meaningless if the Legislature can circumvent it by authorizing municipalities to enact the mid-term compensation changes the Legislature itself may not enact. This would be incongruous, as \u201c[t]he [Legislature, in turn, may delegate or grant only those powers which are constitutionally permitted.\u201d Denbow, at 1118 (citing Cleaver v. Board of Adjustment of Tredyffrin Township, 414 Pa. 367, 200 A.2d 408, 412 (1964)). We have determined Baldwin\u2019s construction of \u201claw\u201d as including only legislative enactments was erroneous. This Court has applied other provisions of Article III to municipalities, showing the restrictions of Article III can extend to municipalities. We overrule Baldwin insofar as it held Article III, \u00a7 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution does not apply to municipal ordinances.\nIt is well-settled the Legislature may not alter, midterm, the compensation of incumbent elected officials during their current terms. Bakes v. Snyder, 486 Pa. 80, 403 A.2d 1307, 1309 (1979) (Article III, \u00a7 27 prohibited statute providing for \u201cimmediate\u201d pay increases for county officers). Because the Legislature lacks the power to make mid-term changes to the compensation of public officials, it cannot give such a power to municipalities. See Denbow, at 1118. Therefore, the Phoenixville Borough Council lacked the authority to change its councilmemb\u00e9rs\u2019 pay during incumbent council-members\u2019 terms.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and GREENSPAN join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. Section \u00a7 1001 provides \u201ccouncilmen may receive compensation to be fixed by ordinance at any time and from time to time....\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 46001.\n. Article III, \u00a7 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides \u201c[n]o law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.\" Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 27.\n. In Baldwin, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance reducing a city official's salary during his term. This Court upheld the ordinance, holding only legislative enactments were within the meaning of \"law.\u201d Baldwin, at 170-71. Relying on William Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the Laws of England, the Court defined a law as \"an emanation from the supreme power, [which] cannot originate elsewhere. It is a rule which every citizen of the state is bound to obey.\" Id., at 170. The Court found the Legislature was the supreme power in Pennsylvania; an ordinance was merely a local regulation, binding only people in its community. Id. The Court reasoned as Article III limited the powers of the Legislature, it should only apply to the Legislature. Id.\n. Our courts have consistently followed Baldwin, as the constitutional language remains unchanged; however, we have not revisited the reasoning of the decision in the 128 years since its pronouncement. See, e.g., McKinley v. School District of Luzerne Township, 383 Pa. 289, 118 A.2d 137, 139 (1955) (Article III, \u00a7 27 \u201capplies only to a law, which means an act of the Legislature, and not to action by any municipal or local authority\u201d) (emphasis in original); Merwine v. County of Monroe, 141 Pa. 162, 21 A. 509, 512 (1891) (per curiam ) (upholding County Commissioners altering compensation for county officers); Crawford County v. Nash, 99 Pa. 253, 260 (1882) (noting Baldwin excluded municipal ordinances from the term \"law\u201d in Article III, \u00a7 27); Belitskus v. Stratton, 830 A.2d 610, 615 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) (applying Baldwin to allow pay increases for elected county officials); Murphy v. Bradley, 113 Pa.Cmwlth. 387, 537 A.2d 917, 920 (1988) (relying on Baldwin to determine judicial order was not law within Article III, \u00a7 27's meaning); Sefler v. Borough of McKees Rocks, 72 Pa.Super. 81, 87 (1919) (per curiam) (noting only Legislature may alter officials' pay mid-term); Davis v. Homestead Borough, 47 Pa.Super. 444, 446-47 (1911) (ordinance providing salary in lieu of expenses for borough officer was not law).\n. At the time, Article III, \u00a7 20 provided: \"The General Assembly shall not delegate to any special commission, private corporation or association, any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects, whether held in trust or otherwise, or to levy taxes or perform any municipal functions whatever.\u201d Former Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 20.\n. This section, at the time, provided: \"No appropriations, except for pensions or gratuities for military services, shall be made for charitable, educational or benevolent purposes, to any person or community, nor to any denomination or sectarian institution, corporation or association.\u201d Former Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 18.\n. This section provides:\nNo bill shall be passed giving any extra compensation to any public officer, servant, employe, agent or contractor, after services shall have been rendered or contract made, nor providing for the payment of any claim against the Commonwealth without previous authority of law....\nPa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 26.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nInitially, the majority opinion indicates that Pennsylvania courts have consistently followed Baldwin v. City of Philadelphia, 99 Pa. 164 (1881). See Majority Opinion, at 537 n. 4, 985 A.2d at 730 n. 4. Later in the opinion, however, the majority discusses a series of Article III cases exhibiting strong tension with Baldwin\u2019s core rationale. See id. at 539-42, 985 A.2d at 732-33.\nAs ably advanced by Appellee, there have always been strong historical and contextual arguments to be made that the term \u201claw,\u201d as used in Article III, refers only to enactments by the General Assembly. Thus, I find this to be a very difficult setting in which to apply the exception to stare decisis pertaining to manifestly erroneous decisions. Rather, I believe the Court is in a position of reconciling two inconsistent, but both reasoned, lines of decisions, and that the present outcome is most consistent with this Court\u2019s modern Article III jurisprudence and the salutary policies underlying the constitutional prescriptions.\n. Appellee validly notes that Baldwin mirrors the position taken by a number of other courts at or near the time of its issuance. See Brief for Appellee at 3-6 (citing State v. Lee, 29 Minn. 445, 13 N.W. 913, 914 (1882) (\"The terms \u2018by-law,\u2019 'ordinance,' and \u2018municipal regulation' have substantially the same meaning, and are defined 'to be the laws of the corporate district, made by the authorized body, in distinction from the general law of the state.' \u201d); Town of Rutherford v. Swink, 96 Tenn. 564, 35 S.W. 554, 555 (1896) (same); United States v. Cella, 37 App.D.C. 433, 435 (D.C.Cir.1911) (\u201cWhile municipal ordinances or police regulations are binding upon the community affected by them, they do not emanate from the supreme power of the state, which is the exclusive source of all general legislation.\u201d); Meredith v. Whillock, 173 Mo.App. 542, 158 S.W. 1061, 1064 (1913) (\"That a city ordinance is not law is obvious. An ordinance is defined to be 'a rule or regulation adopted by a municipal corporation.' \" (emphasis removed and citation omitted)); Maner v. Dykes, 183 Ga. 118, 187 S.E. 699, 702 (1936) (determining that the word \u201claw\u201d used in a constitutional amendment referred to enactments by the General Assembly)). See also Fennell v. Common Council of Bay City, 36 Mich. 186, 190, 1877 WL 3736, *3 (1877) (\"The term law, as defined by the elementary writers, emanates from the sovereignty and not from its creatures. The legislative power of the state is vested in the state legislature, and their enactments are the only instruments that can in any proper sense be called laws.\u201d (emphasis removed)).",
