The Majority’s interpretation of the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, 53 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2901-3171 (“Home Rule Law”), and its conclusion that a municipality that adopts home rule may not regulate business in any fashion, leads to a result that is both unreasonable and <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>in direct conflict with the General Assembly’s manifest intent to give home rule municipalities greater power than if they had opted for other forms of government. Indeed, after today’s decision, municipalities which have adopted home rule now possess less power than non-home rule municipalities. Moreover, the Majority’s zero-regulation interpretation will open a Pandora’s Box of challenges to numerous ordinances currently on the books which regulate, to one degree or another, local business in home rule municipalities. Finally, the Majority’s reconciliation of its approach today with the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Hartman v. City of Allentown, </em><a href="/a2d/880/0737-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="880 A.2d 737" data-case-ids="8939290" data-case-paths="/a2d/880/0737-01">880 A.2d 737</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2005), which upheld an anti-discrimination ordinance in light of a similar challenge, simply cannot be sustained by the Majority’s own statutory interpretation construct. Instead of using the same plain language approach to strike the Protection of Displaced Contract Workers Ordinance, the Majority, in its attempt to harmonize its decision today with <em>Hartman, </em>engrafts onto the statute a distinction between affirmative and non-affirmative duties that is not found there, and that is impossible to reconcile with the plain language of the statute. In doing so, the Majority overlooks a more nuanced approach which prohibits home rule municipalities from determining duties already imposed by the legislature, but does not bar all regulation of businesses and employers.</p>

Indeed, this function is so paramount that “[i]n the construction of the statutes of the Commonwealth, the rules set forth in [the Statutory Construction Act] shall be observed, unless the application of such rules would result in a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>§ 1901. Furthermore, while statutory language that is free from all ambiguity must be regarded, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b), certain presumptions are simultaneously in operation, aiding our understanding of the General Assembly’s intent. Specifically, we presume that the General Assembly did not intend a result that is unreasonable, absurd, or impossible of execution. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1). Additionally, we accept that the legislature intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(5). Finally, and specific to the issue before us, the legislature itself has mandated that home rule municipal powers are to be “liberally construed in favor of the municipality.” 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 2961. Thus, it is with the full panoply of tools of statutory construction that the Court discerns the intent of the General Assembly.</p>

The Majority simply looks to “the plain language of the statute and our review of prior case law” to conclude that the Home Rule Law prohibits home rule municipalities from any regulation of businesses or employers. Majority Opinion at 510, 985 A.2d at 714.

Under this interpretation of Section 2962(f), home rule municipalities are prohibited from determining duties which have already been imposed by the legislature; they are not barred from all regulation of businesses and employers. This less sweeping interpretation of Section 2962(f) gives life to both the <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>statutory language and the intent of the General Assembly in granting home rule municipalities greater powers than non-home rule entities.

    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[298,667,1155,1045]]]'>This approach is further supported by other subsections of the Home Rule Law which make concrete that the General Assembly did not intend a total ban on the regulation of businesses and employers because the legislature knew how to expressly prohibit home rule municipalities from acting. For example, with respect to the regulation of firearms, a municipality’s power is clear: “A municipality shall not enact any ordinance or take any other action dealing with the regulation of the transfer, ownership, transportation or possession of firearms.” 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 2962(g). Likewise, Section 2962(c)(5) provides that a municipality shall not “[e]nact any provision inconsistent with any statute heretofore enacted prior to April 13, 1972, affecting the rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision of this Commonwealth.” 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 2962(c)(5).

While using a plain language approach to declare the ordinance before us invalid, the Majority then embraces the <em>Hartman </em>court’s finding that the statute only forbids home rule municipalities from placing “affirmative duties” on businesses and employers. The plain language of the statute, however, makes no such distinction between affirmative and non-affirmative duties. Thus, contrary to its earlier approach, the Majority <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>reads into the statute a distinction between affirmative and non-affirmative duties that simply is not there.</p>

[t]his is plainly a ‘requirement’ placed upon the new contractor.” Majority Opinion at 510, 985 A.2d at 714. Inserting into this analysis the anti-discrimination ordinance at issue in <em>Hartman, </em>yields “Allentown’s Ordinance nonetheless purports to prohibit a business from denying housing because of an individual’s sexual orientation ... [t]his is plainly a requirement placed upon a business.” This simple overlay of analysis makes manifest both the illusory distinction between affirmative and non-affirmative duties, as well as the inharmonious reading of the Majority’s initial plain language approach and that taken by the Commonwealth Court in <em>Hartman. </em>Simply stated, the Home Rule Law, by its terms, makes no distinction between affirmative and non-affirmative duties and the <em>Hartman </em>court’s approach and the plain language construct employed by the Majority in this ease are incongruous.</p>
