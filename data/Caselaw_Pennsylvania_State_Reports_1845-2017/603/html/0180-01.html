      <em>BACKGROUND</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[130,679,1155,752]]]'>Spectrum owns and operates a sports and entertainment facility known as the Wachovia Center Complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the “Wachovia Center”). From April 11, 2000 through May 1, 2003 "(the “Refund Period”) Spectrum used a significant amount of electricity to heat, cool, and light the Wachovia Center. During the Refund Period and until May 29, 2003, the electricity for the Wachovia Center was generated by Exelon Energy (“Exelon”) and delivered by PECO Energy Company (“PECO”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> During the Refund Period PECO charged Spectrum for electricity generation, transmission services, distribution services, competitive transition charges (“CT Charges”), and intangible transition charges (“IT Charges”). Spectrum was charged and paid state and local sales tax on all of the aforementioned charges.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[128,1471,1155,531]]]'>However, Spectrum disputed its obligation to pay sales tax on the transmission services, distribution services, CT Charges, and IT Charges (collectively the “Disputed Charges”). On April 11, 2003, Spectrum filed with the Department of Revenue Board of Appeals (the “Board”) a petition for a refund of sales tax paid on the Disputed Charges during the Refund Period. In its petition, Spectrum argued that non-generation costs did not constitute a taxable sale of tangible personal property or a specifically enumerated taxable service as defined by the Tax Code.</p>
    <p id="b296-3" data-blocks='[["BL_296.3",296,[292,337,1149,360]]]'>
      <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>The Board denied Spectrum’s petition and found that the Disputed Charges were part of the “sale of electricity” and therefore subject to sales tax. As a basis for this finding, the Board relied on a Department of Revenue Policy Statement (the “Policy Statement”) contained in Section 60.23 of the Pennsylvania Administrative Code. Pursuant to the Policy Statement, sales tax is to be assessed:</p>
    <blockquote id="AkG" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[333,713,1108,405]]]'>upon the total purchase price charged upon each separate charge for the generation, transmission, or distribution in connection with providing nonresidential electric utility services as well as all related charges, services or costs for the generation, production, transmission, or distribution of electricity whether or not the total amount charged is billed as a single charge by one vendor or billed separately by one or more vendors.</blockquote>

    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[292,1367,1150,671]]]'>Spectrum filed a timely appeal with the Commonwealth Court.

In its exceptions Spectrum argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that an exemption in the Tax Code applied to the Disputed Charges.

Spectrum argues that the taxable “sale” of electricity was complete when Exelon delivered the electricity to PECO and any services provided thereafter by PECO to deliver the electricity do not constitute a taxable “sale.” Spectrum, in essence, equates mere generation with a completed sale.

The Commonwealth notes that prior to the Competition Act, a “sale” of electricity included both generation and delivery. Because the legislature did not specifically amend the definition of a “sale” to exclude delivery, the Commonwealth argues that the definition of a “sale” remains unchanged under the Competition Act. The Commonwealth argues that the taxable “sale” of electricity to Spectrum therefore includes both the generation of electricity by Exelon and the delivery of that electricity by PECO.</p>

The “total value” of the electricity purchased by Spectrum was not just the cost of the generation of the electricity but all the costs required for the energy to power the Wachovia Center. Spectrum’s argumexxt to the contrax-y is not consistent with the reality of electricity sales. The raw electricity generated by Exelon is not an end consumer product. Exelon has no practical means of delivering the electricity to Spectrum on its own. Spectrum cannot itself retrieve the electricity from Exelon. The electricity simply is not a finished product, capable of sale at retail, until it is both generated and delivered to the consumer. A sale at retail does not occur until the electricity reaches the consumer and it cannot be said to have occurred once Exelon transmits electricity to PECO. The definition of a sale at retail was applicable prior to the enactment of the Competition Act and the language of the Competition Act does not alter that definition.</p>

To the contrary, the legislature simply provided a means whereby two companies together could take steps to create one sale. The desire to increase competition in the marketplace changed nothing about the fundamental mechanics of the actual sale of electricity.

The CT Charges and IT Charges relate to the power lines and other infrastructure required to transmit electricity to the Wachovia Center.

Spectrum fails to articulate why it should not be required to pay tax on electricity delivery when the Commonwealth’s Department of Revenue has specifically called for electricity delivery charges to be subject to sales tax in the clear language of the Policy Statement. Although the disparate treatment of electricity and natural gas may seem illogical to Spectrum, it apparently is the scheme intended by the legislature. It is not within this Court’s power to alter this scheme and the impact of any inconsistency is more properly addressed directly to the legislature. <em>See Martin v.

As is discussed in greater detail herein, Spectrum shopped competitively among electricity companies and selected Exelon to generate energy for the Wachovia Center. Because the Wachovia Center is located in an area serviced by PECO as its local utility, Exelon does not own the necessary infrastructure needed to transmit the energy directly to Spectrum. Instead, Exelon generated the energy and transmitted that energy to PECO. PECO then transmitted that energy, as well as any surplus energy required by Spectrum, to the Wachovia Center <em>via </em>the electric lines and other infrastructure owned by PECO.</p>

Regardless of the origin of electricity, it must eventually pass through the power lines of a local utility to reach a consumer. Typical consumers in Pennsylvania reside or work in buildings connected to a single set of power lines that were built and are owned by that consumer's local utility. It would be cost prohibitive for other utility companies to build their own power lines to connect to each consumer. Instead, a utility that generates but does not deliver electricity, such as Exelon here, will transmit the generated electricity to the local utility. The local utility will then transmit the electricity along the power lines to the consumer. Here, the Wachovia Center was connected only to PECO's power lines. Unless Exelon built its own power lines, Exelon had to transmit electricity to PECO in order for the electricity to reach the Wachovia Center.</p>

In an effort to ensure that a utility was adequately compensated for the infrastructure it installed prior to the passage of the Competition Act which ended its monopoly, the General Assembly provided in the Public Utility Code that a utility may charge customers in its local area for CT Charges and IT Charges for a period of up to nine years, even if that customer does not purchase electricity from the utility in that time period. 66 Pa.C.S. § 2808(a)-(b).</p>
