As will be discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>in <em>Ohio Casualty, </em>an insurer brought an action against the CAT Fund in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction asserting that the CAT Fund was statutorily obligated to contribute to a medical malpractice settlement. The CAT Fund argued that the insurer first had to seek resolution of its coverage claim through an administrative process before the CAT Fund itself. We rejected the CAT Fund’s argument, and held that because the Malpractice Act did not contain a procedure which could afford the insurer the remedy it sought, the available administrative remedies were not adequate to resolve the coverage dispute, and the Commonwealth Court, therefore, had original jurisdiction over claims against the CAT Fund.</p>

Specifically, although the Commonwealth Court had original jurisdiction over actions for recovery against the CAT Fund pursuant to our decision in <em>Ohio Casualty, </em><a href="/pa/514/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="514 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="1804522" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0430-01">525 A.2d 1195</a>, the MCARE Fund asserted that since the enactment of the MCARE Act, which repealed the Health Care Services Malpractice Act (Malpractice Act) and transferred the rights and responsibilities of the CAT Fund to the MCARE Fund, the Insurance Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over all of the MCARE Fund’s written determinations. The MCARE Fund argued that such exclusive jurisdiction deprived the Commonwealth Court of subject matter jurisdiction over Fletcher’s petition. <em>See </em>40 P.S. §§ 1303.712 (“There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Fund.”), 1303.713(a) (“The [MCARE] fund shall be administered by the [Insurance] department.”); 2 Pa.C.S. § 501 <em>et seq.; Myers v.

The MCARE Fund further asserted that because Fletcher failed to bring her claim to reverse the MCARE Fund’s coverage determination before the Insurance Department, she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>

Because the MCARE Fund was established within the Insurance Department, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 1303.713(a), the judge agreed with the MCARE Fund that the Insurance Department, not the Commonwealth Court, had original jurisdiction over Fletcher’s action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Fletcher filed an application for reargument, which the Commonwealth Court granted. Before the three-judge Commonwealth Court panel, the MCARE Fund again argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the Insurance Department possesses exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over all of the MCARE Fund’s written determinations. Although the MCARE Fund agreed that the Commonwealth Court properly exercised original jurisdiction over the CAT Fund, <em>see Ohio Casualty, </em>the MCARE Fund asserted that this was because the CAT Fund, unlike the MCARE Fund, was an independent Commonwealth agency without a formal administrative hearing process. Because the MCARE Act located the MCARE Fund in the Insurance Department, the MCARE Fund argued that the legislature abrogated the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction over these claims, and subjected the MCARE Fund to the Insurance Department’s internal appeal process. According to the MCARE Fund, therefore, all of its determinations, like all other Insurance Department determinations, are appealable first to the Department’s Administrative Hearings Office, then to the Insurance Commissioner, and only then to the Commonwealth Court in its appellate jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

According to <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>Fletcher, the MCARE Act contains many of the same provisions contained in the former Malpractice Act, and the General Assembly did not alter the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction over coverage disputes. Fletcher pointed out that although Section 712(d)(3) of the MCARE Act, 40 P.S. § 1303.712(d)(3), expressly provides for administrative appeals of assessments to the Insurance Department, the Act is silent as to administrative appeals involving coverage determinations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Thus, under the principle of statutory construction <em>expressio imius est exdusio alterius </em>(the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another), Fletcher argued that the MCARE Act’s failure to include an express administrative appeal provision for coverage disputes implied that none was intended and that, therefore, the General Assembly left the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction over such disputes intact.</p>

First, the court held that the MCARE Act’s silence on the resolution of coverage disputes indicated that the legislature did not intend to change the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction, as articulated by this Court in <em>Ohio Casualty. </em>Second, the similarity of language and responsibilities between the Malpractice Act and the MCARE Act supported the conclusion that the General Assembly did not intend to change the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court in regard to coverage disputes. Finally, the court found that there were no adequate regulatory procedures within the Insurance Department to resolve coverage disputes involving the MCARE Fund.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

This question involves statutory interpretation and as such, presents a question of law over which our scope of review is plenary and the standard of review is <em>de novo. Kopko v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/586/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="586 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="5653048" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0170-01">586 Pa. 170</a>, <a href="/pa/586/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="892 A.2d 766" data-case-ids="5653048,8988656" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0170-01,/a2d/892/0766-01">892 A.2d 766</a>, 770 (2006). To the extent this case involves statutory construction, we are mindful of the principles that guide us. Specifically, in determining legislative intent, sections of a statute must be read together and construed with reference to the entire statute. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). When the words of a statute are free and clear of all ambiguity, we <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>cannot disregard the letter of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Also, where the legislature includes specific language in one section of the statute and excludes it from another, the language should not be implied where excluded. <em>Fonner v.

As explained above, pursuant to <em>Ohio Casualty, </em>questions of the CAT Fund’s statutory liability were brought in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. Similarly, pursuant to <em>Meier, </em>challenges to the CAT Fund’s assessment determinations were also brought in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. When it enacted the MCARE Act and repealed the Malpractice Act, the legislature, presumably with knowledge of <em>Meier, </em>singled out assessment appeals and provided a specific statutory appeal process: “Any appeal of the assessment shall be filed with the department.” 40 P.S. § 1303.712(d)(3). In contrast, the legislature, presumably with knowledge of <em>Ohio Casualty, </em>was silent regarding a procedure for appealing decisions involving the MCARE Fund’s statutory liability. Therefore, by addressing assessment appeals but not coverage appeals, the legislature implicitly left intact the existing appeal process for liability disputes in accord with <em>Ohio Casualty. </em>A fundamental principle of statutory construction is that when a section of a statute contains a given provision, the omission of that provision from a similar section is significant to show a different intention existed. <em>Commonwealth v.

We explained that nebulous claims of informal procedures or implied administrative powers are unavailing since there must be a concrete procedural remedy through which the litigant can achieve a resolution of his claim that does not depend on the grace of the party against whom he is proceeding. <em>Ohio Casualty, </em><a href="/pa/514/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="514 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="1804522" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0430-01">525 A.2d at 1198</a>. As the Commonwealth Court noted in the instant case, these regulations remain largely unchanged and thus do not demonstrate the adequacy of a regulatory procedure. Although, as the MCARE Fund notes, the Insurance Commissioner promulgated a regulation providing that that an aggrieved party who disputes a written determination of the MCARE Fund may request a formal administrative hearing, the MCARE Fund does not explain how, or whether, such a review process is capable of providing the relief sought. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20Bull.%204553" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="32 Pa.

In fact, the MCARE Fund seems to say that by providing a letter notifying Fletcher of her right to seek relief before the Insurance Department, the MCARE Fund provided an adequate administrative remedy.
