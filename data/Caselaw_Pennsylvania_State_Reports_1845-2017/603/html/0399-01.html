Further, according to Appellants, the decision is irreconcilable with <em>Pallante. See Pallante, </em><a href="/pa-super/427/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="427 Pa.

Appellants also indicate that, in 1999, the American Law Institute approved the same rule as that enunciated in <em>Mamalis. See </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability § 16 Reporter’s Note, cmt. d (1999) (“Release of both the agent and the vicariously liable party upon a settlement with one of those parties is logically required [since o]nly one measure of responsibility will be assigned to all such parties.”). Likewise, Appellants observe that the Subcommittee Note to the 2003 Revision of the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions opines that <em>Mamalis </em>and <em>Pallante </em>prevent subjecting an agent to duplicative actions by his principal and the original plaintiff. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions § 4.20 (2008). Finally, Appellants submit that the Superior Court’s decision may expose Dr. Prendergast to claims exceeding Appellee’s actual damages should he be subject to a claim asserted by the <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>MCARE Fund under indemnity and/or equitable subrogation theories, <em>see generally, Judge v.

      <em>[Mamalis </em>] noted that if the plaintiff were permitted to proceed against the piincipal, the principal would in turn seek indemnification from the ... settling plaintiff, because it is unlikely that the agent would settle unless the plaintiff agreed to reimburse the agent, in the event any other defendant sought contribution from the agent. “If plaintiff agrees to indemnify the agent for any claim by the principal in a release, then the settling plaintiff can gain no more than what he received under the release — the settlement amount agreed to by the agent.” <em>[Mamalis, <a href="/pa/522/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="522 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1818934" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0214-01">522 </a></em><a href="/pa/522/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="522 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1818934" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0214-01">Pa. at 222</a>,] <a href="/pa/522/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="522 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1818934" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0214-01">560 A.2d at 1383</a>.

Although <em>Pallante </em>extended the common-law rule of <em>Mamalis </em>to the scenario entailing a matter-of-law release of an agent based on a written release of a principal, Appellee does not challenge the decision. Rather, he distinguishes <em>Pallante </em>based on the fact that there is no indication that the language of the written release included a reservation of rights, and on the ground that <em>Mamalis’ </em>single-tort logic does not extend to scenarios encompassing allegations of multiple acts of negligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The policy justification for allocating 100 percent liability (from the plaintiffs perspective) to one who bears only, say, 40 percent of the responsibility is that, as between an innocent injured party and a culpable defendant, the defendant should bear the risk of additional loss. <em>See Harsh v. Petroll, </em><a href="/pa/584/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="584 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="988551" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0606-01">584 Pa. 606</a>, 620, <a href="/a2d/887/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="887 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="8998420,988551" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0209-01,/pa/584/0606-01">887 A.2d 209</a>, 217 (2005). Thus, joint-and-several liability can be regarded as employing a form of legal imputation like that involved in the application of vicarious liability. The primary difference is simply that the imputation is of 60 percent of the damages in the above example of joint-and-several liability (since the defendant bears 40 percent of the responsibility of his own accord), whereas the general rule is 100 percent in the case of vicarious liability. The fact that a similar form of legal imputation exists in both scenarios, however, weakens the portion of <em>Mamalis’ </em>reasoning to the degree it rests on the fact of imputation alone (which appears to be Justice Greenspan’s focus) to distinguish the treatment of joint-and-several and vicarious liability in the settlement context.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

If Mr. Maloney and the Hospitals agree to a settlement for three acts of negligence, then those three acts are fully compensated and no recovery ought to be available from Dr. Prendergast. The existence of other acts of negligence is irrelevant. If the vicariously hable principal Hospitals settled with Mr. Maloney for those three acts, then Dr. Prendergast is released for those three acts because the wrongful acts have been fully compensated. Whether there is one negligent act or many, what matters is not the number of acts but whether the Hospitals are liable as a joint tortfeasors or as vicariously hable principals. Here, the Hospitals, as vicariously liable principals, were broadly released for any and all liability, so Dr. Prendergast was discharged in equal part. The majority’s holding to the contrary conflates vicarious liability with joint liability.</p>

Mr. Maloney’s argument, adopted by the majority in its opinion, <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>might have merit if the release was narrowly tailored so as to apply only to claims arising from specific acts of malpractice. The release was not so tailored. The language of the release was drafted so broadly that it discharges all claims, including those asserted against Dr. Prendergast. The release clearly states that Dr. Brennan, Brighton, Valley, Beaver, Heritage, Tri-State, and the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Fund (the “MCARE Fund”) were released “from any or all causes of action ... arising from, or in any way connected with all medical, professional health <em>services </em>rendered by the above named Health Care Providers.” Release, ¶ 1 (emphasis added). If Mr. Maloney wanted to preserve claims against Dr. Prendergast, this language should have been drafted more narrowly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_10" id="ref_footnote_2_10">10</a>

Mr. Maloney has asserted claims based on direct liability against Dr. Prendergast and Dr. Brennan, claims based on vicarious liability against the Hospitals and the Beaver Hospitals, and claims based on direct liability <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>against the Hospitals and the Beaver Hospitals. Therefore pursuant to <em>Mamalis, </em>Dr. Prendergast and his employers, the Hospitals, are vicariously liable for any malpractice by Dr. Prendergast. These parties stand in each other’s shoes and together are liable for the wrongdoing. There is a single measure of damages assigned to these parties. Pursuant to the release, the Hospitals have paid for the single measure of damages.</p>

Op. at 412, 984 A.2d at 486. In this respect, I concur with the majority. There is significant value in encouraging settlement in medical malpractice litigation. This is especially true where there is a solvent payment fund, such as the MCARE Fund, available to pay reasonable settlements. For this reason, I would join the majority’s decision to depart from the general rules of vicarious liability and adopt a new exception in the limited context of cases like the instant one, where the parties to a medical malpractice lawsuit draft a clear, express reservation of rights against one physician while releasing the vicariously liable employer Hospitals. I would decline, however, to extend the exception generally to other circumstances and I would acknowledge that the adoption of this exception is a new court-made rule contrary to the general principles of vicarious liability.</p>

The majority also states that '‘[wjooden enforcement of the idea that vicarious liability cannot result in a division of any kind for any purposes and under any circumstances, even pursuant to a voluntary agreement of the parties, would mean that judicial approval could never be lent to a three-way settlement between a plaintiff, an agent-defendant, and his employer relative a claim entailing vicarious liability, where both defendants contribute directly to the settlement.” Maj. Op. at 417 n. 16, 984 A.2d at 489 n. 16. Respectfully, those facts are not presented in the instant case. Here, Dr. Prendergast was not a party to the settlement. If, as the majority aptly observes, the holding of a decision should be read against its facts, then clearly this Court's decision in the instant case will not apply to a factual scenario where both the agent and principal settle. Moreover, once the plaintiff has agreed to settle with both liable tortfeasors, and both tortfeasors have executed a settlement agreement, there would be nothing left to reserve. The complications arising from a reservation of rights would not occur in a case where both liable defendants agree to settle. As is noted in the Restatement (Third) of Torts, Apportionment of Liability (the "Restatement”), "fwjhen a settlement is reached between the plaintiff and all potentially liable tortfeasors, there will normally be no occasion for further judicial proceedings.” RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 24 cmt. a.</p>

Respectfully, Section 24 of the Restatement refers generally to settlement agreements. In contrast, Section 16, which I reference, states the more specific rule applicable in the case of a partial release. The facts of the instant case involve a partial release of the agent. Notwithstanding the general rule set forth in Section 24 of the Restatement, the specific Rule in Section 16 relating to the release of an agent and the discharge of the principal applies in this case.

Or, in the alternative, Mr. Maloney could have chosen not to settle and release the Hospitals, but rather to execute what is known as a "covenant not to sue” in exchange for a lump sum payment. Such a covenant would not release the Hospitals, but it would limit any additional damages they might be obligated to pay if an award was entered at trial. Then Mr. Maloney could have proceeded to trial against Dr. Prendergast (and the Hospitals, albeit in a limited capacity given that they had already agreed to a set measure of damages regardless of the verdict). As yet another alternative, Mr. Maloney could have initiated suit only against Dr. Prendergast and against the Hospitals based on direct liability.
