Although the Commonwealth Court agreed with the Commission that different policies underlie the Act’s requirements in connection with candidates’ financial interest statements and with the avoidance of conflicts by public officials, it noted that the term “business” is specifically defined in the Act and indicated that it was not free to disregard this Court’s interpretation of that term as excluding non-profits. Thus, in view of precedent, the court granted summary relief to Appellees and denied it to the Commission, declaring that the Secretaries would not be under a conflict of interest. <em>See Rendell, </em><a href="/a2d/961/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="961 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="8190016" data-case-paths="/a2d/961/0209-01">961 A.2d at 216</a>.

The dissent stated that, in election matters, the Act must be read <em>in pan materia </em>with the Election Code, which tempers the definition of “business” to protect voter choice. Here, however, the salient rule of construction is that the Act, as remedial legislation, should be liberally construed to accomplish its goal of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. The dissent pointed out that employees and contractors of nonprofit corporations may receive substantial pecuniary gain occasioned by a governmental grant, thus rendering the nonprofit versus for-profit status of a corporation immaterial within the framework of the present issue. The dissent would <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>thus have denied declaratory relief to Appellees on the question of the scope of the Act’s definition of business. However, the dissent would have granted them relief on the issue of whether the Governor must appoint someone outside of the Secretary’s chain of command to perform the grant-making function.

      <em>See </em>Brief for Commission at <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>26. The Commission also argues that, on its face, Section 1102’s definition of business expressly includes any corporation and any organization, without qualification. It submits that, in the final phrase of the definition (“or any legal entity organized for profit”), the “or” is disjunctive, and the independent use of the word “any” in this clause precludes an interpretation that would apply the “for profit” qualification to corporations and organizations. Further, the Commission avers that the qualifier “organized for profit” does not apply to “corporation” or “organization,” because it does not extend to all of the other preceding entities listed in the definition. As an example, the Commission observes that receiverships are not organized for profit.</p>

First, it contends that the Court in <em>Carroll </em>had been erroneously misinformed that the Commission had no rulings as to whether non-profit entities were considered businesses under the act. Citing several of its previous rulings, the Commission submits that it has consistently interpreted the term “business” as it is defined in Section 1102 to include nonprofit corporations and organizations. <em>See </em>Brief for Commission at 29-30. Alternatively, the Commission attempts to distinguish the holding in <em>Carroll </em>by arguing that</p>
    <blockquote id="ABN" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[337,1579,1110,571]]]'>the <em>Cairoll </em>decision did not definitively decide the status of non-profits under the Ethics Act, particularly with respect to situations involving financial interests or relationships. Rather, this Court simply decided that any ambiguity in the definition of “business” should be construed most favorably to candidates seeking ballot access, and that it would not be a fatal defect to a candidate’s nomination petition for the candidate to fail to disclose on his Statement of Financial Interests his involvement with a non-profit corporation from which he receives no compensation and that has nothing to do with his financial interests.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 34 (emphasis is removed). The Commission avers that this factual distinction renders <em>Carroll </em>inapposite to the instant matter. As such, the Commission maintains that <em>Carroll </em>should be distinguished as only applying to election cases <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>involving a candidate’s failure to disclose non-financial' associations on a Statement of Financial Interests filed with nomination petitions.</p>

In this regard, Appellees rely heavily on <em>Carroll, </em>which they view as holding definitively that Section 1102 excludes non-profit organizations from the statutory definition of “business.” In addition to their more general <em>stare decisis </em>argument, Appellees contend that the plain language of the Ethics Act supports the conclusion that non-profit entities are not covered by the statute. Appellees argue that, when several words are followed by a modifying phrase, the natural construction of the language demands that the modifying phrase be read as applicable to all. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 10 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, in determining whether the candidate’s failure to disclose his unpaid directorship positions on the boards of two non-profit organizations constituted a fatal defect to his financial disclosure statement, the Court focused its attention most closely on the fact that no pecuniary or other material gain flowed from the candidate’s positions with <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>the organizations in question. In a footnote, the Court recognized that there were two possible interpretations of the term “business” as set forth in the act’s definitional provision and stated generally that, to the extent the definitional language is ambiguous, it should be construed favorably to the candidate seeking office. <em>See <a href="/pa/586/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="896 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="5653674,8427002" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0624-01,/a2d/896/0566-01">id.</a> </em>at 638 n. 10, <a href="/pa/586/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="896 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="5653674,8427002" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0624-01,/a2d/896/0566-01">896 A.2d at </a>574 n. 10.

In the subsequent dispositional section of the decision, moreover, <em>Camll </em>repeatedly stressed that the crux of the issue concerned the candidate’s financial interests — his compensation, or lack thereof — in connection with the entity in question; the Court rarely, if ever, returned to the significance of the organizations’ non-profit status in the context of the case. Thus, a close reading of <em>Carroll </em>reveals that the language pertaining to the scope of the term “business” was ancillary and, ultimately, unnecessary to the resolution of the controversy. As such, it constituted <em>dicta </em>and left open the question, for our present inquiry, whether the term “business” includes non-profit corporations. <em>See Barnes v.

Rather, if this Court were to decide to overrule these decisions, it should do so openly so as to put the public on notice of this avenue of relief.

First, it is the role of the legislature and not of the courts to set forth the Commonwealth's public policy.

Second, broad opinions issued in a vacuum, as advisoiy opinions necessarily are, cannot consider the true implications and possible exceptions that may arise if interested parties appear before the court.

If those persons who fall under the purview of the Ethics Act (i.e., public officials) wish to change the requirements or the procedure, they should apply to the legislature for such amendments and not to the courts. I recognize that the Ethics Act places a higher burden of disclosure and conduct on public officials than on other Pennsylvanians. These public officials have some relief in the form of <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>advice from the Ethics Commission, which has a duty to interpret the Ethics Act prior to any violation. The Ethics Act does not place the same duty on courts. Indeed, courts have no authority to issue advisory opinions under the Ethics Act and are otherwise prohibited from doing so on prudential grounds. There is no reason to make an exception to the rule against issuing advisory opinions for public officials simply because of their positions. These public officials knew the conduct and disclosure obligations of elected office and, arguably, may be in a better position than other Pennsylvanians to change these requirements by appealing to the legislature.</p>
