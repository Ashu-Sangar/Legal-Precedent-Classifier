Venue lies in the county where his omission occurred, not his obligation. That is Dauphin County-</p>

Nonetheless, the majority, disapproving <em>Bershad </em>and <em>Bernardo, </em>embarks on a fact-intensive analysis of where the acts creating Appellant’s obligation to pay taxes arose. As Appellant both lives and works in Berks County, the majority correctly .concludes Appellant’s obligation to pay personal income taxes arose in Berks County. However, creation of the obligation to pay tax is not a crime — failure to pay is the crime, and the one and only place a person can pay it is in Harrisburg, not Reading.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[134,1095,1154,1159]]]'>Focusing on where the obligation arises is at best confusing. Where is venue if a Montgomery County resident, who works in Philadelphia County for a company headquartered in Allegheny County (from whence his checks come), has a part-time job in Chester County, and earns interest from a bank in Bucks County? The resident earned income from or in all of these counties, and his obligation to pay personal income taxes arose in all of these counties. According to the majority’s rationale, which focuses on the acts creating the obligation to pay tax, the Commonwealth could bring charges in any of these counties. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 130(A)(3) (“When charges arising from the same criminal episode occur in more than one judicial district, [venue lies in any of the judicial districts] in which the charges arising from the same criminal episode occurred.”). One might query whether an obligation to pay, which as above accrues in different ways and at different times, can be the product of a single criminal episode, and if not, serial prosecutions in each county would be permitted. Such an outcome is plainly absurd, yet focusing on the debt rather than the failure to pay exposes parties to criminal charges in each county where they earn income, at the discretion of the Commonwealth.</p>
