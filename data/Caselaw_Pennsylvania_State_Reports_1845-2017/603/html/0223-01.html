Appellant moved to suppress his statement on the Stewart murder and his statements on the Watson murder. On April 5, 1995, the Honorable John J. Poserina, Jr., denied appellant’s motion to suppress.

Under the PCRA, collateral relief is afforded to individuals who prove that they are innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted, and those receiving illegal sentences. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542. “A petitioner is eligible for PCRA relief only when he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the circumstances delineated in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2).” <em>Commonwealth v. Natividad, </em><a href="/pa/595/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="595 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="3844094" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0188-01">595 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/595/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="938 A.2d 310" data-case-ids="3844094,8314466" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0188-01,/a2d/938/0310-01">938 A.2d 310</a>, 320 (2007). One of the grounds enumex-ated in 42 Pa.C.S § 9543(a)(2) involves claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, the PCRA px'ovides relief to those individuals whose convictions or sentences “resulted from ... ineffective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(ii). This Court has intex*preted this to mean that in order to obtain relief on a claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must px'ove that: (1) the claixn underlying the ineffectiveness claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel’s actions lacked aixy reasonable basis; and (3) counsel’s actions resulted in prejudice to petitioner. <em>Commonwealth v.

According to Appellant, because the right to counsel had attached in the Stewart matter and that case was joined with the Watson case for trial, thereby allowing the jury to use Appellant’s confession to the Watson killing as evidence of guilt in the Stewart matter, his confession to the Watson murder was suppressible under the Sixth Amendment because police did not contact counsel before speaking to him.</p>

It was alleged by the defendants in these cases that trial counsel had been ineffective for not requesting limiting instructions following the introduction of other crimes evidence. In both cases, relief was denied because it was not reasonably probable that had cautionary instructions been given, the jury ultimately would have reached a different verdict. This is especially true in the instant appeal, given the overwhelming evidence presented by the Commonwealth against Appellant. That evidence included eyewitness testimony and the introduction of Appellant’s confessions to the two homicide detectives. <em>See Cox, </em><a href="/a2d/728/0923-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="728 A.2d 923" data-case-ids="11626690,607143" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0923-01,/pa/556/0368-01">728 A.2d at 929</a> (reviewing-sufficiency of evidence supporting Appellant’s conviction).

In response, the prosecutor indicated that he believed that Appellant had been the shooter but that he could not state this during his opening address because he first had to present evidence to support his belief.

However, section 9711(d)(7) more broadly focuses on the “commission of the offense,” during which the defendant created a grave risk of death to another person besides the victim of the homicide. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7) (“In the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense.”).

In the present case, the prosecution opened to the jury by stating that the evidence showed Appellant was an accomplice and coconspirator, but not the shooter, in the Watson and Stewart homicides. Although the district attorney explained to the trial judge that he did not feel he could identify Appellant as the shooter in the Watson homicide in his opening remarks since attorneys may not rely on inferences from the evidence in opening statements, <em>see </em>N.T., April 6,1995, at 24, such explanation was erroneous. In this regard, this Court has long recognized that “[s]o long as no liberties are taken with the evidence, a lawyer is free to draw such inferences as he wishes from the testimony and to present his case in the light most suited to advance his cause and win a verdict in the jury box.” <em>Contractors Lumber and Supply Company v.
