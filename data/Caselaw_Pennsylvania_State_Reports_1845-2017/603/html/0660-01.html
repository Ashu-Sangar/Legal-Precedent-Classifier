    <p id="b774-5" data-blocks='[["BL_774.5",774,[302,1144,1154,688]]]'>On May 20, 2000, Appellant’s stepdaughter, Chetia Hurtt, and her boyfriend, Jeffrey Johnson, returned to Hurtt’s apartment from a movie to discover several voicemail messages left by Appellant, questioning where Hurtt was and when she would be home. Hurtt, 21, had known Appellant since he married her mother when Hurtt was five years old, and had lived under the same roof as Appellant, her mother (Katherine Hairston), Appellant’s autistic son (Sean Hairston), and her grandmother (Goldie Hurtt), until Hurtt moved out approximately one month earlier. During Hurtt’s adolescence, her relationship with Appellant deteriorated. Appellant prohibited Hurtt from socializing with males and frequently threatened that he would kill her and the rest of her family.</p>
    <p id="b774-6" data-blocks='[["BL_774.6",774,[303,1858,1153,361]],["BL_775.1",775,[143,340,1153,408]]]'>Bothered by the phone messages that May evening, Hurtt asked Johnson to spend the night. The following morning, May 21; 2000, Appellant arrived at Hurtt’s apartment with a handgun, which he was not licensed to carry. After being let into the apartment, Appellant instructed Hurtt to tell Johnson to leave. When Hurtt did not comply, Appellant threatened to kill Hurtt, Johnson, and himself, and stated that he would not <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>go to jail. Despite Hurtt’s protests that Johnson should stay — for fear of what might happen should he leave — Johnson left the apartment. Appellant pointed the gun at Hurtt’s face and said, “If you’re going to be F’ing anybody, it’s going to be me.” N.T., 04/15/2002, at 52. Hurtt pleaded with Appellant not to hurt her, but he took her into the bedroom. Appellant removed his clothes and tided to remove Hurtt’s clothes, but she resisted.</p>
    <p id="b775-5" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[142,776,1157,891]]]'>Meanwhile, Johnson stopped Sergeant William Gorman of the Pittsburgh Police Department and explained what was occurring. The police went to the apartment and announced their presence. Appellant pulled the ammunition clip out of the gun, threw it behind the door, and slid the gun underneath the bed. Hurtt escaped through the front door of the apartment. The police found a half-naked Appellant in the apartment. He claimed that he lived in the apartment with his daughter and came home to find her with Johnson. A BrycoArms 0.380 semi-automatic pistol was recovered from the bedroom. Appellant, yelling, “I can’t go to jail,” broke away from police as they were bringing him out of the apartment building. Appellant then jumped headfirst off a small roof to the ground fífteen-to-twenty feet below. Appellant got back on his feet and again began yelling, “I can’t go to jail. I’m not going to jail.” <em>Id. </em>at 91. As a result of these events, criminal charges were filed against Appellant.</p>

Appellant spoke separately with two neighbors outside of his home that morning, each of whom noticed that Appellant smelled of alcohol and was very agitated. Appellant told both neighbors that he was upset about his stepdaughter’s accusations, telling one neighbor that he would not go back to jail and that if he had to go to jail he “would probably do [himjself in.” <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>

They discovered that the house was covered in garbage bags and debris. They retrieved Sean, who was lying underneath bags and debris, on the living room couch. His face and head were covered with a blanket. He was brought outside alive to paramedics. However, he died while being treated at the hospital after suffering two cardiac arrests. The injuries leading to his death were two or three incidents of blunt force trauma to his head.</p>

He explained that <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>he wrapped a ten-pound sledgehammer in a pillowcase and intentionally struck his wife with it from behind as she sat on their bed. He struck her a second time, then dragged her from their first-floor sleeping area into the kitchen. Appellant also confessed that, minutes later, he struck his son Sean with the sledgehammer twice. After hearing moans in the kitchen, he struck Katherine again with the weapon. Appellant stated that he left the house with the weapon, drove to a local bar, where he consumed two double-shots and two beers, then discarded the sledgehammer in a wooded area. Appellant then drove home and poured gasoline over the basement floor. According to Appellant, flames from the water heater ignited the gasoline before he was ready to ignite them. He then got a knife, stabbed himself twice in the chest, and then lay down next to his wife’s body. Appellant went on to explain that he intentionally piled items throughout the house to ensure that the fire indeed killed everyone: “I just wanted to make sure that we were gone.” Transcript of Appellant’s taped interview, dated June 19, 2001, at 6. Appellant then revealed to police the location of the sledgehammer, which tested positive for blood.</p>

In his fourth claim on appeal, Appellant argues that neither Clayton Mariner (the ex-boyfriend of Katherine Hairston and friend of the family) nor Avis Beck (the girlfriend of Katherine Hairston’s brother, James Hurlt) should have been permitted to testify to the effect the victims' deaths had on the victims' family. Much of Appellant's argument addresses the construction of the statute governing victim impact testimony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a)(2), and, because it falls outside the scope of this Court's automatic review, is therefore waived.</p>
      <p id="b782-7" data-blocks='[["BL_782.6",782,[333,1064,1122,410]]]'>Nevertheless, Appellant argues that when Mariner responded to one of the prosecutor's questions about the impact of the decedents' deaths on the family, he used the terms "we” and "us,” despite not being a member of the victims' family. According to Appellant, Mariner’s inclusion of himself as a member of the decedents' family impermissibly allowed the juiy to consider the effect the decedents' deaths had on him. Inasmuch as Appellant’s argument can be said to raise a claim that Mariner's testimony constituted an "arbitrary factor,” this Court concludes that Mariner's brief answer to the prosecutor’s question was not a factor that led to Appellant's death sentence.</p>
      <p id="b782-8" data-blocks='[["BL_782.7",782,[331,1480,1125,810]]]'>The record reveals that the prosecutor's direct examination of Mariner straightforwardly established his status as a childhood friend of Katherine Hairston's brother, a friend and ex-boyfriend of Katherine Hairston, and friend of the family. N.T. 04/18/2002, at 54-57. Indeed, the statement which gives rise to Appellant's claim was an answer to the following question posed by the prosecutor: "Could you describe for the jury what you, as a <em>lifelong friend of that family, </em>have observed about the effects that the loss of Kathy and Sean have had on <em>that family there? " Id. </em>at 60 (emphasis added). Further, the trial court instructed the jury that they could only consider "evidence ... of the physical, psychological, and economic impact tírese crimes have had on the <em>family </em>of the murder victims" for the limited purpose of "weighting] the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors.” <em>Id. </em>at 231-232 (emphasis added).
