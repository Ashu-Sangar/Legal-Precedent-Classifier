Thus, recompense to the victim is only a secondary benefit, as restitution is not an award of damages. Although restitution is penal in nature, it is highly favored in the law and encouraged so that the criminal will understand the egregiousness of his or her conduct, be deterred from repeating the conduct, and be encouraged to live in a responsible way. <em>Commonwealth v. Harner, </em><a href="/pa/533/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="533 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1837511" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0014-01">533 Pa. 14</a>, 22, <a href="/pa/533/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="533 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1837511" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0014-01">617 A.2d 702</a>, 706-07 (1992).

Brown contends the Superior Court erred in finding Medicare was entitled to restitution under Section 1106. According to Brown, the focus of the restitution statute is on the victim. Pointing to the 1995 amendments to Section 1106, wherein the legislature expanded those entities eligible to receive restitution, Brown offers that the General Assembly did not amend the definition of “victim” to include governmental agencies. Furthermore, while the statute may suggest a government agency’s entitlement to restitution, the type of governmental agency entitled to restitution under Section 1106 is limited to those which provide reimbursement for loss directly to the victim and does not extend to every governmental agency which merely provides services to vic<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>tims. Moreover, Brown contends that prior Superior Court case law is consistent with this limited view of restitution, emphasizing that, if the victim becomes society, the defendant is no longer compensating the victim for losses which he or she personally suffered, and the purpose of restitution is lost. Thus, when viewing Section 1106 as a whole and considering its underlying purpose, Brown asserts only those agencies which provide compensation directly to the victim — i.e., reimbursement to victims for out-of-pocket expenses which they have personally incurred — rather than agencies which provide services to the victim — should receive restitution. Here, Medicare provided compensation to Lancaster General Hospital and not the victim; thus, Brown avers, he should not have been ordered to pay restitution to Medicare.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[295,1127,1158,1244]]]'>The Commonwealth responds by pointing to the terms of Section 1106 which specifically mandate that restitution be ordered for losses previously compensated by the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund or other governmental agency, acting in addition to, or in place of, the board that has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the offender’s conduct. 18 Pa.C.S.A § 1106(c). According to the Commonwealth, Medicare is a government agency which compensated the victim for medical bills for which he would ordinarily be personally responsible. The Commonwealth also suggests Medicare is effectively serving as the victim’s insurance company and, as such, should be entitled to reimbursement for this expense. Moreover, the Commonwealth refutes the assertion that upholding the Superior Court’s decision will open the doors for claims of restitution for a myriad of other services provided by government agencies, as permitting Medicare to receive restitution only compensates the victim for losses he sustained. The Commonwealth submits, not only is Medicare compensating for the victim’s medical expenses, but, by requiring the offender to make restitution to both insured and uninsured victims, the underlying policy of impressing upon the offender the magnitude of the loss that he caused and his responsibility to repair that loss will be served.</p>

Specifically, by its terms, Section 1106 envisions restitution be paid to: (1) the victim; (2) the Crime Victim’s Compensation Board; (3) “[a]ny other government agency which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct;” and (4) “[a]ny insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(l)(ii)(A-D).

Prior to 1995, restitution was discretionary: “the offender may be sentenced to make restitution.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a). Furthermore, only the “victim” was permitted restitution and the victim was defined as a “person.” Writing for our Court, then-Justice, now-Chief Justice Castille, spoke to the breadth of the pre-amendment restitution statute in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Runion, </em>a victim, who was a welfare recipient, was assaulted, and hospitalized for her injuries. The Department of Public Welfare paid the victim’s medical costs and filed for restitution. The trial court and Superior Court found that the Department could be considered a victim for restitution purposes. Our Court opined that Section 1106 failed to indicate whether government agencies were considered to be within the definition of “victim,” which was defined as any “person” who suffered injuries as a direct result of the crime. 18 Pa.C.S.A § 1106(h). Therefore, we turned to the Statutory Construction Act’s definition of “person.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1991. The Court reasoned that, based upon the statutory definition of that term, which excluded from the definition of “person” government agencies of the Commonwealth, government agencies did not fall within the definition of “victim,” and, therefore, were not eligible for restitution. <em>Runion, </em>at 210, <a href="/pa/541/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="662 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="470757,7863141" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0202-01,/a2d/662/0617-01">662 A.2d at 621</a>.</p>

The Superior Court majority focused on the fact that the amendments did not include a government agency as a “victim,” and reasoned that the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund and insurance companies, who were included in the expanded definition, made direct payments to the victim, and, thus, could receive restitution from the offender. In reaching this conclusion, the court opined that the legislature “never intended to include the numerous governmental agencies which provide social, medical and supportive services to victims of crime.

As noted above, and expressed by our Court in <em>Runion, </em>the main purpose behind the statute is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him that his criminal conduct caused the victim’s loss or personal injury and that it is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as possible, and that compensation to the victim is only secondary. <em>Runion, </em>at 206, <a href="/pa/541/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="662 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="470757,7863141" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0202-01,/a2d/662/0617-01">662 A.2d at 618</a>.

Thus, an interpretation allowing receipt of restitution by those entities that directly and indirectly provided compensation to the victim of a crime would be consonant with the overarching purposes of restitution — rehabilitation and deterrence — and the object to be obtained by the amended restitution statute. Again, we are directed by the legislature that “[t]he provisions of this title shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>title and the special purposes of the particular provision involved.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 105.

Here, Medicare paid the medical provider directly. To treat these scenarios differently would not only ignore the reality of how medical billing and payments are typically processed, but also would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the intent of the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922 (providing that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable).

Furthermore, we do not believe that such an interpretation would result in the adverse consequences suggested by Brown and posited by the Superior Court in <em>Figueroa, </em>where restitution is transformed into a reimbursement to society. Rather, such an interpretation is limited to those government agencies which make payments on behalf of a victim of a crime.
