In the case before us, the parties entered into a marriage and property settlement agreement that provided for the payment of attorney fees and costs incurred by one party in enforcing the contract against the breaching party. The trial court concluded that Appellee Ronald E. Kutz (“Husband”) breached the agreement by failing to pay Appellant Marjorie R. McMullen (“Wife”) sufficient child support and that the contract provided that the breaching party must pay the attorney fees expended by the non-breaching party. The trial court, however, granted Wife less than half of the attorney fees she claimed to have incurred in litigating her breach of contract action because the court found that the amount claimed was unreasonable in light of the nature of the claim and Wife’s failure to seek an out-of-court settlement of the dispute prior to initiating litigation. On appeal to the Superior Court, Wife claimed that the trial court erred in considering the reasonableness of the fees when the contract provided for the full payment of the attorney fees “incurred.” A divided Superior Court panel held that the trial court had the inherent duty to consider the reasonableness of a counsel fee award. We <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>granted allowance of appeal, and, after full and careful consideration of Wife’s arguments, affirm the decisions of the trial court and Superior Court, finding that courts may consider reasonableness when making a counsel fee award, regardless of the precise verbiage of the document authorizing such award.</p>

On July 7, 2000, Wife and Husband entered into a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”), under which Husband conceded that thirty-five percent of “his disposable military pension shall be the sole and exclusive property” of Wife. Agreement at ¶ 9(d). Additionally, Husband agreed to pay Wife $1200 per month as support for the five children until an “Emancipation Event.” Agreement at ¶ 12(a). The contractual provision describing an emancipation event relevant to this case states:</p>

    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[302,555,1156,1371]]]'>In September 2005, Wife filed a petition to enforce the Agreement alleging that Husband had breached it by failing to pay support for their eldest son during July and August 2005, following his graduation from high school, and for failing to pay Wife her full share of the military pension due. Although not relevant to our inquiry, the discrepancy resulted when Husband interpreted the Agreement as pei-mitting him to cease payment of child support for his oldest son during the summer between his high school graduation and the beginning of college, despite the son’s uncontested intent to enroll in college in the fall. Additionally, during the first few months of Husband’s retirement, Husband paid to Wife 35% of Husband’s <em>net </em>retirement check. At some point thereafter, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) began to pay Wife directly, and paid her 35% of his <em>gross </em>retirement check. Wife asserted that she was entitled to the child support for the months between the parties’ eldest son’s high school graduation and his enrollment in college, and the discrepancy in the calculation of her percentage of his retirement checks. The trial court found for Wife on both issues in December of 2005, and later explained its ruling: “While [Husband’s] uncounseled interpretation of the [Agreement] was reasonable, we found that it was also erroneous.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 2. The court, thus, calculated the amount owed by Husband to Wife as $792.12 in unpaid retirement benefits and unpaid child support.</p>

The court, in considering the imposition of counsel fees, refused to grant Wife the $3000 of fees she claimed. The court noted the following in this regard:</p>

We note that there was no attempt by her counsel to resolve' these issues short of involving the courts. Counsel’s first contact with [Husband] in connection with these matters was a letter which accompanied the “Petition to Enforce.” The letter demanded payment of all sums due plus counsel fees. However, there was no breakdown of what sums were due, or the counsel fees being claimed.</blockquote>

Further, the record is devoid of any attempt by [Wife], or her counsel, to resolve the issues or to keep counsel fees reasonable.

    <p id="b719-6" data-blocks='[["BL_719.6",719,[146,1209,1156,1177]]]'>Wife appealed to the Superior Court urging that the trial court erred in considering the reasonableness of the attorney fees when the Agreement, signed by the parties, granted the non-breaching party the fees “incurred” without any qualification regarding the reasonableness of the fees. Wife argued that the decision should be controlled by the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Creeks v. Creeks, </em><a href="/pa-super/422/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="422 Pa. Super. 432" data-case-ids="923495" data-case-paths="/pa-super/422/0432-01">422 Pa.Super. 432</a>, <a href="/pa-super/422/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="422 Pa.

In that case, the principal dispute concerned whether a party had, in fact, breached an agreement. The Superior Court concluded that the party had breached the applicable contract, and premised thereon, reversed the trial court’s denial of attorney fees. The court in <em>Creeks, </em>however, did not address the reasonableness of the fees. Moreover, unlike the case at bar, the agreement in <em>Creeks </em>contained a clause specifically addressing the reasonableness of the potential attorney fees: “the prevailing party in such proceedings shall be entitled to an award of counsel fees for all time <em>reasonably </em>expended in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.” <em>Creeks, </em><a href="/pa-super/422/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="422 Pa.

      <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>The Superior Court, in the case at bar, framed the question as whether a court could find a reasonableness requirement to be implicit in a contract. In finding the reasonableness criteria to be implicit, the court relied upon its earlier decision in <em>Duffy v. Gerst, </em><a href="/pa-super/286/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="286 Pa.

Ulico Cas. Co., </em><a href="/md/380/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="380 Md. 285" data-case-ids="20986" data-case-paths="/md/380/0285-01">380 Md. 285</a>, <a href="/md/380/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="380 Md. 285" data-case-ids="20986" data-case-paths="/md/380/0285-01">844 A.2d 460</a>, 478 (2004) (“When a contract entitles a party to recover attorney’s fees, the trial court must examine the fee request to determine whether it is reasonable even in the absence of a provision requiring that the fee request be reasonable.”).</p>
    <p id="b720-4" data-blocks='[["BL_720.4",720,[302,1208,1151,353]]]'>The Superior Court additionally concluded that the trial court properly considered Wife’s counsel’s failure to seek settlement when the court weighed the reasonableness of counsel’s fees.

The dissent also found fault with the trial court’s finding that the fee was unreasonable based upon Wife’s counsel’s failure to seek settlement: “Whether [Wife] attempted to settle this matter short of litigation simply is not a factor to be considered by a court in assessing the reasonableness of attorney’s fees.

Husband contends that public policy supports the incorporation of a reasonableness inquiry. He claims that reasonableness is implicit because Pennsylvania courts have inherent supervisory authority over attorneys and thus have the power to rule on the reasonableness of any attorney fee. Second, Husband contends that to refuse to read reasonableness into every provision for attorney fees could place courts in the untenable situation of being forced to award a “clearly excessive or scandalous” attorney fee.

We respectfully disagree with the dissent's interpretation of this question. Instead, we take a broader view of the arguably poorly worded question presented to us in Appellant's Petition for Allowance of Appeal. Obviously, we did not grant review to determine whether the Court "should ... grant this petition” as the question is literally phrased, and we recognize that the dissent does not so claim. Additionally, however, we did not grant review, as the dissent would suggest, to decide the very limited question of whether the Superior Court’s decision in the case sub judice conflicts with prior decisions of that court. Our Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that we grant review "only when there are special and important reasons therefor.” Pa.R.A.P. 1114. While our Internal Operating Procedures § 5(A)(1) provides for granting review where "the holding of the intermediate appellate court conflicts with another intermediate appellate court opinion,” there would be no special or important reason to draft an opinion that holds merely that a Superior Court decision does or does not conflict with prior precedent of that court unless we then clarified for the bench and bar the correct rule of law in the explored area. Accordingly, we conclude that the question granted extended to whether the decision below, finding that the trial court was authorized to consider the reasonableness of attorney fees, was correct, and we conclude further that it was for the reasons set forth in this Opinion.</p>

    <p id="b732-7" data-blocks='[["BL_732.8",732,[301,987,1151,579]]]'>The Majority adopts a new rule that adult parties to a contract, even those represented by counsel, cannot agree between themselves that, should one party breach the agreement, the breaching party must pay the non-breaching party’s attorney’s fees in full. The Majority concludes that courts are authorized to insert a requirement of reasonability of the fees due to the potential for abuse if one party knows the other will be paying the fee. Even if I shared the Majority’s cynicism concerning the bar’s charging practices, I would not adopt the policy the Majority has adopted to undo arms’ length contracts that are a quintessential expression of American free will.</p>
    <p id="b732-8" data-blocks='[["BL_732.9",732,[299,1590,1151,634]],["BL_733.1",733,[137,325,1150,455]]]'>Proper disposition of this appeal requires a proper framing, and there are three points that, I believe, provide necessary perspective. The first point is Justice Saylor’s observation that this case is more momentous than the Majority would make it out to be, and the new rule summarily approved is rendered in a case where the briefing is not up to the task. <em>See </em>Saylor, J., Concurring and Dissenting Op., at 616, 985 A.2d at 778. The parties’ briefs, and particularly appellant’s brief, present argument on the above issue but only as a secondary matter, not as the primary argument advanced. Instead, the parties appropriately devoted their arguments to the issue this Court actually agreed to hear regarding the <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>potential conflict between different Superior Court panel decisions. In addition, the order granting allocatur was not framed in a manner to put other potentially interested parties, such as the organized bar, on notice that we might approve a rule which allows trial judges, in their discretion, to take it upon themselves to reduce contractually-based awards of attorneys’ fees. And so we are left without the input of the practicing bar — which knows more about the current financial pressures of practicing law than this Court does.</p>
    <p id="b733-5" data-blocks='[["BL_733.4",733,[135,802,1152,663]]]'>Second, and similarly, the Majority’s easy approval of the trial court’s <em>sua sponte </em>action should not obscure just how intrusive that action was. The Majority apparently credits appellee’s argument that reasonableness inquiries are appropriate because Pennsylvania courts have inherent supervisory authority over Pennsylvania attorneys. This Court indeed has such supervisory authority, but the lower courts have that authority, in a matter such as this, only to the extent we have approved it. The trial court here acted without the imprimatur of approval from this Court, and the existing Superior Court authority is, as Justice Saylor has demonstrated, uniquely unreasoned. It is perfectly appropriate for the aggrieved party to seek review of such an action.</p>
    <p id="b733-6" data-blocks='[["BL_733.5",733,[133,1488,1151,769]]]'>Third is the fact, also duly noted by Justice Saylor, that there is already existing protection against unconscionable contract provisions, which logically extends to “an unconscionable fee-shifting provision, or a provision yielding unconscionable results.” Saylor, J., Concurring and Dissenting Op., at 617 n. 1, 985 A.2d at 778 n. 1 (citing <em>Salley v. Option One Mortgage Corp., </em><a href="/pa/592/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="592 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="3555332" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0323-01">592 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="925 A.2d 115" data-case-ids="3555332,8303148" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0323-01,/a2d/925/0115-01">925 A.2d 115</a> (2007)). And so it is not accurate to conclude, as the Majority has, that failure to authorize <em>sua sponte </em>review for reasonableness will result “in no safety valve and courts would be required to award attorney’s fees even when such fees are clearly excessive.” Majority Op., at 613, 985 A.2d at 776. Although the Majority’s rule is cloaked in terms of “reasonableness,” it will be an overly invasive rule, and difficult to define in a fashion that would promise any modicum of even and fair application.</p>

I find persuasive appellant’s argument that, when the terms of a written contract are clear, a court should not re-craft the agreement to conflict with its plain language.

    <p id="b734-6" data-blocks='[["BL_734.6",734,[297,1573,1156,510]]]'>The parties’ agreement in this instance was clear and unambiguous. It provided that: “the party breaching this contract shall be responsible for the payment of legal fees and costs incurred by the other in enforcing their rights under this Agreement” (emphasis added). There is nothing about “reasonableness” in the contract; there is nothing reposing the measure of reasonableness in a trial court’s idiosyncratic judgment (as opposed to, for example, the parties’ familiarity with each other); and there is nothing inherently unconscionable in the omission of the term.</p>
    <p id="b734-7" data-blocks='[["BL_734.7",734,[298,2116,1154,251]],["BL_735.1",735,[146,339,1155,530]]]'>Therefore, the meaning of the attorney’s fees provisions should be divined from the language of the agreement itself, and not according to the trial court’s imposition of a requirement that the attorney’s fees be reasonable.

And that judgment, in turn, was suspect to the extent that the trial court factored in its disapproval of appellant for failing to pursue settlement in a case where she was the innocent and aggrieved party. There is no allegation that the parties’ agreement was the result of anything other than arm’s length negotiations. There is nothing on the face of the agreement, or in the amount of attorney’s fees, that is unconscionable. Therefore, the parties should be held to the terms of the agreement they negotiated.</p>
    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.4",735,[146,901,1156,475]]]'>The result of the trial court’s decision is that appellant is now forced to bear a substantial portion of the financial burden of appellee’s unilateral breach of their agreement. The inclusion of the attorney’s fees provision in the parties’ agreement obviously was intended as a disincentive to breach the agreement. The trial court has removed that disincentive and, in effect, penalized appellant for appellee’s breach. That is contrary to the clear intent of the parties’ contract and to Pennsylvania authority regarding contract interpretation.</p>

Moreover, appellee had his own self-help remedy to shield himself against such costs: he could have just honored his obligation, and when called to task for failing to do so, he should be bound by his contractual agreement.</p>

Majority Op., at 615, 985 A.2d at 777. Obviously, it is one thing to entertain issues actually raised by a party, and quite another thing to become a party’s champion, uninvited. The Majority recognizes that <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>appellant argues this very point, <em>id. </em>at 608-11, 985 A.2d at 773-74, yet inexplicably leaves it undecided.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[306,447,1152,1045]]]'>Equally inexplicable is the fact that the Majority denies appellant any opportunity to prove the reasonableness of the fee. The Majority merely purports to authorize reasonableness inquiries at the trial court level and then washes its decisional hands. Nor does the Majority provide any guidance as to just how that inquiry should proceed: There is no discussion of which party has the burden of proof, the party seeking fees or the party responsible for the fees; no suggestions regarding factors trial courts should consider in making the reasonableness assessment; or even any parameters or limits on the trial court’s discretion. Would a trial court’s inquiry necessarily be different in cases in rural communities than in urban locations where average attorney hourly rates are likely higher? Should trial courts treat family law matters differently or the same as other civil matters? The Majority Opinion leaves all of these questions unanswered. In short, the Majority reaches out to “decide” an issue arguably not encompassed in our grant of review and one that the parties did not fully brief, and then approves a general and intrusive power without offering the bench and bar any clue concerning the actual exercise of this new, disruptive power.</p>
    <p id="b736-6" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[306,1512,1152,702]]]'>There is nothing in the record before this Court to indicate that the trial court heard any evidence regarding the reasonableness of the fee. Notably, appellant has forwarded a very modest request that, if the intrusion be approved, this Court should remand to the trial court for just such a fact-finding. The Majority says no. The result is a judicial double-blow: The Majority unnecessarily reaches out to decide a broad question of policy in a case ill-suited to the task, announcing a new rule of law allowing trial courts to <em>sua sponte </em>look outside the language of an arms’ length contract and thereby drastically altering appellant’s expectations; and then denies appellant any opportunity to prove the reasonableness of the fees her counsel charged, leaving intact an unmoored and unexplained fee reduction.</p>

Any decision on the reasonableness of a fee is fact-bound. For wealthy litigants employing major law firm partners, for example, it is difficult to imagine that a fee of $3,000 would be considered unreasonable for purposes of any litigation. I realize that the means of the parties here are more modest, but it is still difficult to see a $3,000 fee for litigation services as manifestly excessive. There is no support for a conclusion that the fee is <em>per se </em>unreasonable, and the trial court’s 60% reduction of the actual fee was based, in part, upon an inappropriate punitive consideration. And so, if we must decide the abstract question the Majority decides, I would also decide the actual case: and I would reverse since this fee-reduction is inherently suspect, it is unsupported by any factual record, it is uncabined by any defined parameters governing such interference, and the fee reduction, therefore, is essentially arbitrary. And that is unreasonable.</p>
