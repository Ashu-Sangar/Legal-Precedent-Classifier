It would be illogical to suppose the General Assembly intended to dictate the ministerial matter of the manner in which employees were paid, but not deal with the obvious question of how much.

Prior to 1992, retirement credit for leave of service with a collective bargaining organization was not permitted under the Code.

Responding to the Attorney General’s opinion, the General Assembly amended the definition of “[a]pproved leave of absence” to include “service with a collective bargaining organization.” <em>See </em>Act of <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>November 30, 1992, P.L. 737, No. 112; <em>see also </em>Act of April 29, 1994, P.L. 159, No. 29.</p>
