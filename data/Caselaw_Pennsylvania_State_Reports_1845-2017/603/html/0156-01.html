The District Attorney of Bucks County did not oppose Hunt’s petition for expungement. On July 6, 2006, the trial court ordered the State Police, and, <em>inter alia, </em>other local and federal law enforcement agencies, to expunge Hunt’s criminal record due to his successful completion of the conditions imposed upon him in connection with the ARD program.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> No appeal was taken by the District Attorney.</p>

Section 9122(b.l), the effective date of which was April 22, 1997, provides that a trial court shall not have the authority to order expungement of a defendant’s record where such defendant, like Hunt, was placed on ARD for, <em>inter alia, </em>indecent assault, where the victim was under 18 years of age. <em>Id. </em>The District Attorney agreed to file a motion to vacate <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Thereafter, on September 19, 2006, the trial court rescinded Hunt’s expungement order.</p>

Specifically, Hunt requested: an order directing the State Police to comply with the trial court’s expungement order; actual and real damages; reasonable costs of litigation; counsel fees; and exemplary and punitive damages. Petition for Review at 5. In the alternative, Hunt requested a writ in mandamus compelling expungement. Petition for Review at 6. The same day, Hunt filed an Application for Summary Judgment in which he asserted the State Police “has no standing to object to, let alone willfully and repeatedly disobey, an order of expungement of an arrest record.” Application for Summary Relief at 2.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[129,1472,1151,670]]]'>On March 1, 2007, the State Police filed preliminary objections, claiming Hunt’s Petition for Review failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Specifically, the State Police contended it could not comply with the trial court’s order, as Section 9122(b.l) precluded expungement and the trial court erroneously concluded this provision was not retroactive to prohibit expungement of offenses prior to its effective date. The State Police also alleged that, when Hunt completed ARD in 1976, there was no automatic entitlement to expungement of one’s criminal record. According to the State Police, as there was no clear right to expungement, there was no corresponding duty for the State Police to expunge Hunt’s criminal record.</p>

Noting <em>J.H. </em>involved a virtually identical factual scenario concerning the State Police’s refusal to expunge a criminal record, Judge Pellegrini found the law clear that, because the General Assembly did not confer standing on the State Police, and because the State Police was a mere depository of criminal records that it received from reporting agencies, the State Police did not have standing to contest the trial court’s expungement order. Based upon this binding-precedent, Judge Pellegrini ordered the State Police to comply with the trial court’s October 19, 2006 order.</p>

The State Police contends it has standing to contest the trial court’s expungement order because this matter arises from a petition in mandamus filed by one seeking enforcement of an expungement order, whereas <em>J.H., </em>relied on by the Commonwealth Court, arose in the context of a motion to compel. Specifically, the State Police offers that, in <em>J.H., </em>the appeal arose from a motion to compel filed before the trial court. Here, the matter arose as a result of a petition for review in mandamus, filed in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. Citing <em>Fajohn v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/547/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="547 Pa. 649" data-case-ids="468683" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0649-01">547 Pa. 649</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1067-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="692 A.2d 1067" data-case-ids="11919620,468683" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1067-01,/pa/547/0649-01">692 A.2d 1067</a> (1997), the State Police contends mandamus is not available to compel an agency to engage in an illegal act. According to the State Police, the order directing expungement is without legal authority, and, thus, <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>the State Police should have standing to contest “this patently illegal order.” State Police Brief at 15. Furthermore, the State Police claims this case involves an order of expungement of an arrest that resulted in placement in a pre-trial diversionary program. Pursuant to Section 9122(c) of CHRIA, the State Police, acting as a central repository, is charged with maintaining a list of the names and other criminal history record information of persons whose records are required by law or court rule to be expunged where the individual successfully completed the conditions of any pretrial or post-trial diversion or probation program. As this information is to be used to determine subsequent eligibility for such programs and for identifying persons in criminal investigations, the State Police asserts it has standing.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[126,1091,1154,1004]]]'>Additionally, the State Police maintains it has standing because it has been aggrieved by an action or order. According to the State Police, in its role as the keeper of records, it would be prevented from retaining the record of a sexual offender whose victims were minors. The State Police further explains Hunt could commit other offenses against minors, and seek ARD to which, according to the State Police, he would not be entitled. Also, since there would be no record of his previous crimes, the State Police would be harmed by not being able to investigate future crimes committed by Hunt. Furthermore, the State Police contends, because Hunt’s ex-pungement involves “more serious sexual offenses within the context of duties placed on the state police in its recordkeeping and investigative capacity,” that it is distinguishable from the situation in <em>J.H. </em>in which expungement concerned a summary conviction. State Police Brief at 16. Finally, the State Police asserts standing should be granted because it is aggrieved by the Commonwealth Court’s order imposing attorney’s fees.</p>

Hunt emphasizes the arguments advanced by the State Police in <em>J.H., </em>and rejected therein, are the same arguments it makes in the appeal <em>sub judice. </em>As no compelling reasons are present to overrule <em>J.H., </em>and circumstances have not changed, Hunt asserts our decision in <em>J.H. </em>requires affirmance of the Commonwealth Court’s order. Furthermore, Hunt counters the State Police’s argument that this matter arises in a procedurally distinguishable fashion that grants it standing, by pointing to our Court’s conclusion in <em>J.H. </em>that “standing is not conferred via a party’s relationship to the proceedings.” <em>J.H., </em><a href="/pa/563/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="563 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1366922" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0248-01">563 Pa. at 253</a>, <a href="/a2d/759/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="759 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="11235675,1366922" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/1269-01,/pa/563/0248-01">759 A.2d at 1271</a>.

This different procedural posture is not, as the majority states, “a distinction without a difference.” Majority Op., at 171, 983 A.2d at 636.

    <p id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[289,1796,1156,573]]]'>As the State Police is a party to mandamus and summary relief actions, there is a clear causal connection between the action complained of (its refusal to comply with the expungement order) and the injury to the person challenging it (Hunt’s inability to expunge his criminal record). Surely the State Police, as keeper of the criminal records, has a substantial interest and is thus aggrieved by the order, particularly as it has been ordered to pay attorney’s fees. It appears anomalous to suggest it cannot be heard on a matter which directs it to perform an act it perceives as contrary to its statutory duties.</p>

The clerk accordingly lacked authority — and thus, standing — to challenge the order in question.
