Having said that, however, I recognize that our front-line criminal appeals court confronts these sorts of issues on a near-daily basis, and I have no fixed objection to the court undertaking to adopt efficiencies and improvements in order to better serve justice. But this case, in which we disapprove of the Superior Court’s <em>sua sponte </em>review of the sufficiency of a <em>Finley </em>no-merit letter when the defendant has not raised such issue, shows that the Superior Court should proceed cautiously in areas that implicate rulemaking. <em>See Commonwealth v.

This mechanism effectively advances the goal of Pa.R.Crim.P. 907, which provides as follows:</p>

The defendant may respond to the proposed dismissal within 20 days of the date of the notice.

    <p id="b125-4" data-blocks='[["BL_125.4",125,[127,508,1154,895]]]'>The Rule 907 process, in turn, is important for issue preservation purposes. This is so because, as the Majority correctly holds, the <em>Finley </em>appellant, like appellants generally, should be limited to raising issues he actually raised before the PCRA court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower courts are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”); <em>see also </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3) (“To be eligible for relief under th[e PCRA], the petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence ... [t]hat the allegation of error has not been ... waived.”). In my judgment, the fact that indigent PCRA petitioners typically initiate the PCRA process by identifying their complaints in their own <em>pro se </em>filings, when combined with <em>Finley’s </em>command of review by both counsel and the PCRA court and the notice provision in Rule 907, provides more than adequate opportunity for the <em>Finley </em>appellant to preserve any and all appropriate issues for appeal, including complaints about <em>Finley </em>counsel.</p>

PCRA counsel’s <em>Tumer/Finley </em>letter, dated July 22, 2004, was copied to appellee and filed with the court on July 23, 2004. That same day, the case was listed for formal dismissal on August 20, 2004, on which date it was continued to September 30, 2004, with the requisite notice to appellee that it intended to dismiss his petition without a hearing, which the Honorable D. Webster Keogh formally did by order dated September 30, 2004, more than two months after counsel’s <em>Tumer/Finley </em>letter. At no time did appellee respond in any manner, much less advise the court that PCRA counsel had failed to act upon his alleged request to add a claim that plea counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal or that he had requested plea counsel to file an appeal.</p>

In this letter, appellee also claimed that he asked plea counsel to file an appeal but that plea counsel failed to do so. Appellee admitted in this letter that he had failed to raise the issue of his lost direct appeal in his <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition, but then insisted that he requested PCRA counsel to amend his PCRA petition to include a claim that plea counsel denied him his right to direct appeal. I would hold that by this point, it was too late.</p>

The Dissenting Opinion responds that Rule 907 (providing that once PCRA court provides requisite notice of intention to dismiss PCRA petition and states reasons therefor, “[t]he defendant may respond to the proposed dismissal within 20 days of the date of the notice (emphasis added)) does not require that the petitioner respond to the PCRA court’s notice, nor does any other rule or decision of this Court.

Again, the PCRA’s waiver provision makes no exception for allegations of PCRA counsel ineffectiveness. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3).

Ct. Op. at 8. I believe this mistaken notion helped to lead the court astray. I suppose it is only natural for an appellate court to view itself as the center of the legal universe and thus to be puzzled whenever a party does not appeal. But this is a naive and mistaken assumption, especially in a case, such as this one, that was resolved by a guilty plea. A guilty plea severely restricts the universe of claims that may be raised upon appeal — a fact that was conveyed to appellee very forcefully by the trial court here. As the PCRA judge, the experienced and learned D. Webster Keogh, noted in his opinion, “It is well settled that upon entry of a guilty plea, a petitioner waives all defects and defenses except those concerning the validity of the plea, the jurisdiction of the trial court, and the legality of the sentence imposed.” PCRA Ct. Op. at 2 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Guth, </em><a href="/a2d/735/0709-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="735 A.2d 709" data-case-ids="11537495" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0709-01">735 A.2d 709</a>, 711 n. 3 (Pa.Super.1999)). Quoting the record colloquy that the guilty plea court, the Honorable Carolyn E. Temin, had conducted with appellee, Judge Keogh also noted that appellee was specifically informed of this fact — so much so, indeed, that the trial judge concluded with: “[A]s a practical matter, once you plead guilty, that is the end of the case, do you understand that?” <em>Id. </em>at 4 (quoting Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 5/9/03, at 7-10). Of course, this reality does not prevent defendants from seeking to avoid the consequences of their pleas — invariably when they find themselves disappointed with their sentences. The most common way to seek to avoid the effect of a guilty plea is to blame it on counsel. That is the sort of claim that lends itself to collateral attack, not direct review.</p>

It is particularly easy to conceive that <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>a lawyer would not inquire into the absence of the appeal where, as here, her Ghent’s <em>pro se </em>petition never complained that he requested a (futile) appeal, only to have counsel ignore him.</p>

This is, of course, the most common of claims in collateral attacks on guilty pleas: “I lied to the guilty plea court when I said no promises were made to me; my lawyer lied to me in promising me a light sentence; and the two lies vitiate my plea.” Counsel carefully explained in her no-merit letter why the claim indeed was frivolous. Judge Keogh concurred, trenchantly noting that appellee was specifically informed by Judge Temin that he faced up to 120 years in prison, and that appellee declared, on the record, that no one promised him anything to secure his plea. <em>See </em>PCRA Ct.

As explained in detail <em>infra, </em>this position is consistent with the controlling case law of this Court. The contrary view adopted by the Majority, which requires Appellee to challenge PCRA counsel’s stewardship during the ongoing proceeding before the PCRA court, is so obviously unworkable that it should finally be put to rest.

Rather, on July 23, 2004, PCRA counsel filed a no-merit letter pursuant to <em>Commonwealth v.

She further concluded that there were no other issues which could have been raised in a counseled amended PCRA petition, and sought leave to withdraw from the case.

The Majority rejects the notion that Appellee’s appeal to the <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>Superior Court was his first occasion to challenge PCRA counsel’s performance, and states that Appellee “could have challenged PCRA counsel’s stewardship after receiving counsel’s withdrawal letter and the notice of the PCRA court’s intent to dismiss his petition pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907, yet he failed to do so.” Op. at 9-10 n. 4, 981 A.2d at 880 n. 4. As Appellee cogently notes, however, our criminal procedural rules do not suggest that a PCRA petitioner’s failure to respond to a Rule 907 dismissal notice renders claims waived for appellate review. Instead, Rule 907 provides that once the PCRA court provides the requisite notice of the intention to dismiss the PCRA petition and states the reasons for the dismissal, “[t]he defendant may respond to the proposed dismissal within 20 days of the date of the notice.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Thus, according to the plain text of Rule 907, a petitioner’s filing of a response to a dismissal notice is optional. As there is absolutely no language in the criminal rules or in the case law of this Court indicating that a petitioner must file a response to the PCRA court’s notice of dismissal or risk waiver of his claims, Appellee cannot be faulted for failing to follow a nonexistent procedure.</p>
