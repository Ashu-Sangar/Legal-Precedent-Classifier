We conclude that the two offenses are not equivalent. As a result, we hold that the Superior Court did not err in concluding that a New York conviction for Arson in the Third Degree cannot serve as a prior crime of violence under Section 9714(a)(1).

Prior to sentencing, the Commonwealth sought application of Section 9714(a), which provides for a mandatory minimum sentence in the event a defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence. The Commonwealth’s request was based on Appellee’s prior conviction in New York for Arson in the Third Degree after he set fire to a building called Main Street Auto. The Three Strikes Law includes among its list of crimes of violence “arson as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3301(a)” or “an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(g). The trial court agreed that the mandatory minimum set forth in Section 9714 applied and ultimately sentenced Appellee to 30 to 60 years in prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Both the statute’s structure and its plain language demonstrate that for most crimes, the focus is not on the facts underlying a conviction, but rather on the statute that triggered the conviction.

Section 9714 does the same with other crimes, listing either a single type of crime or a specific subsection or subsections of particular crimes, most of which are first-degree felonies. For example, a conviction for voluntary manslaughter, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse qualifies as a crime of violence under Section 9714. Two of seven aggravated assault subsections are included in the definition (18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1) and (2) — both first-degree felonies) and three of five robbery subsections (18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(1)®, (ii), and (iii) — all felonies of the first degree) make the list.</p>

      <em>Shaw </em>was not this Court’s first opportunity to consider the proper approach to determining equivalence of offenses. Indeed, the root of our jurisprudence in this area extends to the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Bolden, </em><a href="/pa-super/367/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="367 Pa. Super. 333" data-case-ids="682695" data-case-paths="/pa-super/367/0333-01">367 Pa.Super. 333</a>, <a href="/pa-super/367/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="367 Pa. Super. 333" data-case-ids="682695" data-case-paths="/pa-super/367/0333-01">532 A.2d 1172</a> (1987). In <em>Bolden, </em>the defendant had a prior conviction for attempted burglary in Colorado. After his convictions in Pennsylvania for burglary, attempted rape, indecent assault, and simple assault, the trial court determined, for purposes of calculating Bolden’s prior record score under the Sentencing Guidelines, that the Colorado attempted burglary conviction was equivalent to Bolden’s conviction for attempted burglary under 18 Pa.C.S. § 903 (criminal attempt). <em>See </em>204 Pa.Code § 303.7(d) (“A prior out-of-state or Federal conviction ..., or a prior conviction . .. under former Pennsylvania law, is scored as a conviction for the current equivalent Pennsylvania offense.”) (emphasis added). On appeal to the Superior Court, Bolden argued that the trial court’s equivalence determination was a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines. In upholding the trial court’s equivalence determination, the Superior Court reasoned as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.6",670,[338,1564,1115,622]],["BL_671.1",671,[189,346,1114,418]]]'>In assessing the quality of a prior conviction in a foreign jurisdiction, we discern from the purpose and language of the guidelines that it was the intent of the Sentencing Commission as well as the legislature that offense equivalency be considered in terms of the nature and definition of the offense in light of the record of the foreign conviction. This approach requires a sentencing court to carefully review the elements of the foreign offense in terms of the classification of the conduct proscribed, its definition of the offense, and the requirements for culpability. Accordingly, the court may want to discern whether the crime is <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum, </em>or whether the crime is incho<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>ate or specific. If it is a specific crime, the court- may look to the subject matter sought to be protected by the statute, <em>e.g. </em>protection of the person or protection of property. It will also be necessary to examine the definition of the conduct or activity proscribed. In doing so, the court should identify the requisite elements of the crime— the <em>actus retís </em>and <em>mens rea </em>— which form the basis of liability.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[187,794,1113,744]]]'>Having identified these elements of the foreign offense, the court should next turn its attention to the Pennsylvania Crimes Code for the purpose of determining the equivalent Pennsylvania offense. An equivalent offense is that which is substantially identical in nature and definition as the out-of-state or federal offense when compared with [the] Pennsylvania offense. The record of the foreign conviction will be relevant also when it is necessary to grade the offense under Pennsylvania law or when there are aggravating circumstances. Where there is no equivalent offense, the prior foreign conviction is scored as a current Pennsylvania non-weapons misdemeanor in accordance with section 303.7(h). 204 Pa.Code § 303.7(h) (relating to incomplete prior records for Pennsylvania convictions).</blockquote>
