Under the circumstances here presented, we reach the following conclusions: (1) the labor organization representing the judiciary’s employees has standing in this matter; (2) the county, in establishing its budget, did not encroach on the judiciary’s constitutional right to hire, fire, and supervise its employees; (3) the judiciary did not contravene the county’s legislative budget-making function by <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>settling the grievances; (4) the judiciary’s constitutional right to hire, fire, and supervise its employees was violated when the salary board eliminated five trial court employee positions; and (5) the county committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to implement the grievance settlements.

The Association challenges the Commonwealth Court’s decision upholding the PLRB’s dismissal of its unfair labor practice charge arising from the County’s refusal to implement the grievance settlements by reinstating the five terminated trial court employees. The Association raises two issues: whether the Association had standing to grieve the elimination of the five trial court employee positions and enforce the grievance settlements, which, it alleges, arose out of a dispute concerning the interpretation of the CBA; and whether the County committed an unfair labor practice by failing to implement the grievance settlements directing the reinstatement of the five trial court employees.

Moreover, the Association alleges that while the Salary Board eliminated the positions to implement the County’s budget, the budget did not require the elimination of five trial court employee positions. Citing to a Commissioner’s testimony before the PLRB, in which he acknowledged that there were alternative ways to eliminate employees, the Association states that the terminations were made “arbitrarily” while other avenues of cost reduction were available to the County. The Association emphasizes that the County, in fact, reinstated the trial court employees on August 30, 2004, without raising taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>
      <em>See supra </em>note 8.

The PLRB disagrees with the Association’s allegation that the reinstatement of the terminated employees did not necessitate additional tax dollars because the funding for the positions could have come from other sources within the County. Indeed, the PLRB claims, it is always the case that trial court positions may be funded by reducing allocations to other departments but that allocation decision is a legislative function. The PLRB contends that the disagreement regarding adequate funding of the Judiciary implicates the separation of powers doctrine and therefore cannot be resolved through collective bargaining and the filing of an unfair labor practice charge.

The PLRB and County assert that the Association lacks standing to challenge the elimination of the five trial court employee positions because the grievances were improper backdoor attempts to force the County to increase budget allocations to the Judiciary through the collective bargaining process, a function exclusive to the Judiciary via an action in mandamus. However, the Association was not seeking to compel the County to provide the Judiciary with more funding. Rather, the Association appropriately grieved, pursuant to the CBA, the elimination of the five trial court employees’ positions as a contravention of the CBA. After prevailing during the grievance process, the Association properly sought to remedy the County’s refusal to comply with the grievance settlements through the existing administrative process within the collective bargaining relationship, by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the PLRB. Consequently, the Association certainly maintains standing to represent its employees in the appellate litigation ensuing from the PLRB’s Final Order.</p>

Their briefs appropriately contain only peripheral advocacy on whether the Salary Board’s decision violates the constitutional power of the judiciary to hire, fire, and control its employees. I am troubled by rendering constitutional decisions on matters tangential to the question accepted for review; sweeping statements should not be made <em>in dicta </em>and without the benefit of proper advocacy.</p>

The budget given the judiciary is based on the stated needs of that branch — it is not a grand, unallocated total accepted by the funding body on faith, from which the court can allocate specific funds as it sees fit. Indeed, the Salary Board alone has authority to set the pay of all judicial employees. <em>See </em>16 P.S. § 1623 (Salary Board sets compensation for court-appointed but county-paid employees).</p>

One may safely assume that the predominant component of the judiciary’s budget in Jefferson County is the same as in every county and indeed this Court’s own budget — personnel costs. The Salary Board decided the judiciary’s share of the shortfall required the termination of five court employees, and the President Judge ultimately decided which five employees would be let go for want of funds to pay them. Further, speculation about “other options” the judiciary may have had is just that — pure speculation, which is not part of this record, and statements about what might have been cannot be based on such unfounded assumptions.</p>
