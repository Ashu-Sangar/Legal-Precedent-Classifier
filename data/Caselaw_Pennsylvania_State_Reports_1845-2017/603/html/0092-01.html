At about 1:00 p.m. that day, Appellant, who was home baby-sitting Marlee, called 911 and reported that she had passed out. When EMTs arrived, they observed that the child’s skin showed cyanosis, and that she had significant bruising on her abdomen, chest, arms, legs, neck, and face, she did not have a discernible heartbeat, and was not breathing. The EMTs asked Appellant what had happened 'to the child and he told them that he had just awakened and found her in that condition. He then added that she had fallen. The EMTs tried, unsuccessfully, to revive the child for thirty minutes and then took her to Sunbury Community Hospital where additional efforts were made to revive her. Although doctors were able to restore some vital functions, Marlee did not regain consciousness. Marlee was then flown by helicopter to Geisinger Medical Center where she died the next morning having never regained consciousness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Ms. Goodeliunas hurried home and as she entered the residence, Appellant began apologizing to her, saying repeatedly, “I’m so sorry baby.” In addition, Ms. Goodeliunas received a telephone call from Appellant after he had been taken to police headquarters during which he stated, “Do you <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>think I would put myself at risk for going to jail for the rest of my life for manslaughter?”</p>

Appellant also wrote that Marlee had fallen off a small play table earlier that morning and had complained that she felt dizzy and had pains in her stomach. Appellant added that he entered the living room and panicked when he found Marlee unconscious. Appellant stated he immediately splashed some water on her and then placed her in the bathtub but when that failed to resuscitate her, he called 911.</p>

Appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and provided a statement wherein he admitted that he had beaten the child to death (the “December 9 Statement”). In the December 9 Statement, Appellant said that he was home watching Marlee and became angry because <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>she said that she did not want to be there with Appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> As a result, he slapped the child in the face.</p>

Afterwards Marlee said to Appellant that she felt sorry for him. When he asked why, she said, “Because you’re mean.” Upon hearing Marlee’s response, Appellant said he “snapped” and punched Marlee in the stomach with a closed fist and kicked her in her stomach or back, which caused her to fall to the floor. He then kicked her several times more in her stomach and back and also punched her as she lay on the floor. Marlee asked him to stop and tried to stand. She was unable to get to her feet and fell back to the floor where she was struck some more by Appellant. According to the December 9 Statement, Marlee eventually got up and ran into a bedroom where Appellant punched her again and caused her to fall; he continued to kick and punch her. The beating, Appellant stated, continued even though Marlee pleaded for him to stop.</p>

After 15-20 minutes, he noticed that she was no longer moving or breathing so he placed her lifeless body in a tub of cold water in an attempt to resuscitate her. When this failed to revive Marlee, Appellant took her from the tub, called 911, and began to perform CPR on her. Appellant admitted that he had used <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>drugs the previous evening, but stated that he was not “high” when the beating occurred.</p>

When she began asking Appellant why he was giving her a bath because he was not her father, Appellant again “lost it” and began hitting Marlee for about two and one half to three minutes. He then bathed her and when he finished and was drying her off, Marlee began repeating that Appellant was mean and was not her father.

He testified that when he gave his statements, he had no recollection of the incident, and that as time passed he remembered more of it. He blamed the incident on a loss of control precipitated by Marlee’s statements that she did not like him. Appellant testified that he did not intend to kill Marlee.</p>
