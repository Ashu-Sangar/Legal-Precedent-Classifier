    <p id="b447-5" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[147,995,1156,727]]]'>Prior to appellant’s rehearing, President Judge Black became aware that appellant had never been sentenced by Judge Mellenberg for any of the non-capital offenses of which he was convicted in 1988 along with the first-degree murder charge. Appellant then filed a motion for immediate sentencing in which he waived his right to challenge his ultimate sentences on the non-capital offenses based on the fact of the Commonwealth’s failure to request timely sentencing. <em>See </em>Pa. R.Crim.P. 704(A)(1) (requiring generally that sentences be imposed within 90 days of conviction or entry of plea of guilty or <em>nolo </em>contendere). Judge Black, however, declined to sentence appellant for the non-capital offenses prior to completion of the penalty rehearing for the first-degree murder conviction.</p>

Specifically, the Commonwealth agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for appellant’s agreement to: (1) accept a life sentence for his first-degree murder conviction as well as two consecutive maximum sentences of ten to twenty years’ im<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>prisonment for his robbery and burglary convictions; and (2) waive his post-sentence and appellate rights with respect to these sentences, including the right to seek clemency. Thereafter, appellant signed and submitted to the court a lengthy written colloquy detailing the terms of the sentencing agreement. A lengthy oral colloquy was conducted with appellant, after which Judge Black, in conformity with the agreement, sentenced appellant on August 13, 2007 to life imprisonment and two consecutive prison terms of ten to twenty years.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[298,838,1152,902]]]'>Notwithstanding the above agreement, appellant filed a post-sentence motion challenging his August 13, 2007 judgment of sentence. Noting that appellant specifically waived his appellate rights in the sentencing agreement, Judge Black dismissed the motion, and appellant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of sentence in the Superior Court on September 12, 2007. In his Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, Judge Black set forth his findings that appellant knowingly entered into the sentencing agreement and that he “received a valuable <em>quid pro quo </em>from the Commonwealth in that the Commonwealth spared him a trial before a jury that may well have imposed the death penalty, as did the jury that had previously heard this case.” Trial Ct. Op., 10/22/07, at 4; <em>see also id. </em>at 5 (noting that “[d]ue process does not mean perpetual process over and over and over again”).

In particular, appellant asserts that, because he was not sentenced on the robbery and burglary convictions until August 13, 2007, those sentences are illegal and he was never afforded the right to a direct appeal from those convictions. In addition, appellant asserts that the sentencing agreement is invalid because it required him to waive his appellate rights and because, by requiring him to waive his right to seek clemency, it impermissibly bound the Governor, who was not a party to the agreement.
