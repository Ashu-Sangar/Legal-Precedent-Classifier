Appellants suggest that discovery proceedings in the underlying lawsuits in which the medical records were requested are the sole form of relief envisioned by the legislature in drafting the MRA. They argue that the MRA does not provide for a private cause of action to enforce the statutory price limits and that Appellee is merely seeking to circumvent the statute “through the artifice of pleading” a breach of contract.

Appellants appear to confuse two doctrines: exhaustion of administrative remedies and preference of statutory remedies over the common law. Even if Appellants’ argument were clear, however, we would not afford Appellants relief under either theory. First, where the MRA does not create any administrative process, <em>i.e., </em>an administrative agency to which Appellee would have had to resort before filing suit on its breach of contract claim, the obligation to exhaust administrative remedies does not apply. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6151-6160; <em>see Ohio Cas.

In addition, the legislature did not provide any mechanism or procedure for the resolution of disputes in circumstances where the MRA is violated by designated agents of the hospitals, like Appellants. As noted above, the purpose of the MRA is to eliminate the requirement for preliminary testimony when litigants introduce certified copies of medical records at trial and other judicial proceedings. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6151. The MRA also establishes a procedure for obtaining the certified copies of records from medical care providers, such as hospitals. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a). Appellants are correct to posit that Appellee would have to file discovery motions with the trial court if it wished to enforce a subpoena for medical records against a hospital. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a)(1).

Indeed, they falsely represented that the copies were from microfilm by using the term “fiche.” Appellee typically discovered the overcharges after the underlying lawsuits for which the records were requested had ended and there was no longer any opportunity to file motions with the trial judge. Even if the overcharge had been discovered before litigation ended, Appellee could not have obtained relief <em>via </em>the subpoena enforcement mechanism because Appellants were not named in the subpoenas for records. Indeed, Appellants have not suggested any viable means of enforcing the MRA’s price limitations other than through a common law cause of action such as the present one. According to the rules of statutory interpretation, the trial court properly allowed the instant lawsuit to proceed, especially because it was essential to effectuate the legislature’s intent to make Appellants subject to the pricing limits of the MRA. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1504, 1921; <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a)(2).</p>

Appellants claim that each member of the class agreed to the price term stated in the invoice so that they may not argue they were overcharged. Appellants’ Brief at 40.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[291,828,1152,777]]]'>As our previous analysis shows, Appellants start from the wrong assumption. Here, as to each member of the class, the existence of a contract is implied from the parties’ conduct. <em>See supra </em>at 8; <em>Elias, </em><a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="237 A.2d 215">237 A.2d at 217</a>; <em>Eagle, </em><a href="/pa-super/412/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="412 Pa.

The parties’ conduct also indicates that they intended the MRA to supply the price; the price varied depending on the nature of the records copied. The invoices are additional proof that such contracts existed and that the price term was meant, to be governed by the MRA, as the billing rates tracked the MRA (though misrepresenting the type of record copied). Thus, whether the parties formed a contract and to what price they agreed is not, as Appellants suggest, an individual inquiry into the content of the invoices. Rather, it is a uniform inquiry into the conduct of Appellants which is common to all the members of the class.</p>

Appellants claim that whether each member of the class can obtain relief depends on whether each can prove that they “relied” on Appellants’ description of electronic records as “fiche.” We recognize that the class stated several causes of action arising from Appellants’ misrepresentations, including for breach of contract, fraud, and a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL). The trial court, however, dismissed the fraud and UTPCPL claims of the class on preliminary objections and allowed only the breach of contract claim to proceed.

According to Appellants, each member of the class must prove it “did not know that the quoted term violated the MRA” so as to obtain relief for breach of contract. Appellants’ Reply Brief at 16. As we noted above, the doctrine of “voluntary payment” does not bar Appellee’s claims because, when it paid, Appellee did not know that it was paying for copies from electronic and not microfilm records.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> All other members of the class were in the same position as Appellee, having received misleading bills.

Here, all class members suffered damages when they were overbilled and paid those bills. It is a separate matter whether any class members who passed along improperly augmented copying costs to their clients will ultimately be required to indemnify those clients upon recovery in the present litigation. Indeed, it is notable that Appellee conceded during proceedings in the court of common pleas that such class members would, in fact, have such a duty of indemnification. N.T., 05/03/2004, 72.
