At approximately 3:00 a.m. on January 31, 2006, Officer Nicholas Hine, Sr. of the Cumru Township Police Department, on patrol in the Borough of Kenhorst, Berks County, Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> observed a maroon 1988 Ford Aerostar van travelling on New Holland Road. The van was heading toward Nolde Forest, a wooded public park and operating without its headlights illuminated. Based upon this violation of the Motor Vehicle Code, Officer Hine activated his overhead lights in an attempt to stop the van. The van made numerous evasive turns through the streets and alleyways of Kenhorst before ultimately coming to a stop.</p>

After being ordered twice to return to his vehicle, Appellant returned to the van. Officer Hine radioed for assistance. While waiting for the backup officers to arrive, Officer Hine observed through the window of the van what <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>appeared to be a human leg with a peace sign tattooed on the skin, with a white sneaker on the foot. After observing this body, Officer Hine instructed Appellant, through the P.A. system of his patrol car, for Appellant to turn off the engine of the van and throw the key out of the window with his left hand. The key was on a ring with a “Jello” key fob. Officer Hine also noticed that a piece of plastic was broken off of the van’s bumper. Shortly thereafter, Officer Hine was joined by Sergeant Scott Bechtel and Officer James Griffith.</p>
    <p id="b743-5" data-blocks='[["BL_743.4",743,[144,834,1156,676]]]'>As the officers approached the van, Sergeant Bechtel observed a large, approximately 400-pound white male, later determined to be Kristofer Kolesnik, lying in the back of the van. Kolesnik was wrapped in a large white sheet or tarp which was tied with yellow electrical cord. There appeared to be blood on Kolesnik’s chest and on the sheet, and he did not appear to be breathing. After directing Appellant to exit the vehicle and lie on the ground, Officer Hine asked if there was anyone else in the van, to which Appellant responded, “just a dead guy,” or “only the dead guy.” N.T., 8/6/07, at 59, 106. Subsequently, EMS personnel who were summoned to the scene confirmed Kolesnik was not breathing and had no heartbeat, and determined that he was dead.</p>
    <p id="b743-6" data-blocks='[["BL_743.5",743,[142,1537,1155,625]]]'>Also at this time, Officer Hine and Sergeant Bechtel observed a red gasoline can placed on the front passenger seat, which was later determined to be full of gasoline. Additionally, Sergeant Bechtel saw a Motorola cellular telephone lying in the center console of the van. After Appellant was taken into custody, Sergeant Bechtel noticed blood on Appellant’s pant leg, boot, wrist watch, and glasses. The officers transported Appellant to the Cumru Township Police Department. There, Appellant was placed in a holding cell and instructed not to wash his hands in the sink. Later, however, Appellant was observed by a surveillance camera, dunking his hands into the toilet bowel and rubbing them together.</p>

Investigators were dispatched to Appellant’s residence to search for pieces of broken bumper <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>from the van, which had been impounded after the removal of the victim’s body. Upon his arrival at Appellant’s residence, Sergeant Guy Lehman of the Reading Police Department observed fresh blood leading from the sidewalk to the front door of the residence, and a wooden broom with blood on it, on the sidewalk. Based upon his observation of what he believed to be fresh blood spread across the front of the residence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and his fear that there may have been other victims inside the residence who may require medical attention, Sergeant Lehman called for assistance and determined that it was prudent to conduct a security check of the residence.</p>

Investigator Strickler knocked on the front door of the residence. Initially, there was no response. After knocking a second time, Investigator Strickler heard a faint muffled voice coming from inside the residence. Investigator Strickler pushed open the front door, and three officers entered the residence. The officers proceeded room-by-room in search of individuals in the apartment. The officers checked a living room, a kitchen, a rear bathroom, and a bedroom where they encountered William Galvin, Appellant’s father, who was lying on a bed. Appellant’s father was not injured or in need of medical care. The officers explained why they were in the apartment, gave him an opportunity to dress, and then escorted him from the apartment so that the security check could be completed.</p>

Additionally, the search uncovered a Brinks lock box, which was located underneath the bed in Appellant’s bedroom.

Three days later, on January 30, 2006, Wendy Hess, the victim’s girlfriend with whom he lived, picked up Kolesnik after he finished his shift with the Reading Metro Taxi Company. The two returned to their home in Reading. After eating a meal, Hess and Kolesnik went to bed. When Hess awoke at 1:45 p.m., Kolesnik was gone and had evidently taken Hess’ maroon van with him. In the interim, at approximately 12:15 p.m., Kolesnik went to the A-Plus minimarket on Perki<a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>omen Avenue where he was confronted by Appellant regarding the return of a cellular telephone.</p>

On August 13, 2007, the jury found the aggravating circumstance that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(9). The jury also found as a mitigating circumstance that Appellant committed three of his prior felonies when he was a juvenile. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8). The jury concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance and rendered a verdict of death. On September 6, 2007, the trial court formally sentenced Appellant to death and a consecutive, aggregate sentence of no less than 5 nor more than 11 years’ imprisonment for the convictions for abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, and theft by unlawful taking. The trial court imposed no further sentence on the remaining crimes. On September 27, 2007, Appellant filed a notice of appeal, and, on March 13, 2008, the trial court rendered its 1925(a) opinion, denying Appellant relief.

Specifically, Appellant offers that there is no evidence to establish either that he killed Kolesnik or that he had the specific intent to kill. No testimony placed him at his residence when Kolesnik was shot, and similarly, no evidence established that Appellant owned a gun or fired a gun as there was no residue found on his clothing or person. Moreover, evidence suggested that Kolesnik had a long history of heroin addiction and that he was despondent over his inability to be free from this addiction. Appellant avers that Dr. Land, who testified on behalf of the Commonwealth, could not tell from the observation of Kolesnik’s body whether or not the gunshot wound was self-inflicted. According to Appellant, while Kolesnik’s DNA was found on Appellant’s watch, this was consistent with Appellant moving the body, but not that he was present when Kolesnik died. Thus, Appellant complains that the <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>evidence was insufficient to uphold the conviction for first-degree murder.</p>
    <p id="b748-4" data-blocks='[["BL_748.4",748,[302,452,1152,678]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that its theory of the murder was that Appellant, upset over circumstances surrounding his brother’s incarceration,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> shot Kolesnik in the head while Kolesnik was in the process of injecting heroin in Appellant’s bedroom. Appellant then loaded Kolesnik’s body into the van, intending to destroy both the body and the vehicle. Conversely, Appellant’s theory was that Kolesnik shot himself in the head after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing. When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, the Commonwealth maintains that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Appellant killed Kolesnik and that Appellant did so with specific intent.</p>

Kolesnik was to go to Appellant’s house later that day to return a cellular telephone-, a source of controversy between the men, and which sparked an argument’ between Kolesnik and Appellant a few days earlier at the same store. The evidence places Kolesnik at Appellant’s residence where DNA analysis matches Kolesnik’s DNA with that of blood on Appellant’s mattress and a bullet. A trail of blood led from Appellant’s residence to the curb. Appellant was stopped while driving a van, operating without the use of headlights, and while heading towards Nolde Forest, a secluded wooded park. When asked by police if anyone else was in the vehicle, Appellant responded, “just a dead guy” or “only the dead guy.” In the cargo area of the van was Kolesnik’s body and on the front passenger seat was a container full of gasoline. Kolesnik’s body was wrapped in a blood-soaked covering, bound with electrical wire, which matched wire recovered from Appellant’s room. Also, located in the vehicle was a cellular telephone belonging to Appellant’s brother. Appellant was observed with blood on his pants, watch, and glasses. The blood on Appellant’s watch matched Kolesnik’s DNA. After being arrested, Appellant was instructed not to wash his hands, yet, Appellant attempted to wash his hands in a toilet bowl in his holding cell. Finally, Commonwealth witness, Dr. Land, an expert in forensic pathology, believed that the circumstances surrounding Kolesnik’s death, combined with the crime scene evidence, strongly suggested a homicide. Dr. Land pointed to the fact that Kolesnik had a ligature still tied around his left arm, consistent with present drug use. As Dr. Land opined, because Kolesnik was right-handed, he would have had to have been shooting drugs into his left arm, yet, the entrance wound was in the left side of Kolesnik’s head. This evidence, coupled with an attempt to hide the murder and the lack of notice to the police of a suicide, all pointed away from suicide and <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>toward a finding of a homicide. Based upon this evidence, we hold that the evidence supports the jury’s conviction of first-degree murder.</p>

While Appellant acknowledges that he was stopped operating Hess’ van and was operating the van with a key attached to Hess’ Jello key fob, according to Appellant, it could be inferred that Kolesnik had permission to use Hess’ van, because Kolesnik and Hess lived together and were boyfriend and girlfriend. Moreover, evidence existed that Kolesnik and Appellant were friends. Appellant maintains that the Commonwealth did not present evidence that he did not have permission from Kolesnik to use the van or that he intended to deprive Hess of the van. Thus, as the evidence fails to establish that he intended to deprive Hess of her van, Appellant claims that the evidence does not support a conviction of theft by unlawful taking.</p>

Furthermore, the Commonwealth submits that circumstantial evidence supported the Commonwealth’s theory, accepted by the jury it contends, that Appellant killed Kolesnik and placed his body into the van with the intent to dispose of both the body and the van. Supporting this view, the Commonwealth notes that a full gasoline container was found on the front passenger seat of the van, and Hess testified that the gasoline container was previously empty in the cargo area of the van and was filled only if the van ran out of gas.</p>

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, with all reasonable inferences drawn there from, and as set forth by the Commonwealth and the trial court, Appellant was found operating Hess’ van, using the only keys to the vehicle, without Hess’ permission. Appellant was driving the van towards a secluded wooded area, Nolde Forest, in the early morning hours without its headlights illuminated. In the cargo area of the van was the body of Hess’ live-in boyfriend, and in the front passenger seat of the van was a container filled with gasoline.

Furthermore, Appellant develops that he voluntarily stopped the van after being ordered to by police, that he was cooperative -with police, and that the van was not taken far from the residence of the owner. According to Appellant, all of these factors suggest the evidence is insufficient to establish that Appellant did not intend to re<a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>store the van to its owner, a necessary requirement to establish the crime of receiving stolen property.</p>

We conclude the evidence of record established the elements of receiving stolen property. Again, Appellant was stopped by police while driving Hess’ van, without her permission, using her keys. Appellant was driving the van, without headlights illuminated, in the direction of Nolde Forest, with Kolesnik’s body, as well as a container filled with gasoline. While Appellant offers a different scenario to explain the course of events, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Appellant retained Hess’ van, knowing it was stolen, and that he did not intend to return the van to Hess.

Specifically, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth’s expert, Dr. Land, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that the cause of death of Kolesnik was a gunshot wound to the head and that the manner of death was homicide. Yet, as Appellant asserts, Dr. Land could not determine, solely by examining the victim’s body, if the manner of death was a suicide or a homicide. Appellant’s expert, Dr. John Shane, an expert in both forensic pathology and toxicology, testified that the manner of death was a suicide, stating that the victim had an extremely high level of opiates in his system, <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>that this constituted a suicide attempt by injecting such a large quantity of opiates.

With respect to both challenges, and similar to his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges, Appellant offers that, as Kolesnik had permission to use the van, he in turn had the authority to give permission to others to use the van. Appellant points out that the Commonwealth failed to provide evidence that the victim did not allow Appellant to use the van, and, therefore, Appellant avers that there was no evidence presented that Appellant was not given permission to use the van by Kolesnik before his death. Furthermore, Appellant maintains he was found operating the van belonging to Hess less than one day after she had last seen the van and he was using the proper key for the vehicle. Thus, Appellant asserts that the weight of the evidence did not support a finding that he did not plan on restoring the van to Hess and that he intended to permanently deprive her of the van.

The jury concluded that Appellant was the perpetrator and that he possessed the requisite specific intent for first-degree murder. While Appellant’s argument focuses on allegedly conflicting testimony by the Commonwealth’s expert and his expert, he fails to acknowledge that the Commonwealth’s expert strongly indicated Kolesnik’s death was a homicide. Moreover, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the defense testimony. <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the affidavits contained the officers’ observations of blood on Appellant’s leg, wrist watch, and glasses. The affidavits also contained the police officers’ observations of fresh blood leading from the front door of Appellant’s residence to the sidewalk, and a blood-covered broom on the <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>sidewalk. Moreover, the affidavits described the officers’ approach to the door to determine if persons were in need of emergency treatment, the hearing of a faint voice, and the officers’ entry into the residence. Finally, the affidavits described the officers’ search for persons within the residence, and the observations of the officers once inside the residence.

In response to Appellant’s ai'gument that the observations of the officers while in his apartment should not have been part of the affidavit, we note that the officers were legally within Appellant’s residence. Police officers are not required to close their eyes to matters in plain view while they are at a legal vantage point. Thus, their observations while in Appellant’s residence were properly considered as part of the affidavits. Furthermore, the information contained in the affidavits in support of the search warrant, even excluding the observations of the police officers while inside Appellant’s residence, was probative — establishing a nexus between Appellant, who was stopped with Kolesnik’s corpse, the fresh blood observed outside of Appellant’s residence leading to the front door of the apartment, and Appellant’s residence. Therefore, based upon the information contained in the affidavits in support of the search warrant, we concluded that the, suppression court properly rejected Appellant’s motion to suppress.</p>

Once the observations made by police are removed from the affidavit, Appellant maintains that there is not probable cause to search the residence. Furthermore, Appellant asserts that the only reference to the lock box was that it was located in Appellant’s bedroom, under the bed where the police observed a pool of blood. Appellant submits that the affidavit of probable cause is devoid of explanation regarding how the items in the lock box are connected to criminal activity or what might be found inside the lock box. Thus, according to Appellant, the items taken from the lock box should be suppressed.</p>

The warrant provided for seizure of, <em>inter alia, </em>ammunition, photographs, records of ownership and occupancy, and any other forensic evidence which may be related to the case. It was reasonable, according to the Commonwealth, that the lock box located under Appellant’s bed, near a fresh pool of blood, would contain any or all of the items listed above. Furthermore, the Commonwealth obtained a second search warrant for the contents of the lock box, which contained prescription bottles, a spoon with residue, a syringe, miscellaneous documents and IDs, a letter from Appellant’s brother, Cory, and assorted coins. As noted above, the suppression court determined that, based upon the circumstances, a lawful security check was fully justified, permitting the officers to legally be in the residence without a search warrant. Thereafter, the police followed the proper procedures in obtaining a valid search warrant to seize, open, and search the lock box.</p>

Furthermore, Appellant had the presence of mind to remove Kolesnik’s body from his residence, wrap and bind the victim’s body, and drive the body toward a secluded wooded area, during which he attempted to elude capture.

While Hess was questioned whether Kolesnik had overdosed previously, she testified only: “He told me that happened. I wasn’t there.” N.T., 8/8/07, at 518. There was no other testimony introduced at trial establishing that an overdose had, in fact, occurred. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the trial court acted within its discretion in precluding the hypothetical question. Similarly, the Commonwealth acknowledges that, with respect to the hypothetical regarding Kolesnik’s rehabilitation efforts, Hess testified that Kolesnik had been in 5 rehabilitation facilities, but always relapsed. Furthermore, Appellant’s brother, Cory Galvin, explained that Kolesnik had expressed desperation over being thrown out of rehabilitation and was unable to lack his heroin addiction. Yet, according to the Commonwealth, the trial court acted within its discretion when it concluded there was insufficient evidence to support any assumptions regarding the time the victim spent in reha<a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>bilitation. As the trial court explained, “such details like the length of Kolesnick’s [sic] time in treatment, the nature of his treatment, and the reasons for being kicked out of rehab would be relevant and likely necessary for Dr. Shane to offer a competent, permissible opinion about the effect, if any, of Kolesnick’s [sic] time in rehab.” Trial Court Opinion, 3/13/08, at 27.

Thus, Appellant failed to make a preliminary showing-sufficient to permit the hypothetical question regarding Kolesnik’s alleged overdose.
