Further, although the legislature expressly qualified “capacity,” it did not qualify “services” to indicate that offering <em>any </em>services at <em>any </em>wages, benefits, or hours would be sufficient to meet the School District’s burden of proof when seeking to avoid paying unemployment benefits under Section 402.1(1). <em>See <a href="/pa/589/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="910 A.2d 38" data-case-ids="2572997,8445293" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0605-01,/a2d/910/0038-01">id.</a> </em>In fact, Section 402.1(1) does not address at all terms and conditions of employment. <em>See <a href="/pa/589/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="910 A.2d 38" data-case-ids="2572997,8445293" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0605-01,/a2d/910/0038-01">id.</a> </em>Without any such relevant language, the School District’s argument that the Regulation is inconsistent with the language of Section 402.1(1) fails.</p>

According to the School District, the Regulation is at odds with the legislative intent of Section 402.1(1) because the purpose of that section is “to <em>eliminate </em>the payment of benefits to school employees during summer months.” School District’s Brief at 18-19 (emphasis in the original) (quoting <em>Haynes v.

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Considered in its entirety, Section 402.1(1) already appears to require economic equivalency to some extent before permitting an employer like the School District to avoid paying unemployment benefits during the summer recess. The section denies benefits to one who performs in one of three capacities during one academic year with reasonable assurance to perform in one of the same three capacities the following year. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 802.1. In other words, if a teacher is to return as a teacher, researcher, or principal administrator of a school she may not receive unemployment benefits. If, however, she returns in a non-instructional, non-research, or non-principal administrative position <em>(i.e., </em>as a member of the custodial staff), she is entitled to benefits. As the Commonwealth Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[340,1083,1112,408]]]'>The intent of the legislature in passing Section 402.1 was to eliminate the payment of benefits to school employees during summer months and other regularly scheduled vacations, on the rationale that such employees are able to anticipate and prepare for these nonworking periods. The law thus recognizes that these employees are not truly unemployed or suffering from economic insecurity during scheduled recesses.</blockquote>

While this statement is generally true with regard to school employees who perform the same services every academic year, its rationale breaks down with respect to school employees like Ms. LiVorio. The decrease in Ms. LiVorio’s income was not caused simply by the summer vacation but by the School District’s decision to offer her a position with fewer hours, salary, and benefits. <em>Cf.

The first stated goal is humanitarian: to provide “[sjecurity against unemployment and the spread of indigency.” 43 P.S. § 752 (Declaration of public policy). The Regulation extends unemployment benefits to persons who have suffered a loss of income. The Act’s second stated and equally important goal is to cooperate fully with USDOL so as “to secure to this Commonwealth and its citizens all advantages available under the provisions of the Social Security Act that relate to unemployment compensation.” 43 P.S. § 767(a)(1). As the Department’s Bulletin publication recounts, USDOL notified the Commonwealth of its failure to conform to federal law in its interpretation of “reasonable assurances.” <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Pa.%20Bull.%2025" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="33 Pa.

The School District’s reading of Section 402.1(1) coincides with the Commonwealth Court's interpretation pre-dating the Regulation. In promulgating the Regulation, the Department was not bound by the <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>Commonwealth Court’s interpretation. <em>Elite, </em><a href="/pa/574/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="832 A.2d 428" data-case-ids="587975,9086782" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0476-01,/a2d/832/0428-01">832 A.2d at 431</a> (holding that "past interpretation of a statute, though approved by the judiciary, does not bind the [agency] to that particular interpretation”). The Commonwealth Court has applied the Regulation on several occasions after its adoption without striking it as invalid. <em>See, e.g., Carlynton Sch. Dist. v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em><a href="/a2d/929/0680-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="929 A.2d 680" data-case-ids="8355432" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/0680-01">929 A.2d 680</a> (Pa.Commw.2007); <em>Glassmire v.

In <em>Zielinski, </em>a full-time teacher for the 2001-02 school year was offered <em>per diem </em>substitute work for the 2002-03 academic year and sought unemployment benefits for the fall semester 2002. <a href="/a2d/834/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="834 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="9084550" data-case-paths="/a2d/834/1225-01">834 A.2d at 1227-28</a>. The referee denied benefits based on Section 402.1(1) although the claimant had not sought benefits for the summer recess, and the UCBR affirmed. <em><a href="/a2d/834/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="834 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="9084550" data-case-paths="/a2d/834/1225-01">Id.</a> </em>The Commonwealth Court reversed the decision of the UCBR and held that the claimant was entitled to benefits under Section 4(u) of the Act, which defined "unemployed.” <em><a href="/a2d/834/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="834 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="9084550" data-case-paths="/a2d/834/1225-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/834/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="834 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="9084550" data-case-paths="/a2d/834/1225-01">at 1229</a>.

Yet, the Commonwealth Court denied Ms. LiVorio benefits. The two results appear inconsistent in view of the stated purposes of the Act, <em>i.e. </em>to provide "[sjecurity against unemployment and the spread of indigency.” 43 P.S. § 752.</p>
