Pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3803(b)(2), an individual who violates Section 3802(c) and has no prior offenses commits a misdemeanor punishable by not more than six months' incarceration. Pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 3803(b)(1), an individual who violates Section 3802(b) and has no more than one prior offense commits a misdemeanor punishable by not more than six months' incarceration. Under the circumstances of this case, both offenses are graded as misdemeanors pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 3803(b)(1) and (2), punishable by not more than six months' incarceration.

The legislature does not explain why the Vehicle Code contains different definitions of “prior offense.” We note, however, that there are provisions within and outside of Chapter 38 of the Vehicle Code that refer specifically to either Section 3806(a) or Section 3806(b) for their distinct definitions of “prior offense.” For instance, Section 3805 (ignition interlock) specifically provides that for an individual seeking restoration of driving privileges, the definition of prior offense to be applied for purposes of the ten-year look-back period is the definition provided in Section 3806(a). In 75 Pa.C.S. § 1553(d.l), pertaining to adjudication eligibility for obtaining an occupational limited license, the legislature specifically provided that the definition of prior offense provided in subsection 3806(a) was to be applied; while in 75 Pa.C.S. § 1553(d.2), pertaining to suspension eligibility for obtaining an occu<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>pational limited license, the legislature specifically directed that "prior offense,” as it is defined in subsection 3806(b), is to be applied. 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1553(d.l) and (d.2)(l)(iii). In addition, Section 3814(2) contains its own, and completely different, “prior offense” component, without any reference to Section 3806. Thus, the legislature, for whatever reason, intended that different definitions of “prior offense” be applied to different circumstances addressed in the Vehicle Code.</p>

The defendant in <em>Nieves </em>had pled guilty on the same day to two DUI offenses that had occurred six months apart, and had been sentenced separately on each offense at a later date. The Superior Court concluded that because conviction on one offense had occurred prior to sentencing on the other offense, the prior "violation” was properly considered a "prior offense” for grading and sentencing purposes pursuant to Section 3806(a). <em>Nieves, supra </em>at 889.
