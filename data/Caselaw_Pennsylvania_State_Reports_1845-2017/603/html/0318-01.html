Appellant did not forward an equal protection argument in his brief on direct appeal. To the extent appellant recasts or supplements the argument he actually made on appeal by, for example, adding the new equal protection claim, the argument is waived and an inappropriate subject of reargument.</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[294,1579,1153,792]]]'>Appellant’s second claim poses that, in our independent statutory review of the record for passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factors respecting the death sentence imposed, this Court “overlooked” an inconsistency in the record that, appellant now claims for the first time, establishes that his death sentence was arbitrary. Specifically, appellant claims that, in a pre-trial <em>Atkins </em>hearing addressing whether he was eligible for a death sentence given his level of intellectual functioning, the lower court found as a fact that he had a full scale I.Q. level of 61-71 which, he argues, is within the range of intellectual functioning consistent with mental retardation. Appellant asserts that this pre-trial ruling “was also a binding factual finding” upon the jury, which established inherently mitigating evidence, yet the jury failed to give mitigating effect to the evidence.</p>

Appellant nevertheless poses a novel theory of issue preservation, tied to this Court’s statutory review of capital sentences on direct appeal, which we will discuss below. In order to understand the operation of the issue preservation theory, it is first necessary to examine the claim. Examination of the record for that purpose, however, unfortunately reveals that counsel has flatly misrepresented the relevant facts to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[151,959,1152,312]]]'>Appellant’s current argument is bottomed upon two factual assertions: first, that the trial court made a binding factual finding in his favor; and second, that the jury failed to honor that binding determination, which implies that the jury was asked or told to honor the finding.

In its Opinion and Order of January 24, 2007, the trial court correctly noted that, to prove that he was mentally retarded, appellant was required to establish three points: limited intellectual function (an I.Q. level of approximately 70 or below), significant adaptive limitations, and onset before age eighteen. <em>See Commonwealth v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="585 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="2473196" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01">585 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d 624</a>, 630 (2005).

Instead, the record reflects that appellant’s expert testified and described appellant’s I.Q. level as “borderline mentally retarded,” in the “upper limit or mildly mentally retarded, lower limit of normal,” and “at the borderline between mildly mentally retarded and low normal I.Q.” Notes of Testimony, 2/12/07, at 119, 120, 138. In her closing to the sentencing jury, appellant’s penalty phase counsel referred in passing to “his mental abilities, his organic brain damage,” and his “mental limitations.” <em>Id. </em>at 170, 173, 175, <a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d 624</a>. Counsel then argued two mitigating circumstances to the sentencing jury: (1) that appellant’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired; and (2) appellant’s background and character, including his mental impairment and organic brain damage. Counsel did not argue to the jury that the trial judge had made a finding that bound the jury respecting part of the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation; counsel requested no charge to that effect; and counsel did not object to the absence of any such <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>charge. In delineating for the jury the mitigating circumstances presented by appellant, the trial court stated that appellant was pursuing the catchall mitigator and then listed, among the factors that the jury could consider, appellant’s alleged mental impairment and organic brain damage. <em>See id. </em>at 182, <a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d 624</a>. Thus, evidence and argument arising from appellant’s claim of mental impairment was placed before the jury, but it was not remotely the issue appellant now claims was presented to, and wrongly ignored by, the jury.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[139,825,1154,1218]]]'>Current counsel uses strong words to condemn the jury, alleging that it acted “arbitrarily,” in “clear derogation of the jury’s statutory and constitutional obligation to consider and give effect to relevant mitigating evidence that had been proven by the defense.” Application at 9. Appellant further declares that the jury’s “failure to find and weigh the inherently mitigating evidence of Appellant’s impaired mental functioning clearly violated the Eighth Amendment.” <em>Id. </em>at 10. But, in fact, the only derogation of duty here involves counsel’s present misrepresentation of the record to this Court. The blatant, multiple material misrepresentations of the record that undergird the instant Application are beyond distressing. Perhaps even more inexplicable is the fact that counsel on reargument, who did not sign the direct appeal brief, in fact represented appellant at the penalty phase, and so she should be well aware of what actually occurred at that proceeding. For counsel to then re-enter the case and sign a pleading on reargument that seeks to present an entirely new issue, but is premised upon “facts” invented from whole cloth, is beyond the pale. Counsel should be mindful of her ethical duties, including her duty of candor toward the tribunal, which prohibits an attorney from knowingly making a false statement of material fact. Pa.R.P.C. 3.3(a)(1).</p>

Appellant argues that this Court erred in “overlooking” his claim when conducting our statutory review of the record, and that the claim is “not capable of waiver” under Pennsylvania law, given our statute<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>ry review of death sentences. Specifically, appellant argues that this Court’s statutory review obliges the Court “to address all constitutional issues the Court perceives as present, whether or not raised on appeal by the defendant.” Application at 7 n. 1. Appellant thus suggests that this Court’s statutory review of a death sentence impliedly exhausts all penalty-related constitutional claims, irrespective of whether the claims were argued to the Court or were discussed in the Court’s decision; and if we “overlook” such a claim, he can pursue it for the first time upon reargument. We reject this novel theory.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[295,937,1154,1049]]]'>The statutory review encompassed by Section 9711 (h)(3)(i) authorizes this Court to identify and raise claims concerning a death sentence that we perceive from our review of the record, in narrow circumstances where it appears that the sentence of death is a “product of passion, prejudice or an arbitrary factor.” Not all claims of error, or even all claims of constitutional error, implicate passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness. (Appellant’s claim that the statute authorizes review of “all constitutional errors” ignores the statutory language.) Appellant cites to no authority from this Court, or from any other source, that remotely suggests that the claim he has belatedly identified implicates the statutory standard. Merely labeling a waived claim as one implicating the standard, as appellant does, does not make it so. Nothing in the statute, this Court’s practices, or this Court’s precedent suggests that our statutory review of death sentences for passion, prejudice or arbitrariness operates as an obligation to discover and raise any and all possible new defense claims and constitutional theories, such that a claim of <em>sub silentio </em>appellate court decision and “error” becomes available on reargument.</p>

The state supreme court did not address any federal constitutional issue that Bronshtein did not raise; nor did the state supreme court address the question whether Bronshtein’s state-law arguments would have merit if recast in federal constitutional terms. It seems fanciful to suggest that, in every capital appeal, the state supreme court actually considers and rejects a host of federal constitutional claims without receiving briefing or argument on those claims from counsel and without even mentioning in the opinion of the court that the claims were entertained.</blockquote>

Under the PCRA, a petitioner may not obtain relief on a claim that was “previously litigated,” 42 Pa. Cons.Stat.

Cons.Stat. Ann. § 9544. Thus, if a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision affirming a capital conviction and sentence on direct review is deemed to signify that the Court considered and rejected every possible federal constitutional argument that could be made based on the record, it would follow that no such claims could ever be asserted under the PCRA. <em>See Holland v.

The exhaustion requirement is rendered meaningless since all possible claims are deemed to be exhausted on direct review.
