In <em>Neivport Township, </em>a first class township provided its employees post-retirement health insurance, and then sought to revoke that benefit. The Commonwealth Court held that an employee who has complied with all conditions necessary to receive a retirement allowance cannot be adversely affected by subsequent legislation that changes the terms of the retirement contract. <em><a href="/pa-commw/110/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="532 A.2d 1263" data-case-ids="1364523" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/110/0611-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/110/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="532 A.2d 1263" data-case-ids="1364523" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/110/0611-01">at 1265</a>.

Although this language is facially applicable only to supervisors, and despite the fact that the Township had not actually raised the argument that the board of supervisors lacked the authority to provide post-retirement medical insurance benefits to employees generally, the Commonwealth Court broadly found that according to Section 606(c), the board of supervisors could not provide medical insurance to retired employees generally. <em><a href="/a2d/874/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="874 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="8960989" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/1258-01">Id.</a> </em>(“the plain language of Section 606(c) provides that medical benefits are only available for current employees”).

Appellants assert that this language demonstrates that the legislature recognized that health insurance plans generally are a form of compensation requiring auditor approval in accord with Section 606(a), except where the insurance applies to supervisors “while in office or while in the employ of the township,” which, in accord with Section 606(c), does not require auditor approval. By enacting Section 606(c) and thereby removing group insurance benefits for supervisors while in office or in the employ of the Township from the general requirement of auditor approval for compensation contained in Section 606(a), Appellants assert that the legislature did not preclude a finding that post-retirement medical insurance benefits are compensation subject to auditor approval within Section 606(a).</p>

Finally, near the end of Section 606(a), the legislature refers to changes in salary, compensation, or emoluments. The legislature, therefore, referred to salaries and compensation available to supervisors, compensation available to supervisor-employees, and salary, compensation and emoluments.

The text of the former 53 P.S. § 65515 became Section 606(a), which continued to provide that the compensation of supervisor-employees must be fixed by the board of auditors. Subsection (b) identified pensions as a form of auditor-approved compensation for which supervisor-employees were eligible, subject to specific conditions.

Accordingly, participation in insurance plans by supervisors while in office or employed by the township does not require auditor approval pursuant to Section 606(c).

In particular, when the Ordinance was passed on December 18, 1997, Mr. Napp was a thirty-year employee of the Township who would retire twelve days later; Mr. Caris was a thirty-one year employee who would retire two years later; and Mr. Hartranft was an employee two weeks short of his twenty-year anniversary date (and thus full “vesting” of his new-found post-retirement medical benefit right) who would retire six months later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Leaving aside the fact that he retired a full decade after the resolution <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>was passed, the employee in <em>Newport Township </em>was not also a supervisor (and thus did not help pass the resolution); therefore, that case has no bearing on the self-interest issue before this Court today.</p>

The provision of post-retirement medical benefits was simply not a term that the supervisors bargained for when they agreed to serve or that “attracted]” them to work for the Township. Thus, by passing the Ordinance on their way out of the door, the supervisors essentially were helping themselves to more than just the fruit of their own labors. In light of the foregoing, even if, after strictly construing the Second Class Township Act, I agreed with the Majority that the Act provides supervisors the power to grant themselves post-retirement medical benefits, I would not find that the supervisors <em>sub judice </em>strictly complied with such power.

The timing of the supervisors' decisions to grant themselves post-retirement medical benefits — and, in relatively quick succession, to begin earning them — is telling in another respect. Although the parties overlook the fact, by completing their service as supervisors two weeks after passing the Ordinance in December 1997, Messrs. Napp and Caris avoided the prospect of answering to their employers — the Township's voters — in the next municipal election, and, although Mr. Hartranft remained in office for eighteen months after voting for the Ordinance, it appears that the same can be said for him. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 567-68, 985 A.2d at 748 (noting that Mr. Hartranft was first elected in 1977 and served continuously thereafter); 53 P.S. § 65403(a) (providing for six-year terms for supervisors of second-class townships). Therefore, by waiting until 1997 to vote themselves post-reliremeni medical benefits, the three supervisors were able to benefit from the controversial decision without running the risk of being unseated.</p>
