Thus, we must determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the Commonwealth disproved Appellant’s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden in this regard, and reject the remaining claims raised by Appellant. Accordingly, we affirm Appellant’s judgment of sentence.</p>

At approximately 2:00 a.m., the officers observed a large crowd in the parking lot of a Getty Mart, located at Eighth and Walnut Streets in the City of Reading. Moments later, a radio broadcast from dispatch informed the officers of a fight at that location, and advised that one individual threatened to shoot another. N.T. 8/4/2008 at 119. Having failed to observe any actual fighting, the officers pulled over their unmarked vehicle so that they could continue to view the crowd.</p>

As they did not want to approach the group of individuals in plainclothes, and Officer Wertz was wearing shorts, they remained in their vehicle and waited for uniformed officers to arrive. <em>Id. </em>at 125. Officer Eddinger then heard three or four gunshots, which he believed were fired from a large caliber gun in the parking lot. <em>Id. </em>Officer Wertz thereafter stated, “The guy in the blue <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>shirt.” <em>Id. </em>at 127. At that moment, Officer Eddinger observed a man wearing a blue polo shirt, who was later identified as Appellant, walk out of the parking lot and place an object into his waistband. <em>Id. </em>at 127-28.</p>

Unbeknownst to Appellant, Officer Wertz ran up behind Appellant and stopped within a foot of him. <em>Id. </em>at 130. Appellant then turned around and stood face-to-face with Officer Wertz for a few seconds before Appellant ran south on Eighth Street. While Officer Eddinger did not see their lips moving during the brief face-to-face encounter, it looked as though Appellant and Officer Wertz had spoken by the way they were standing. <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>

At no time during the chase did Officer Eddinger hear Officer Wertz identify himself as a police officer or direct Appellant to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 173. As the pursuit continued, Officer Eddinger saw Appellant turn and look over his left shoulder. <em>Id. </em>at 136. He then heard two gunshots, saw two muzzle flashes, and saw both Officer Wertz and Appellant fall to the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 137. Officer Eddinger immediately ran over to Appellant, grabbed him by the collar, and put his knee on Appellant’s back to apprehend him. <em>Id. </em>at 139.

Moments after the incident, several officers noted that Officer Wertz’s gun was strapped inside its holster, which was attached to Officer Wertz’s belt. N.T. 8/5/2008 at 218; 234; 299; 558. Further, an asp baton, which is a law enforcement instrument used for self-protection, was recovered on the <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>street in close proximity to where Officer Wertz’s body lay.

According to forensic expert, Kurt Tempinski, chemical testing demonstrated that the shot which struck Officer Wertz in the chest had been fired from a distance of four feet. <em>Id. </em>at 509. The bullet which struck Officer Wertz in the perineum had been fired when the muzzle of the weapon was either touching or was within three inches of the fabric of the officer’s shorts. <em>Id. </em>at 511. This evidence led Dr. Hoffman to conclude that Appellant first shot Officer Wertz in the chest, causing him to fall forward, bringing him in close contact with Appellant, who then fired a second time. <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>

N.T. 8/5/2008 at 292-93. When she learned that Officer Wertz had been shot, she described looking for witnesses as the large crowd was dispersing. <em>Id. </em>at 295. Detective Wise stated that she realized that no witnesses would be willing to give statements to the police when someone in the crowd shouted, “F_ _ _ the cops, f_ _ _ you all.” <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of a jailhouse informant, Jason Ott, who stated that while in his jail cell, Appellant confessed that he shot an officer and would get away with it because there were fifty or sixty people at the scene.

N.T. 8/7/08 at 612-13; 641. Fearing that the man was going to harm his friends, Appellant stated that he fired his own weapon into the air four or five times to “break everything up.” <em>Id. </em>at 613.

It further held that the court’s denial of Appellant’s post-sentence motion was “not manifestly unreasonable, was not the result of misapplication of law, and was not the result of partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will.” <em>Id.</em>

It reasoned that the <em>crimen falsi </em>adjudications “reflected substantially upon [Appellant’s] veracity and do not suggest a propensity to commit the serious offense with which [Appellant] was charged in this case, namely murder.” Trial Court Opinion at 9. The court emphasized that credibility was critical as Appellant contended he acted in self-defense, and it was the Commonwealth’s burden to prove that his acts were not justifiable. Considering that Officer Eddinger was the only eyewitness, and could not have testified as to whether Appellant believed he was in danger of death or serious bodily injury, the court concluded that the probative value of the <em>crimen falsi </em>evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>

Nevertheless, the court further held that the claim failed on the merits because the statement was unlikely to inflame the jury as it was not attributable to Appellant, but rather to “associates of [Appellant] and other people that were there.” N.T. 8/13/2008 at 126. The court <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>further emphasized that the comment “was a fair assessment of the evidence presented at trial.” Trial Court Opinion at 11.</p>

The court held that it did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the Commonwealth’s objections because such questions were, <em>inter alia, </em>irrelevant to the case.

Moreover, Appellant submits that the evidence demonstrated that an asp baton was found in the area where Officer Wertz had been shot, which no other officer claimed.

The Commonwealth points out that after being properly instructed on both the affirmative defense of self-defense and the elements of unreasonable belief voluntary manslaughter, the jury understandably chose to disbelieve Appellant’s testimony, which was rife with inconsistencies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> According to the Commonwealth, the jury simply <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>exercised its prerogative to accept all, part, or none of the evidence, resolved conflicts in the testimony in favor of the Commonwealth, and ultimately concluded that Appellant possessed the specific intent to kill Officer Wertz.

Contrary to the trial court’s ruling, Appellant submits that the prejudicial effect clearly outweighed any probative value because most of the adjudications occurred when he was thirteen or fourteen years’ old, and he was twenty-six years’-old at the <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>time of trial. Further, Appellant contends that the number of adjudications “besmirched” his character and suggested to the jury that Appellant had a propensity to commit the crime for which he was charged. Finally, and, most significantly, he maintains that evidence of his previous juvenile adjudications severely prejudiced him because credibility was critical to the jury’s determination of whether to believe Appellant’s claim that he was justified in using deadly force. Appellant asserts that Officer Eddinger was the primary Commonwealth witness who observed the events leading to the shooting, and could not have testified as to Appellant’s state of mind when he fired the fatal shots.

Regardless of whether the adjudications fall within the requisite time period of Rule 609, however, the Commonwealth maintains that the trial court properly held that the probative value of the <em>crimen falsi </em>adjudications outweighed any prejudicial effect because they “reflect substantially upon [Appellant’s] veracity and do not suggest a propensity to commit the serious offense with which [Appellant] was charged in this case, namely murder.” Trial Court Opinion at 9.

Upon further prompting by defense counsel, Appellant claimed that the object looked like "a gun.” <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth asserts that Appellant’s testimony relating to his motivation for the shooting was similarly contradictory as Appellant gave the following reasons why he shot Officer Wertz: (1) "I thought I was going to be shot;” <em>id. </em>at 622; 665; (2) I wanted "to get him to stop chasing me;” <em>id. </em>at 623; (3) “I wasn’t thinking when I pulled the trigger. I just pointed it back and fired.... It was an accident.” <em>id. </em>at <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>634; and (4) because Appellant intended "to cause serious bodily injury or death to the person that was chasing him." <em>Id. </em>at 636-37.</p>

Appellant, himself, introduced evidence of his prior juvenile adjudications due to the trial court's denial of his motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude them. Thus, we note that the issue before us is not the propriety of the trial court’s admission of the evidence, but rather the propriety of the trial court’s ruling on Appellant’s motion <em>in limine.</em>

The trial court specifically held that “in all of the cases more than ten years had passed since the date of the adjudication of delinquency or the last day of confinement.” Trial Court Opinion at 9. While the Commonwealth summarily challenges this finding, and asserts that the adjudications should be <em>per se </em>admissible as falling under the ten-year provision in Rule 609, the record is unclear as to precisely when Appellant served his "last day of confinement” on the adjudications.</p>
