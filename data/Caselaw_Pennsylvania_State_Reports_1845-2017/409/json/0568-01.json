        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Cohen,\nAppellant, Joseph A. Rohay, brought an action in trespass against appellee, William Breyak, for personal injuries suffered by appellant when the car driven by appellee, in which appellant was a passenger, crashed into a telephone pole.\nAt about 9:00 p.m. on December 28, 1956, appellant was a passenger in an automobile operated by appellee which was traveling in a northerly direction along Route 28, about one-half mile south of New Kensington. The road was partially wet and there was slush and mud on the shoulder of the road. Prior to the accident appellee was traveling about 45 miles an hour. As he proceeded north, appellee saw a southbound tractor-trailer being operated in the opposite direction. Suddenly another automobile, traveling in excess of 60 miles an hour, pulled out from behind the tractor-trailer and crossed into the appellee\u2019s lane of travel when the two cars were about 50 yards apart. When the two vehicles were about 30 feet from each other, appellee swerved off the road to his right and went onto the shoulder in order to avoid a head-on collision. After traveling approximately 50 feet on the shoulder, appellee tried to return to the highway but the rear wheels of his car began to slide causing the rear of his automobile to crash into a telephone pole. The jury returned a verdict for the appellee and appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. An appeal to this Court followed.\nThe sole question before us is whether there was evidence to support appellant\u2019s request for a charge \u201cthat even though there was a sudden emergency, if the jury found that this sudden emergency had ceased and then the defendant was thereafter negligent in trying to re-enter the highway that they could find a verdict in favor of plaintiff.\u201d The trial court correctly denied this request for want of sufficient evidence.\nThe lower court properly charged the jury on the issue of whether a sudden emergency justified appellant\u2019s actions: \u201cDetermine if this is what we call sudden emergency, or one is placed in sudden peril, driving out on the highway and a truck comes directly over your path, this means imminent danger or death, you turn and do the craziest thing, 'whether you turn to the right or left or go somewhere to escape that accident. This is what we call sudden peril.\u201d\nIt was not necessary to charge the jury on the possibility of the sudden emergency terminating once the automobile was on the shoulder. If we assume as we must \u2014 since the appellee is the verdict winner \u2014 that the jury found a sudden emergency initially arose to excuse the appellee from driving off the road, then the physical facts indicate that the emergency must have continued up until the point of impact. Appellee veered onto the shoulder at a speed of 45 miles an hour in order to avoid a head-on collision with an automobile Avhich Avas coming directly at him at a speed of over 60 miles an hour. The distance traversed between the time he veered off the highway until he hit the pole was only 50 feet. If the jury found a sudden emergency initially existed, so as to force appellant to make a momentary decision based upon impulse and instinct, then it is unreasonable to conclude that appellee was able to weigh alternative courses of action in the flashing instant that he was on the fifty-foot shoulder of the road. In the face of these strong physical facts, the vague statement of appellant \u2014 an obviously interested witness \u2014 that appellee had the car \u201cpretty much under control\u201d was correctly found by the court below to be insufficient to justify the requested charge.\nIn support of his position appellant relies heavily upon Randolph v. Campbell, 360 Pa. 453, 62 A. 2d 60 (1948). That case differs significantly from the instant case in several respects. First, the automobile in Randolph traveled three times further (150 feet to 50 feet) along the shoulder before the collision and therefore a jury could find the driver in that case had considerably more time to gain control over himself and his car. Secondly, the shoulder in the instant case was muddy and slushy, a fact which further contributed to the existence of an emergency situation.\nJudgment affirmed.\nNormally the question o\u00ed sudden emergency is for the jury but where, as in this case, tlio physical facts giving rise to the inception or termination of the emergency leave no room for doubt, the issue becomes a matter of law for the judge.
