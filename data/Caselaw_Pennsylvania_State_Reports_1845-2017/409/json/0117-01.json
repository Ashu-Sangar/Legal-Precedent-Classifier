        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from the affirmance by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County of an order of the Bureau of Employment Security denying appellant\u2019s petition for reassessment of its unemployment compensation contributions. Appellant is a partnership which is registered and licensed to engage in business as a broker and dealer in securities. The individuals in question are \u201cregistered representatives\u201d who are licensed to sell securities on appellant\u2019s behalf.\nThe issue before us is whether these registered representatives are included within the scope of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law so that appellant is required to make contributions on their behalf. The following facts are pertinent to this inquiry.\nThe Pennsylvania Securities Act provides that a registered dealer must file an application on behalf of an individual who wishes to sell securities. If the application is satisfactory, the individual is given a commission to sell securities on behalf of that dealer. This commission, which must be renewed annually, is revocable at the will of either the dealer or the individual.\nThe stipulated facts before us reveal that appellant provides the registered representatives with a desk in its office, clerical and secretarial services, statistical and market analysis reports, use of a telephone and general office supplies. The registered representatives are paid strictly on a commission basis but are allowed to draw against future commissions to pay any other expenses which may arise. They have no set working hours, are not required to attend sales meetings, and need not meet any particular quotas. Appellant supplies the registered representatives with its business cards, advertisement is done in appellant\u2019s name and all orders must be approved by appellant. If appellant refuses to accept an order, the registered representative may then deal with another broker.\nThe two aspects of this relationship stressed by appellant are (1) that the registered representatives are free from control with regard to the performance of their employment, and (2) that the registered representatives develop a following among some of their customers which they can transfer to another brokerage firm in the event of the cessation of their employment with appellant. Appellant had formerly made unemployment returns on behalf of the registered representatives but stopped the practice in reliance on a federal referee\u2019s decision that registered representatives were not subject to withholding from wages for purposes of the Social Security Act.\nWith these facts in mind, two provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law must be examined. Section 4(1) (2) (B) provides: \u201cServices performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that \u2014 (a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under his contract of service and in fact; and (b) as to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d Section (1) (4) (17) states that, even though otherwise included, the word \u201cemployment\u201d shall not include \u201cServices performed by an individual for an employer ... as a solicitor of applications for, or salesman of, shares of or certificates issued by an investment company.\u201d\nBefore examining more closely the words of the statute, three preliminary observations as to the structure of the act must be noted. In the first place, it is clear that the act\u2019s definition of \u201cemployment\u201d extends beyond those considered \u201cservants\u201d or \u201cemployes\u201d under common-law concepts. As Justice (later Chief Justice ) Stern said in Department of Labor and Industry v. Aluminum Cooking Utensil Company, 368 Pa. 276, 280, 82 A. 2d 897, 898-9 (1951), \u201cHaving in mind the broad purposes of this unemployment compensation legislation as expressed in the preamble to the act, it is our opinion that it was the intention of the legislature to provide for a larger coverage of employes entitled to unemployment compensation than merely those who would be considered employes under the common law. . . .\u201d See Note, 36 Ill. L. Rev. of Northwestern 873 (1942). Thus the alleged lack of control by appellant over the performance of the service is not determinative of the issue before us as it might have been if we were confronted with the question of the vicarious liability of appellant for a tort committed by a registered representative.\nSecondly, once it is shown by the department that an individual is performing services for wages, as that term is defined under the act, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to bring itself within either the general exception set forth in section 4(1) (2) (a) and (b) or one of the special exclusions such as section 4(1) (4) (17). Aluminum Cooking Utensil, supra; Bureau of Employment Security v. A.A.A. Moving and Storage Co., 76 Dauph. 335 (1961). Finally, the requirements of the exception in section (1) (2) being in the conjunetive, the taxpayer must satisfy both subsections (a) and (b) to exclude itself from coverage under the general exception.\nThe first question before us, therefore, is whether the registered representatives are performing services for \u201cwages.\u201d The latter term is defined by the act as \u201call remuneration paid by an employer to an individual with respect to his employment.\u201d Appellant argues that the registered representatives receive their earnings from the customer in return for services performed by them for the customer and that they are, in effect, engaged with appellant in a joint venture and, therefore, neither \u201cworks for the other.\u201d However, the facts reveal that the registered representatives receive their pay monthly from appellant \u2014 and not directly from the customer \u2014 based on a percentage of commissions received by appellant from the customers. Furthermore, the Securities Act limits the registered representatives to selling on behalf of a registered dealer and consequently they cannot be considered as partners with appellant in the business of selling securities. Hence, the department has brought this relationship within the general coverage of the act and the burden is upon appellant either to bring itself within section 4(1) (2) (a) and (b) or within the special exclusion in section 4(1) (4) (17). We agree with the court below that appellant has failed to sustain this burden.\nWith regard to section 4(1) (2), since we find that appellant has failed to satisfy subsection (b), we need not discuss in this case subsection (a). Subsection (b) requires that the individual in question be \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d One is not so engaged where he is dependent upon another for the continuance of his employment and thus becomes unemployed through no fault of his own. See Commonwealth v. Research, Inc., 9 Pa. D. & C. 2d 445 (1955) ; Murphy v. Daumit, 387 Ill. 406, 56 N. E. 2d 800 (1944) ; Wilcox, The Coverage of Unemployment Compensation Laws, 8 Vand. L. Rev. 245 (1955). As the court helow put it, one satisfies subsection (b) when he can be considered to be \u201cin business for himself.\u201d As we have pointed out above, the Pennsylvania Securities Act prohibits a registered representative from conducting his own business of selling securities. Indeed, his commission expressly limits him to selling securities on behalf of a registered dealer. In addition, the registered representative is dependent upon both the good will of appellant and its services \u2014 e.g., use of a telephone, statistical and market reports \u2014 to obtain customers. The Superior Court has held that traveling salesmen and insurance agents are not engaged in independently established trades so as to satisfy subsection (b) although they also often develop their own clientele. The position of the registered representative is quite different from that of the \u201cdistributors\u201d held to satisfy subsection (b) by this court in Aluminum Cooking Utensil, supra. We found there that the individuals in question could sell the products at any price they desired and that they were constantly selling the products of several competitors at the same time. Their continued employment was thus not dependent on the particular taxpayer involved in that case, as is true with the registered representatives and appellant.\nWe might add that the same result has been reached on this point in Vermont with identical statutory language, and in New York and Connecticut with seemingly less broad statutory language.\nAppellant also attempts to invoke the special exclusion in section 4(1) (4) (17) that the word \u201cemployment\u201d shall not include \u201cService performed by an individual for an employer as a . . . salesman of, shares . . . issued by an investment company.\u201d Appellant would have us define \u201cinvestment company\u201d as \u201cbusiness company\u201d and thus exempt earnings from the sales of securities generally. However, the term \u201cinvestment company\u201d is a word of art and refers to companies, such as mutual fund companies, whose business is to make a profit by investing in other companies. It is so defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, in the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, as well as in other Pennsylvania statutes. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the legislature intended to use the term in this accepted business sense. Appellant argues that it is illogical to exclude salesmen of securities issued by investment companies and not salesmen of securities issued by business corporations. We think that there are two answers to this assertion. First, matters of special exception from legislative coverage are exclusively within the cognizance of the legislature absent a showing of a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Secondly, other states have likewise made this limited exception to their unemployment compensation laws. Accordingly, the court below correctly ruled that appellant did not come within the exclusion in section 4(1) (4) (17).\nAppellant\u2019s reliance on the federal government\u2019s decision that registered representatives are not subject to the withholding provisions of the Social Security Act is ill-founded for two reasons. In the first place, the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under that act is based on master-servant concepts. Secondly, the referee\u2019s decision was based on the case of Dimmitt-Rickhoff-Bayer Real Estate Co. v. Finnegan, 179 F. 2d 882 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 340 U. S. 823 (1950), in which the eighth circuit held that a real estate salesman was not an employee within the Social Security Act\u2019s definition of that term. However, Judge Sanbokn, speaking for the court, stated that his result might well have been different if Congress had not repudiated the test of employment submitted by the Bureau of Internal Revenue that \u201can employee is an individual in a service relationship who is dependent, as a matter of economic reality, upon the business to which he renders service.\u201d As we have seen, this is one of the very tests adopted by our legislature. In fact, under an earlier and broader definition of \u201cemployee\u201d it was held that registered representatives were employees within the\nSocial Security Act. The federal government\u2019s practice under the Social Security Act is thus not relevant to our inquiry here.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAct of June 24, 1939, P. L. 748, \u00a78, as amended, July 10, 1941, P. L. 317, \u00a71, 70 P.S. \u00a738 (Supp. 1961).\nAct of June 24, 1939, P. L. 748, \u00a711, as amended, July 10, 1941, P.

This section also specifically excludes real estate salesmen and insurance agents.\nAct of December 5, 1936, P. L. (1937) 2897, \u00a74, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7753(x).\nLeinbach Company, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board, 146 Pa. Superior Ct. 237 (1941). The Leinbach case was followed in. Walters v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 56 Dauph. 245 (1945).\nSuperior Life, Health & Accident Insurance Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 307 (1942). Of course, section 4(1) (4) (17) now specifically excludes insurance agents.\nVermont Securities, Inc. v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 118 Vt. 196, 104 A. 2d 915 (1954).\nClaim of Dunne, 293 N. V. 780, 58 N.E. 2d 520 (1944).\nRobert C. Buell & Co. v. Danaher, 127 Conn. 606, 18 A. 2d 697 (1941).\nThe registered representatives do- sell securities issued by mutual fund companies. However, appellant\u2019s records do not distinguish with any degree of accuracy the amount of earnings from this source as opposed to the sale of other types of securities and hence appellant relies on a reading of \u00a74(1) (4) (17) which would exclude salesmen of all types of securities.\n15 U.S.C. \u00a780a-3 (1952).\nAct of November 10, 1959, P.
