A taxpayer who desires to challenge a deed transfer tax must either pay the tax and sue for refund \u2014 the payment of the tax permitting him to record his deed\u2014 or refuse to pay and await suit. He cannot, without putting the sum demanded in the public treasury, both gain the advantages of payment and also avoid the possibility of interest and penalty payments. I would, therefore, vacate the judgment entered by the court below.",
