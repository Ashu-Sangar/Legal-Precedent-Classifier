See Cadwallader v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., 396 Pa. 582, 152 A. 2d 484 (1959). The measure of recovery for breach of this obligation is the cost of hiring substitute counsel and other costs of the defense. The parties have stipulated that appellee is liable for $2,316.25, the amount expended by appellant in hiring substitute counsel and otherwise defending the suit brought against him by the injured party. Hence, appellee has compensated appellant for breach of its duty to defend.\nAs for the alleged willful refusal to settle, the court below resolving conflicting testimony specifically found that there was no opportunity and therefore no refusal to settle by appellee. Since this finding is amply supported by the record, we are not called upon in this case to re-examine the nature of the insurer\u2019s obligation in this regard.\nJudgment affirmed.",

In the instant action the insured was reimbursed for all sums expended in the defense of the related action. Further, the court below correctly concluded that under the established facts no bad faith or wilful breach of its obligation existed on the part of the insurer when it failed to defend. Since an alleged exercise of bad faith was the sole basis of the cause of action, the judgment must be affirmed.",
