It represents a merger of three banks which closed during the depression but were reopened thereafter as the Blairsville National Bank. Appellant contends (1) that the evidence was inadequate to support the finding and decision of the Department of Banking approving Conemaugh’s application, and (2) that the Department clearly abused its discretion in approving the charter (Articles). In support of its position appellant contends (a) that the past history of the banking business in Blairsville demonstrates that it has become a “one bank” town; (b) that the present banking facilities in Blairsville are adequate to meet the banking needs of the neighborhood and the surrounding country and the existence of two banks therein will lead only to an “overbanked” community which will be detrimental to “depositors, creditors, stockholders and the public alike”; (c) that a population of 9,091 is a pitifully small population figure to support more than one bank; (d) that the population of the “trade area” <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>lias been decreasing; (e) that Indiana County is recognized Federally as a “distressed area”; (f) that the density of the population of the community or “trade area” to be served by Conemaugh has been declining; (g) that economic conditions in that area have been deteriorating; (h) that “the density of the population in the neighborhood designated for the place of business of Conemaugh and in the surrounding country” does not afford reasonable promise of adequate support for the new bank; and (j) that its incorporation will not enhance the advantage of the public.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[167,964,1150,468]]]'>Appellant also points out (a) that the Comptroller of the Currency disapproved a branch bank application for Blairsville by the First National Bank of Indiana in 1955 and in 1958, and (b) that the present Secretary of Banking disapproved in 1958 the application of the Homer City State Bank for a branch bank in Blairsville and (c) that since that time economic conditions in Blairsville have become worse instead of better.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[164,1453,1151,957]]]'>Appellant further points out that the Department’s Chief Examiner, Mr. L. W. Piedi, recommended that the present application of Conemaugh be disapproved. Of course, Piedi’s findings and recommendations are only advisory, and the decision of the Secretary of Banking is the decision of the Department of Banking. Appellant further contends (a) that none of the incorporators or proposed directors of Conemaugh have had any experience in the business of banking and (b) while they have a fine reputation, their experience and general fitness for the business of banking are not such as to command the confidence of the community and warrant the belief that the business of the proposed institution will be efficiently conducted. Moreover, while the Treasurer of the proposed bank has had considerable experience in banking, such experience has been very limited, insofar as operating a bank is concerned.</p>

Applicant also presented evidence from business men in this wider area who testified that their businesses had increased substantially during the last ten years. Furthermore, the median income for Blairsville has risen from $2,484 in 1950 to $5,599 in 1960; and the total income for Blairsville has increased from $4,048,000 to $7,508,000. Home ownership has increased 10 percent, and the deposits of the appellant Blairsville National Bank have risen from $5,875,000 in 1950 to $9,668,196 as of December 31, 1961.</p>
