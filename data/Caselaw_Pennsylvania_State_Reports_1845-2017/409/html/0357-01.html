A release of all claims for damages for personal injury given to a person who is <em>not legally liable </em>for the injury does not bar an action against the tortfeasor who is liable: <em>Wilbert v.

It has long been the law that for the same injury, an injured party may <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>have but one satisfaction, and the receipt of such satisfaction, either as payment of a judgment recovered or consideration for a release executed by him, from a person liable for such injury necessarily works a release of all others liable for the same injury: <em>Thompson v. Fox, </em>supra, and <em>Hilbert v. Roth, </em>supra. The rationale for this rule is set forth in <em>Thompson v. Fox, </em>at page 213, as follows: “. . . the principle which underlies the rule is that the injured person is given a legal remedy only to obtain compensation for the damage done to him, and when that compensation has been received from any of the wrongdoers, his right to further remedy is at an end.” Although the Church is not legally liable and, therefore, the foregoing rule would not be applicable thereto in the strict sense, the liability of the City is predicated upon, and must be preceded by, the negligent maintenance of the sidewalk by the Church: <em>Wright v. Scranton, </em>supra. If the Church is not a wrongdoer, the City will not be liable in this case. The plaintiffs have already received at least a partial satisfaction from one who must be a wrongdoer in order for plaintiff to recover from the City. Moreover, the City’s right of indemnity in the ordinary case is pursued to recover money paid by the City which should have been paid by the abutting property owner: <em>Philadelphia v. Reading Co., </em><a href="/pa/295/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="295 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1115205" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0183-01">295 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%2065" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="145 A. 65">145 A. 65</a> (1929). Where the right of indemnity is barred by the defense of charitable immunity, and the charity has nevertheless made a payment to the injured party, justice demands that such a payment be looked upon as a partial satisfaction of the plaintiff’s claim, because the primary obligation is that of the charity. The sum received may not be recovered again. Therefore, if any judgment is recovered against the City, which will establish the fact that the Church was negligent and a wrongdoer, albeit one protected by an immunity from liability for its negligence, credit must be <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>given for the sum already paid. The City’s liability, if any, must be limited to tbe amount of tbe judgment that is in excess of tbe sum that has already been paid. Order and judgment affirmed.</p>

While implied waiver is in the nature of an estoppel and sustained on similar principles, waiver and estoppel are net convertible terms. For instance, in estoppel, the intention to relinquish a right need not be present, whereas in waiver the choice between relinquishment and enforcement of a right is vital. Further, in waiver the intention of the party is controlling regardless of the attitude of the other party. Waiver basically involves the conduct of only one of the parties. Estoppel involves the acts of both. See, 56 Am. Jur., Waiver, §3 at 103, 105.</p>
