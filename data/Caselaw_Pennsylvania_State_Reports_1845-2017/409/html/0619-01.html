The complaint stated: “Marie Coleman was hit over the head with a phone and her husband detained.” There was no indication what the termination of this incident was. The defendant submitted the following point for charge, “Evidence tending to show that the defendant committed an assault on Marie Coleman a number of years prior to the present charge does not apply the basis for an inference of malice on the part of the defendant, or that defendant murdered Marie Coleman.” The court properly refused this point as stated. The reference to an assault committed “a number of years prior to the present charge” was clearly misleading and the trial court was correct in refusing to charge in a manner which improperly stated the facts. We believe that the evidence on this point was, at best, of doubtful probative value, but its introduction was not such fundamental error as to require a new trial.
