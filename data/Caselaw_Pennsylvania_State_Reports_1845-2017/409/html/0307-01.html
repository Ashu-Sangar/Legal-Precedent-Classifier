Foote, the plaintiff in the lower court, was the owner of a four level split level home of brick veneer construction, which was built for her by her husband, James W. Foote, a contractor, and they occupied the dwelling from March 26, 1956 until a fire on January 1, 1957 did considerable damage to the premises. The home was intended as a model home and was advertised for sale some months after completion. The defendant’s policy was issued to plaintiff on November 5, 1956. The plaintiff was insured by the defendant company, which provided coverage against fire loss as follows: “Dwelling house, $45,000.00; Contents, $18,-000.00; and, additional living expenses, $9,000.00.” The plaintiff filed proof of loss forms wherein she demanded the full amount of each type coverage provided under such policy.</p>

The trial judge charged in part “. . . There is no doubt about it, your verdict will be for the plaintiff in this case because the insurance company has admitted that there was a loss here and they are liable for the loss.
