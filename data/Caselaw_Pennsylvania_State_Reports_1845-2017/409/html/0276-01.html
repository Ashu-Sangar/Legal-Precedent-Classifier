They observed a number of frogs in a puddle of water outside the double foundation walls. They then heard frog-like sounds coming from the ground inside the foundation walls. They went over to investigate. At this point on the foundation wall there were two sections which were about four feet apart. Nicholas stood on the top of the outside wall and looked down between the sections and <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>saw a frog in a pool of water about 18 feet below tbe outer and inner sections of tbe wall. Tbe boys were throwing stones at tbe frog. Tbe minor plaintiff bad picked up a stone and bad bis left foot on tbe outer wall and bis right foot on tbe ground. He was waiting for tbe frog to come to tbe surface of tbe water. At this moment be lost bis balance and fell approximately 18 feet between tbe two sections of tbe wall.</p>
