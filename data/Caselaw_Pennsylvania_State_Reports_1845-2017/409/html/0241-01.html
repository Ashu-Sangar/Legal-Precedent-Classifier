A study of the record in that case discloses that the issue of the incompatibility of the offices involved therein and the <em>court’s power to determine that question in the absence of pertinent legislative expression </em>was squarely raised and at issue in the proceedings both in the lower court and in this Court. On appeal, this Court adjudicated that issue even though it quashed the appeal on other grounds. It was plainly an intricate embodiment of the court’s determination. This is not “dicta”! Where a decision rests on two or more grounds equally valid, none may be relegated to the inferior status of obiter dictum: <em>Manley v.

Public policy demands that an office holder discharge his duties with undivided loyalty. The doctrine of incompatibility is intended to assure performance of that quality. Its applicability does not turn upon the integrity of the person concerned or his individual capacity to achieve impartiality, for inquiries of that kind would be too subtle to be rewarding. The doctrine applies inexorably if the offices come within it, no matter how worthy the officer’s purpose or extraordinary his talent.”</p>

Article XII, section 2 of the Constitution provides that the General Assembly may by law declare what offices are incompatible. We have been pointed to no statute which declares the office of Justice of the Peace and Mayor incompatible. Inasmuch as the Constitution has provided a method of declaring what offices are incompatible, thereby announcing the public policy of this State in regard thereto, the courts are not permitted to hold offices incompatible merely because the <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>Legislature has failed to act, even though other states may have held such offices incompatible where the duties of one conflict with those of the other.

The actual holding of the case was that a private citizen cannot invoke the issuance of a writ of quo warranto unless he has a special interest in the controversy greater than that of a mere member of the public. Since the relator did not have such an interest, the court quashed the appeal. The statement of Justice Kephart regarding the incompatibility of offices was not decisional and was merely an additional observation in the form of dicta. The problem of incompatibility was not analyzed in the opinion, nor did the court discuss the history or the policy considerations underlying the doctrine. It is indicative that this court has not cited the <em>Sehermer </em>decision in any subsequent case involving the question of incompatibility.</p>

If, however, as here, the incompatibility is not determined by a statute, <em>but arises solely by reason of the fact that the duties of the two offices are such that it would be against public policy to permit one person to hold both of them, </em>then the incumbent may elect which he will retain. . . .” The entire tenure of the opinion of the court makes it clear that a court <em>can </em>assume jurisdiction in an action of quo warranto where the alleged incompatibility of offices was based upon grounds of public policy rather than statutory declaration. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Adams v. Holleran, </em><a href="/pa/350/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="350 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="461141" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0461-01">350 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20612" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="39 A.2d 612">39 A. 2d 612</a> (1944), we determined the incompatibility of two offices notwithstanding the fact that the legislature did not act.
