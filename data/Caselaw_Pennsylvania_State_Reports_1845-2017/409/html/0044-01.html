Letters of administration in his estate — valued at approximately $16,000 — were granted by the Register of Wills of Butler County to Ruth Watt. At the instance of Veronica Watt, Ruth Watt was required to file a first and partial account to which Veronica Watt filed exceptions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Later Veronica Watt, claiming the surviving spouse’s allowance and one-half of decedent’s estate, petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Butler County setting forth that, as decedent’s surviving widow, she requested that certain realty be set aside as her allowance and asked the appointment of appraisers of such realty. Appraisers appointed by the court valued the realty at $7500 and their report was confirmed nisi by the court. To this order of confirmation Ruth Watt excepted, alleging that the appraisal was inadequate, that Veronica Watt was not decedent’s lawful widow and that, even if she were, she had forfeited her rights by a wilful and malicious desertion of decedent. The Orphans’ Court of Butler County referred all these matters to Dale Painter, Esq., as auditor and said auditor, after hearing, concluded that Ruth Watt was decedent’s lawful <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>widow, that Veronica Watt was not the lawful widow, dismissed Veronica Watt’s exceptions to the account and sustained Ruth Watt’s exceptions to the confirmation of the appraisers’ report. Exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the auditor were argued before Judge Frank Graff, specially presiding, and Judge Graff overruled these exceptions. From that order this appeal was taken. It is to be noted that Judge Graff, unlike the auditor, did not determine whether Veronica Watt was decedent’s lawful wife at the time of his death but considered such determination unnecessary for the reason that Veronica Watt had forfeited any rights she might have because she had maliciously and wilfully deserted the decedent in May, 1950 and her conduct established that she had participated in a fraud on Ruth Watt and she was, by such conduct, estopped from claiming any part of the estate.</p>

Therefore, as a result of decedent’s lawful marriage to Veronica Watt, decedent could not lawfully have married Ruth Watt unless and until he was lawfully divorced from Veronica Watt (she being alive at the time of the marriage to Ruth Watt) and the law presumes the continuance of that marriage. There can be no doubt that decedent, in entering upon his marriage with Ida Bowman and Ruth Watt, relied upon the decree of divorce, granted prior to both marriages, conferring upon him the capacity to remarry. Such reliance upon the divorce by decedent and Ida Bowman was without any justification because both were parties to the fraud which eventually vitiated this divorce. Assuming that Ruth Watt acted in the utmost of good faith and in reliance upon the decree of divorce, per se such good <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>faith and reliance on her part would not breathe vitality into her marriage to decedent unless, <em>in </em>fact, decedent had the legal capacity to enter into such a marriage. The auditor correctly concluded that the setting aside of the divorce decree in 1958 rendered null and void the divorce granted in 1945 and that the setting aside of such divorce decree was binding upon the parties, the auditor and the court in this proceeding. The effect of the opening of the divorce decree was that, absent evidence or proof of any <em>other </em>divorce between Veronica Watt and decedent, decedent lacked the legal capacity to enter into either the marriage with Ida Watt or with Ruth Watt.</p>

Without either of these appearing if one of the parties marries again, while another presumption arises that it is innocent, that <em>alone </em>is not sufficient to overcome the previously existing presumption of the continued validity of the first marriage. <em>The second presumption does not of itself destroy the first hut requires some proof of facts and circumstances to he given the effect of overcoming the first; </em>as for instance, the long lapse of time during which the other party may be presumed to have died, the question of legitimacy of a child of the second marriage, the fact that the other spouse had likewise remarried and proof that the decedent, whose heirs are attacking the second marriage, had himself recognized the validity of it.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> (Emphasis supplied) To hold that the presumption of innocence and the presumption of the validity of a second marriage per se overcome the presumption that a valid marriage once established continues until the contrary is proven would result in a situation where the presumption of innocence and presumption of the validity of the second marriage “could be applied with equal effect to validate every case of meretricious relations, of which scores or more have been rejected as invalid in the Supreme Court and this court”: <em>Sharpe v. Federal Cleaning Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/144/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="144 Pa. Super. 231" data-case-ids="1032754" data-case-paths="/pa-super/144/0231-01">144 Pa.

A man cannot at the same time legally have two wives; and one who has married once cannot lawfully marry again unless the first marriage has been dissolved by absolute divorce or by death. . . . The marriage of a man or woman, where one of them has by a prior marriage a husband or wife who is then living and undivorced, is not merely voidable, but void, whether it be meretricious or founded in mistake.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[226,976,1157,1451]]]'>The real thrust of the several presumptions is to place the burden of proving the invalidity of the second marriage upon the person who claims such invalidity and to require proof of <em>some nature </em>that the first marriage was not dissolved by death or divorce at the time of the second marriage. From the presumption in favor of the validity of the second marriage and the presumption of innocence upon the part of the parties to that marriage there follows, as a corollary, another presumption, i.e., that either death or divorce had terminated the prior marriage, and he who claims the invalidity of the second marriage must overcome that presumption by proof of <em>some </em>nature: <em>Wile’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/6/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="6 Pa.

The presumption that a first marriage has been terminated by death or divorce is neither absolute nor inflexible and each case must be resolved on the basis of its own facts and circumstances and such inferences as fairly arise and can be reasonably drawn from them. The presumption of the dissolution of a prior marriage, by death or divorce, should be indulged in only with the greatest of caution, otherwise the status of marriage may be seriously jeopardized. Where there is a conflict between the various presumptions, that presumption should yield which from the evidence and inferences therefrom render it the least probable to sustain.</p>

The ultimate presumption upon which the auditor reached his conclusion was that the marriage between decedent and Veronica Watt had been dissolved by divorce. The basis for the auditor’s conclusion was that, while the long lapse of time, the statements, declarations and actions of Veronica Watt, the innocence of Ruth Watt and “the other facts and circumstances here present” (which the auditor fails to specify) do not per se prove the dissolution by divorce of decedent’s marriage to Veronica Watt, they do show a <em>“probability” </em>of such dissolution, considering that decedent had lived in Allegheny and Butler Counties as well as South America, in all of which jurisdictions he <em>could have </em>secured a divorce. Therefore, concluded the auditor, these factors plus the presumption of innocence “neutralized” the presumption of the continuance of the decedent-Veronica Watt marriage and left unproven by Veronica Watt the fact that the marriage had <em>not </em>been dissolved by divorce.</p>

We must examine this record to ascertain whether there is any evidence or inferences therefrom proving the improbability that either party secured a valid divorce.</p>

The fact that decedent instituted this action renders clearly unlikely and highly improbable that up until that time he had secured a divorce; we cannot attribute to the decedent a vain and useless act. The manner in which that divorce was obtained is highly significant insofar as it throws light on whether up until that time a divorce had been obtained by Veronica Watt. Through the machinations of decedent, every effort was made to conceal from Veronica Watt any knowledge of the divorce proceedings, even to the extent of having Ida Watt masquerade as Veronica Watt, and such concealment clearly raises the inference that Veronica Watt would have opposed the divorce and, by the same token, the inference that she up until that time had not obtained a divorce. Furthermore, it was only <em>after, </em>and shortly thereafter, the grant of this divorce in Philadelphia that decedent married the woman with whom he had been living meretriciously for some time, a clear indication that decedent considered that the grant of this divorce removed the <em>only </em>impediment to a marriage with Ida Watt, negativing the existence of any other prior divorce. It was decedent’s reliance on this divorce decree which led to his marriage with Ida Watt and later with Euth Watt and it is clear that his reliance on the vitality of this divorce decree relieved him of any motivation thereafter to secure a divorce from Veronica Watt.</p>

Just as we extend to the parties to a second marriage the presumption of innocence, by the same token, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must extend to Veronica Watt the presumption that she believed that the conduct between the parties arose from the marital state rather than a meretricious relationship and from such conduct infer that, so far as Veronica Watt knew, the marriage between the parties had not been dissolved, certainly by any action on her part.

Attorney Criste, prior to April 23, 1957, had informed decedent of an action of divorce then contemplated by Veronica Watt and requested that decedent pay counsel fees and costs in connection with such action; (b) decedent then inquired upon what grounds Veronica Watt would seek a divorce; (c) decedent actually paid |375 toward counsel fees and costs; (d) Attorney Criste concluded that, since Veronica Watt’s residence was in Maryland, she could not institute a divorce action in Pennsylvania; (e) the money advanced by decedent was returned to him.

Here the <em>consensual separation </em>of 20 years was broken and ceased when the parties ... in July, 1949 agreed to resume the marital relationship and to live together in a marital domicile belonging to the husband at Wolf Creek.

The auditor found that, for almost twenty years during which the parties lived apart, such separation was consensual and the record fully supports such finding. The record reveals that during a considerable portion of that <em>time </em>— not <em>only from July 1949 </em>— the parties spent considerable time together, had sexual relations and stayed at various places in various localities and there can be no doubt that, while the parties did not live under the same roof, such separate living was consented to by the decedent.

Throughout this record there is evidence of references by decedent to some unspecified and strange troubles or difficulties which had to be straightened out by him before the parties could resume married life, the only specification of any such trouble taking place when decedent and Ida Watt were living together, either before or after their marriage, at which time decedent expressed a fear of “that woman”. It is significant of decedent’s state of mind that in February 1950, at a time when he was unemployed, he wrote to Veronica Watt: “I realize you would like to get to know for sure, what and where we go, from here. But so would I. And I will have to see where I am going from here on out. It would be nothing for me to be on the down and out side, but with you in that kind of a deal, no”. The last meeting between the parties took place in May, 1950 at the farm in Slippery Rock and at that time decedent was asked by Veronica Watt: “Do you want me to come down next weekend?” and decedent replied: “Why so soon?” In saying goodbye to Veronica Watt, decedent said: “You’ll get a letter on Wednesday” but no letter ever came. Veronica Watt testified that she had written to her husband, told him that until she knew definitely what his plans were, she could not resign her teaching job and notified him that she did not intend living with him as in the past, i.e., clandestinely. To this no satisfactory reply was ever received. Within two months of the last meeting between the parties, decedent married Ruth Watt and effectively precluded any resumption of married life with Veronica Watt. Under all these circumstances, particularly since decedent knew what Veronica did not know, i.e., that he had secured a divorce, it is crystal clear that decedent did not <em>in good faith </em>desire to effect a reconciliation and a resumption of mar<a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>ried life and that there was no rejection by Veronica Watt of an offer to resume married life.

In Richardson, supra, the facts were as follows: In 1849, Richardson married one Matilda Little and had two children by her; in 1857 the parties separated and Richardson, a Pennsylvania resident, instituted a divorce action in Pennsylvania which was refused in 1859; upon the same grounds Richardson, then residing in Indiana, obtained a divorce in that state; in 1861 Richardson married one Sarah Walter by whom he had three children before her death in 1880; in 1881 he married one Louisa S. with whom he lived until his death. In the meantime, Matilda Richardson had remarried and later separated. Upon Richardson’s death, Matilda Richardson made claim of his estate as his lawful wife. The court pointed out that after 1860, although in need, she never made any demand upon her husband for support and that with <em>full knowledge </em>she acquiesced in the marriage of Sarah Walter and raised no question of the invalidity of that marriage for the twenty years during which that marriage continued and that such facts gave rise to a strong presumption that her own marriage to Richardson had either been annulled or that it had been discovered never to have had a legal existence. Furthermore, Matilda Richardson acquiesced in the marriage of Richardson to Louisa, a .fact which adds strength to the presumption. The court then added: “If this were all, it would not be easy to. conceive of a case to which the doctrine of estoppel could be applied with greater justice; but there is much more” (p. 293). The court then pointed out <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>that Matilda had remarried and, that, in order to sustain her claim against the estate, she had to prove illegal her second marriage and show that she had committed bigamy. Under such circumstances the court properly held that Matilda was “estopped from alleging the continuance of the former coverture, where the effect is to invalidate the later one” (p. 294). <em>Richardson </em>does not control the instant situation for the facts <em>are </em>vastly different; in <em>Richardson </em>there was actual knowledge of both later marriages by the claimant as well as a remarriage by the claimant herself neither of which are present in the factual situation in the case at bar. The decisional point of <em>Richardson </em>is that, under the evidence, a strong presumption arose that Matilda Richardson’s marriage to Richardson had either been dissolved or never had a legal existence and that Matilda Richardson was by her own conduct <em>in remarrying </em>estopped from raising the question. In <em>U. S. National Bank in Johnstown, </em>supra, the defendants having certified to a bank from which credit was obtained that certain work had been satisfactorily completed, were held estopped as against the bank to defend on the ground that the work was not satisfactorily completed.

Her place of employment was far removed from Slippery Rock Township where Ida Watt was living with decedent. Furthermore, there is no evidence at all that Ida Watt’s position <em>as decedent’s wife </em>was known to Veronica Watt or whether she did or did not make known to anyone that she, Veronica Watt, claimed to be the lawful wife. The record further shows that Ruth Watt did not know either decedent or Ida Watt prior to the latter’s death nor is there any basis, except pure speculation, for the statement that had Veronica Watt made known to people in Slippery Rock that she was the lawful wedded wife that such knowledge would have come to the attention of Ruth Watt prior to her marriage.</p>
