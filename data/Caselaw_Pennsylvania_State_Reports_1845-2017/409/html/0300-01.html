Plaintiffs allege that shortly after the tenants vacated the premises in accordance with the order of the Allegheny County Health Department children from the neighborhood came on the premises to play, broke windows, doors and did damage to the floors so as to make them unsafe, and in general created a nuisance which was dangerous and hazardous to children as well as to all people in the neighborhood.</p>

Failure to give warning to the minor plaintiff and such as him knowing that the failure to do so would endanger life and limb since there was existing an attractive nuisance. 3. Failure to take proper measures to prevent children and others from coming on the property when the defendants knew of the danger and were bound to anticipate that children would come on the premises. 4. Failure to take affirmative action against the owners to have them cor<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>rect the conditions. 5. ‘They failed to take active steps to abate the dangerous and hazardous nuisance.’ ”</p>

Prior to 1956 the City of Pittsburgh maintained its own department of health and exercised certain powers through that department for the protection of the public health in accordance with the various statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[242,1148,1157,958]]]'>The appellants argue that a municipality is liable in tort for permitting a nuisance to be maintained in its jurisdiction and under its direct control, and further contend that legal title is not necessary to hold a municipality liable for permitting the nuisance, merely the right to possession and direct control over the property. The appellants rely on <em>Cooper v.

In reviewing the <em>Reading </em>case we find an entirely unrelated situation because in that case the city, pursuant to an easement, discharged its storm drainage water into the bed of a former canal which formed a pool where two boys drowned. In this case the city had control of the land. In the <em>Pinteh </em>case the County of Allegheny bought the property involved with two other taxing bodies at a tax sale and rented the property out to tenants.</p>

    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[189,481,1153,1294]]]'>The appellant further argues that under the Local Health Act, supra, 16 P.S. §12012 (d), Allegheny County has an absolute and imperative duty to abate this type of nuisance and the breach of this duty renders it liable in tort. This section of the Act reads as follows: “(d) Whenever the health director finds a nuisance detrimental to the public health, he shall cause such nuisance to be abated. Except in an emergency, the health director shall give notice in writing to the owner or his agent, or to the occupier of the premises where the nuisance or cause of the nuisance is located, or to the person known or suspected to have caused the nuisance. The notice shall contain a statement of the conditions constituting the nuisance and an order to abate the nuisance within a specified time. The time specified shall be reasonable. In case the order of abatement is not obeyed, the health director shall abate the nuisance. The cost of abatement shall be recoverable from the owner of the premises where the nuisance or cause of nuisance was located, or from any other person who may have caused the nuisance, in the same manner as debts of like character are now collected by law, or in the manner provided by law for the collection of municipal claims.”</p>

    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[242,520,1154,478]]]'>The Allegheny County Department of Health was under no obligation to find that the structure constituted a public nuisance, especially when it is extremely doubtful if such a finding could have been justified. The only danger the house created was one to immediate trespassers and to no one off the premises. The county health department merely found that the health laws and regulations of the Commonwealth were not being complied with.</p>
