During the course of constructing a playground area as provided in the contract, appellant came upon some unforeseen rock formations the removal of which would have cost appellee an additional amount of money. The matter was discussed with the architect and with various members of the Authority and, although the exact arrangement is not clear, it was <em>orally </em>agreed that ap<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>pellant should do other excavation work instead of that called for in the contract and should build the playground in a different area of the school grounds. The substitute work was completed by appellant and payment made as provided for in the contract. In denying appellee’s claim, the arbitrators held that the contract permitted oral change orders. For the reasons discussed above, the court below properly ruled that this was an incorrect interpretation of the contract. Instead of resubmitting the claim to the arbitrators to ascertain what amount was due, however, the court below entered judgment on the claim in favor of appellee for $13,248, basing this figure on the testimony of appellee’s witnesses before the arbitrators that 27,600 cubic yards were not excavated under the original contract and that forty-eight cents per yard was a fair and reasonable price for this work.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[156,1289,1152,967]]]'>The entry of judgment on the claim by the court below was error for two reasons. In the first place, even assuming that appellant was liable for the difference between the amount of excavation required by the contract and the amount actually done, the arbitrators were not bound to accept the figures submitted by appellee’s witnesses, and it was error for the court below to do so. In calculating appellant’s claims for extra work, the arbitrators on several occasions arrived at different figures than those submitted by appellant’s uncontradicted witnesses. Questions such as the amount of work not done under a contract and the value of such work are not only particularly suitable for arbitrators who can bring their personal expertise to bear on such problems, but would seem to be questions of fact not reviewable by the courts under the Act of 1927. See <em>McDevitt v. McDevitt, </em><a href="/pa/365/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="365 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1225616" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0018-01">365 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.2d%20394" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="73 A.2d 394">73 A. 2d 394</a> (1950).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>The second error of the court below on this point was its implicit assumption that appellee could maintain this restitutionary action to recover for work not done under the original contract without giving appellant credit for the work done under the oral, unauthorized contract. In effect, appellee is trying to recover $13,248 — the alleged value of the work not performed — which it voluntarily paid to appellant with knowledge that the playground had been built in another section of the school grounds, while at the same time retaining without cost to it the playground and excavation work done under the oral contract. This it cannot do. Where a public body has accepted the benefits and voluntarily tendered the consideration on an unauthorized contract, it cannot maintain an action to recover the payments unless a denial of recovery will result in an unjust enrichment of the other party. <em>Bride v.
