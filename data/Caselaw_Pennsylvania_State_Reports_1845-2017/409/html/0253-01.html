Shapiro Company is a partnership engaged in the practice of public accounting, having its only office in the City of Philadelphia. Throughout the fiscal years ending March 31, 1955 to March 31, 1959, the years here in question, Shapiro derived gross receipts from accounting services performed for clients located <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>outside of Philadelphia, ranging from a low of $46,-214.95 in fiscal 1955 to a high of $67,081.50 in fiscal 1957. During each of the fiscal years involved, at least one of Shapiro’s partners was a nonresident of Philadelphia, and the aggregate profit participation of the nonresident partners was never less than 46 per cent; the highest proportion of nonresident partners was 4 out of 5 in fiscal 1958, representing an aggregate profit participation of 89 per cent. Approximately 78 percent of Shapiro’s receipts from out-of-city clients was attributable to services actually performed outside of the city at the places of business of various clients. The remaining 22 per cent is attributed to review, typing and proofreading of accounting statements in the office in Philadelphia and also to a ratable share of non-earning “office time”. “Office time” includes time spent on office administration, meetings, duplication of reports, reading of accounting and tax periodicals, etc., which Shapiro does not charge to specific clients.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[170,1382,1150,685]]]'>In filing net profits tax returns for the years in question, Shapiro excluded from its tax base the distributive shares of its nonresident partners attributable to services performed outside of Philadelphia. The Department of Collections of the City assessed additional taxes for the years in controversy, denying that Shapiro could allocate its net profits in the manner described. The Tax Review Board sustained the assessment, holding that Shapiro’s entire net profit was taxable. Shapiro’s appeal to the court below was sustained and the board reversed. The City, by stipulation, intervened and appeals the order of the court below to this Court.</p>

(d) On the net profits earned in <em>businesses, professions or other activities conducted in Philadelphia by nonresidents </em>after January 1, 1949 at the rate of 1%%, after January 1, 1956 at the rate of 1 %%, and after January 1, 1960 at the rate of 1%%.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

Shapiro argues that the partnership may not be considered as an entity having its “residence” in Philadelphia thereby making its net profits taxable in full under section 19-1502(c) of the Philadelphia Code. Appellee further contends that income derived by it from accounting services performed outside the city is not from “businesses, professions or other activities conducted in Philadelphia” merely because it has its office in the city and a minor portion of the overall services for its clients is performed at that office.</p>

Did the Sterling Act, which authorized Philadelphia to tax ‘persons . . . within the limits of such city . . contemplate and permit the taxation of a partnership whose persons or partners resided and conducted their business or transactions outside of Philadelphia? Perhaps it was with this question or doubt in mind that the City promulgated §220(b) of the Regulations: ‘If all partners are residents of Philadelphia, irrespective of where the activities of the partnership are conducted or if <em>all </em>the activities of the partnership are conducted in Philadelphia, irrespective of the residence of the partners, <em>all </em>of the net profits of the partnership shall be taxable on the partnership net profits tax return.’ This section of the Regulations also gives the following ‘example’ of a ‘Partnership located in Philadelphia’: ‘1 partner (a resident of Philadelphia) has a 10% interest, 2 partners (non-residents of Philadelphia) have remaining 90% interest; net profits <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>$100,000; 45% of business conducted in Philadelphia, 55% outside the City; $45,000 taxable to the partnership and $5,500 (10% of $100,000 less 10% of $45,000) taxable to the partner residing in Philadelphia’.</p>

It is rather a relation or status between two or more persons who unite their labor or property to carry on a business for profit. This is subject to an apparent exception, for while a partnership as such is not a person, it, as a matter of fact, is treated by a legal fiction as a quasi person or entity for such purposes as keeping of partnership accounts and marshaling assets . . . Until the promulgation of Pa. R. C. P. 2128, a partnership could not be sued in its firm name, and even yet, under Pa. R. C.

We could multiply authorities, but we must hold that the weight of authority in this Commonwealth is to the effect that a partnership is treated as an aggregate of individuals and not as a separate entity.
