This application was refused on the ground that the requested use was not a permitted use in a Residential “A” District. Thereupon MacLean appealed to the Board <em>requesting a variance. </em>On May 12, 1961 the Board rejected Mac-Lean’s appeal and, on appeal to the County Court, that court remanded the record to the Board for further hearing and findings of fact. The Board on February 21 and March 1, 1962 conducted further hearings, made findings of fact and conclusions of law and again refused a variance. An appeal was then taken to the County Court and that court, without hearing any additional testimony but after viewing the premises in person, reversed the Board and directed the grant of a variance. From that order the Borough has appealed.</p>

The record indicates beyond question that at each of the three hearings before the Board the Borough was a party, represented on record by counsel, that such counsel examined and cross-examined witnesses and that the Borough presented witnesses on its behalf. Upon MacLean’s appeal to the County Court no testimony was taken and there was no need nor necessity for the Borough’s counsel to appear at any hearing. Moreover, it is indicated that the court, prior to viewing the property, invited counsel, including the <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Borough counsel, to attend such view with the court, an indication that the court certainly considered the Borough a party to the litigation.</p>

Under the tax assessment act applicable in <em>Alloy, </em>supra, political subdivisions, including boroughs, were permitted to become parties to assessment proceedings before the board of assessment, the courts of common pleas and the Supreme or Superior Courts. Our Court construed that statute to require that a borough be a party in the common pleas court in order to appeal to the Supreme or Superior Courts and quashed the appeal of the borough from an order of a common pleas court which reduced the assessment on certain real estate. Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Kephart stated, inter alia (p. 432) : “There is but one way to be made ‘a party’ or litigant in a court, and that is to become one by appearing in the proceedings. Participation in some form in the court below is a requisite to appellant’s right to review.” In our view, the Borough in the case at bar actively participated in the proceedings before the Board and, in view of the fact that the court required no additional testimony but determined the matter on the testimony and record before the Board, further participation on the part of the Borough was unnecessary. On this record there exists a <em>requisite </em>participation by the Borough in the proceedings below so as to give the Borough a standing to take this appeal. <em>Alloy, </em>supra, does not control the instant situation. The motion to quash is refused.</p>

Nothing less than a showing of hardship, special and peculiar to the property involved, will empower the zoning board to permit a variance: Michener Appeal, <a href="/pa/382/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="382 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1259973" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0401-01">382 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="115 A.2d 367">115 A. 2d 367</a> <em>(1955); </em>Smolow v.

The authority of the board is not an arbitrary one and it may grant a variance only for reasons that are ‘ “substantial, serious, and compelling” ’: Ventresca v. Exley, <a href="/pa/358/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="358 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="8845076" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0098-01">358 Pa. 98</a>, 100, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20210" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="56 A.2d 210">56 A. 2d 210</a> (1948). The only evidence in support of the granting of the variance in this instance is that the appellant will suffer an economic hardship, if not permitted to pursue his plans. In his petition of appeal to the zoning board of adjustment, the reason stated in support of the application is that the present classification ‘causes appellant and petitioner to suffer a severe financial hardship’ .... His contention, pure and simple, is that the requested variance should be granted in order to enhance the value of his lot, ....

The ‘hardship’ which must be proven must be an ‘unnecessary’, not a ‘mere’ hardship, as well as ‘unique or peculiar to [the property involved] as distinguished from the impact of the zoning regulations on the entire district.’ The fact that an increase or decrease in value will result from the grant or refusal of a variance will not, standing alone, constitute a sufficient hardship.” Furthermore, the power to grant a variance must be exercised sparingly and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances: <em>Sgarlat v.

On the contrary, the Borough has shown that the grant of this variance will result in an increased <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>traffic hazard on the highways adjoining the property, that it is in the best interests of the municipality to maintain this and other contiguous properties in a residential district classification to act as a buffer against the encroachment of commercial establishments in nearby districts and that the enjoyment of the residential properties located immediately to the rear of and adjoining the subject property will be seriously affected by the erection and construction of a gasoline service station thereon. MacLean has simply failed to justify the grant of a variance in this instance.</p>

As Mr. Justice McBride, speaking for this Court in <em>Upper St. Clair Township Grange Zoning Case, </em>supra, stated (pp. 71, 72 ) : “Also, this hardship was created by the Grange itself. It is admitted by the Grange that they knew that the township had zoning regulations but did not make any investigation to determine whether the property could be used as they contemplated under the applicable zoning ordinance. Where the hardship, is . . ., self-inflicted, it is not the function of the court to grant redress in the form of a variance. The Grange cannot be heard to complain of the economic hardship involved as the same conditions were present <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>when they purchased, the property, [citing cases].” By the same token, the present owner of this property cannot now be heard to complain.</p>
