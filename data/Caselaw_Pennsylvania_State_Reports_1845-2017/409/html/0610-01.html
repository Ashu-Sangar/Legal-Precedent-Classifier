The soda water was previously bottled, sold and delivered by the defendant to plaintiff’s employer. The plaintiff sued the defendant bottler manufacturer in assumpsit, charging a breach of implied warranties, namely: (1) That the <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>soda water was of merchantable quality; (2) That it was fit and safe for the purposes for which it was sold.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court below sustained preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer.

Two interesting questions are posed by this appeal: (1) Did this implied warranty extend to the plaintiff, an employee of the purchaser? (2) Did the warranty cover the container as well as the contents of the bottle? Our answer to the first question is determinative of the case.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[223,1380,1160,689]]]'>Pennsylvania was the first state to adopt the Uniform Commercial Code (Code). See, Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, as amended, 12A P.S. §§1-101 et seq. dearly the Code gives no basis for the extension of the existing warranty to an <em>employee </em>of the purchaser. The pertinent provision, Section 2-318, is as follows: “A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.”</p>

It rests primarily upon the merchant-seller’s warranty under this Article that the goods sold are merchantable and fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used rather than the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Implicit in this section is that any beneficiary of a breach of warranty may bring a direct action for breach of warranty against the seller whose warranty extends to him.”</p>
    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[184,1132,1147,359]]]'>Comment 3 then states: “This section expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser.

    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[227,1067,1157,585]]]'>The general rule in the United States is that the mere resale of a warranted article does not give a sub-purchaser the right to sue the manufacturer in assumpsit, on the basis of breach of warranty, for damages incurred by him due to a defect in the quality of the goods. Pennsylvania decisions are in accord with this general proposition. The warranty is personal to the immediate or original buyer, and he alone may avail himself of the benefit thereof. This limitation is based on the rule of privity of contract. See, 1 Williston, Sales, §244, and 77 C.J.S. Sales §305.</p>

Since the enactment of the Code, this right is extended to members of the subpurchaser’s family, his household and guests in his home. If the action is prosecuted in trespass on the basis of negligence, against both the dealer and the manufacturer, and the doctrine of exclusive control is applicable thereto, after the plaintiff offers testimony as to the circumstances of the accident, the duty of coming forward with evidence showing the exercise of due care is upon the defendants: <em>Loch v.
