In evaluating the merit of the question, the testimony must be read in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Deyell, <a href="/pa/399/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1290538" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0563-01">399 Pa. 563</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20448" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="160 A.2d 448">160 A. 2d 448</a> (1960 ).

The test of the sufficiency of the evidence, irrespective of whether it is direct or circumstantial, is whether accepting as true all of the evidence upon which, if believed, the jury could properly have based its verdict, it is sufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged: <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[245,1285,1154,87]]]'>The testimony read in this light may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[238,1393,1160,963]],["BL_541.1",541,[142,358,1150,318]]]'>Juan Otero operated a tailor shop at 56 East Spring Avenue, Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and lived in a small connecting apartment to the rear thereof. Shortly after 9:15 p.m. o’clock on June 14, 1956, Mrs. Isabel Strickland, who lived in an apartment above, heard sounds of a quarrel, scuffling and screams emanating from the apartment connected with the tailor shop below. She went to her bedroom window overlooking a rear entrance leading from the tailor shop premises to an alley, and saw a colored man, whom she did not recognize, start out of the Otero apartment and then immediately re-enter. It was dark and she could not see his face. Within seconds, the same individual came out again. He was dressed in a light “T” shirt, dark trousers, light baseball cap, and carried a paper clothing bag. Immediately alerting neighbors, together with Mrs. Strickland, they hurried to the Otero premises and saw Juan Otero lying on the floor of the kitchen <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>in a pool of blood. No one else was on the premises. Mrs. Strickland called the police at exactly 9:28 p.m. They arrived within minutes and found the victim dead as a result of six stab wounds in his body. Otero had been seen alive by another neighbor about 9:10 p.m. o’clock, standing in front of his tailor shop.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[142,685,1151,697]]]'>Within minutes thereafter, Mrs. Strickland went by automobile to the home of her family, three blocks away. After a very brief stop, she started home again and en route saw a colored man of the same build and appearance as the man she saw leaving the Otero premises. He was walking along the street about a block and one-half from the scene of the killing, still wearing the same type of clothing described, but was not carrying a bag. She reported this fact to the police. At first, when she saw this individual she could not remember his name, but shortly thereafter she realized that it was the defendant, Charles Edward Whiting, and so told the police.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[143,1393,1149,470]]]'>The appellant-defendant was taken into custody and questioned about the killing early the next morning. A search of the room where he lived revealed a white “T” shirt, dark trousers, shorts, socks, a military fatigue cap, shoes and a paper clothing bag. Blood spots and blotches of blood were readily discernible on each of the items of clothing and on the clothing bag. The defendant admitted wearing this clothing on the night before.</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[143,1884,1149,468]]]'>In midmorning of June 15th, the defendant gave a statement to the police wherein he stated that he had been in the Otero tailor shop between 7:30 and 8 o’clock p.m. the night before to pick up some clothes previously left for attention. He said that he received his clothes, departed and did not return. Subsequently, he learned about the assault upon Otero and watched from nearby as the police placed the victim’s body in the ambulance.</p>
    <p id="b542-3" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[250,363,1155,532]]]'>
      <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>Later on the same day, the defendant gave another statement to the police, which was substantially different than the one previously given. Therein, he said he went to the tailor shop at 7:30 p.m., paid for his clothing but decided to leave it there until he was going home. He returned to the shop about 9:30 p.m. o’clock, saw the body of the victim lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He knelt alongside the body, rolled it over, jumped up shaking the blood off his hands, grabbed his clothes and ran out of the rear entrance.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[250,907,1153,205]]]'>He explained his unusual actions as being due to fright and emotional disturbance based upon his recollection of a related experience while serving in the armed forces during the Korean War.</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[248,1122,1156,251]]]'>Laboratory tests disclosed that the specimens of blood found on the clothing, shoes and bag found in defendant’s room were the same blood type as that of the victim and of a different type than that of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.7",542,[243,1394,1159,961]]]'>Certainly, this evidence, when viewed in totality, is amply sufficient to warrant the conclusion of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant argues that it constitutes only a series of suspicious circumstances, proving only that the defendant was on the scene at or about the time of the killing. It adds up to much more than that. The testimony of the witness, Strickland, places the defendant in the death room at the exact time of the killing. Other than the victim no one else was seen on or leaving the premises. The blood on the defendant’s clothing is strong proof that he was there and participated in the knifing. His hurried exit and subsequent false and misleading statements to the police strongly indicate consciousness of guilt. See, <em>Commonwealth v.

Schurtz, </em><a href="/pa/337/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="337 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1197334" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0405-01">337 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20A.2d%20378" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="10 A.2d 378">10 A. 2d 378</a> (1940), and <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[230,466,1162,1289]]]'>Finally, it is argued that the failure of the trial judge to define the crime of burglary or robbery and to explain the defense of alibi, constituted prejudicial error. It is noted that no such requests were made at trial and only a general exception to the charge recorded. Beyond that and more importantly, no such instructions were required. The issue presented to the jury for determination was whether or not the defendant was guilty of a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing. He was not charged or tried for a murder committed in the perpetration of a felony. As to alibi, no such defense was presented. The defendant himself admitted being in close proximity to the scene at the vital time. Alibi is a defense that places the defendant at the relevant time in a different place than the scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party. No such facts are in the record. There is no duty on a trial judge to charge a jury upon law which has no applicability to the presented facts. There must be some relationship between the law upon which an instruction is required and the evidence presented at the trial: <em>Commonwealth v.
