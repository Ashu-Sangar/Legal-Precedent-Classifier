Travelers Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/300/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1125888" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0327-01">300 Pa. 327</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20645" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A. 645">150 A. 645</a> (1930), properly interprets the statute and applies in this case. In the <em>Munhall </em>case, the plaintiff sued in assumpsit as the beneficiary of an alleged contract of life insurance. The husband had made written application, passed the medical examination, and delivered the application, doctor’s certificate and premium check to the carrier. Plaintiff argued that the premium had been accepted and a policy executed by the carrier, but on learning of husband’s death, the carrier would not deliver the policy. The demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint was sustained by the trial court and in affirming, this Court, at pages 333, 334, said in part: “We are of opinion that in addition to what has been said as to plaintiff’s inability to recover, a statute not referred to in the brief on either side in terms prevents oral contracts of life insurance in this State. This Act (Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, article III, section 517, West’s Penna. Statutes (Cumulative Supplement 1928), page 542, section 317), is a re-enactment of the provision of the Act of May 1, 1876, P. L. 53, 56. It provides: ‘Policies of insurance, made or entered into by any . . . company, may be made either with or without the seal thereof, and they shall be subscribed by the president, or such other officer as may be designated by the directors ... for that purpose, and . . . attested by the secretary, and when so subscribed and attested, shall be obligatory on the com<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>pany’ and its effect is that all contracts of life insurance must be in writing (a wise and salutary requirement to prevent fraud) that they shall be subscribed by the president of the company or some other designated officer and be duly attested and when so subscribed and attested, shall be obligatory on the company’. Under this language, a contract of insurance not in writing is not obligatory on the company. Section 410 of the Act of 1921 (West’s Supplement, page 548), which stipulates that no policy shall be issued or delivered unless it contains certain uniform provisions there specified, clearly implies that all contracts of life insurance must be in writing. The State possesses the power to prescribe regulations for the conduct of the insurance business: Com. v. Vrooman, <a href="/pa/164/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="164 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="860288" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0306-01">164 Pa. 306</a>”.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[188,1190,1154,1187]]]'>Appellant attempts to shift the cause of action from one of assumpsit to one of trespass, and if there was a cause of action the shift could be made, but an action of trespass in this case is directly contra to the position taken by this Court in <em>Zayc v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance </em>Co., <a href="/pa/338/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="338 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="1199973" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0426-01">338 Pa. 426</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2034" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="13 A.2d 34">13 A. 2d 34</a> (1940). This case also recognized that life insurance contracts must be in writing in order to be actionable. In the <em>Zayc </em>case, the court in affirming the award of a judgment n.o.v. in favor of the defendant said: “Manifestly appellant’s attempt in this manner to hold the insurer responsible in damages for the amount of a policy because of delay, and thereby to accomplish by indirection that which the law has persistently refused to permit to be done directly, in an action ex contractu, cannot prevail, unless, independently of statute or contract, a legal duty devolved upon the insurance company either to accept or reject the application for insurance within a reasonable time. It is fundamental that negligence and liability therefor cannot be predicated upon a state of facts which does not impose any legal duty”.</p>
