    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.9",195,[184,856,1149,427]]]'>We should terminate this appeal by granting appellee’s motion to quash the appeal since appellant failed to comply with Rule 49 by neglecting to print, in connection with this appeal, matters required by Rule 49 including pertinent pleadings and testimony taken in the form of depositions, as well as the opinion of the court below (which appellant has indicated to us he would not print under any circumstances).</p>
    <p id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.10",195,[183,1293,1150,307]]]'>However, we will finalize these proceedings by a determination on the merits. The order appealed from denied the appellant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings and sustained appellee’s motion to discharge the rule to open judgment.

    <p id="b195-7" data-blocks='[["BL_195.11",195,[180,1618,1150,535]]]'>The main issue raised by the petition to open judgment and the motion for judgment on the pleadings surrounds the factual determination as to whether the Mellon National Bank was required to give a credit of $700,000 on a mortgage note, which mortgage note and accompanying mortgage were assigned to A. J. Aberman, Inc., appellee, and which mortgage note was in default in the payment of interest and principal. It was on this note that judgment was confessed against the appellant in the sum approximating $764,000.</p>
