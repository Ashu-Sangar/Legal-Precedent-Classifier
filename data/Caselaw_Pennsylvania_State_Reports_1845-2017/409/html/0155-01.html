He testified that, under Veterans’ Administration regulations, he was the custodian of its records for the purpose of appearing in court. He further testified that the army medical record of appellee was a part of the Veterans’ Administration records. He stated that the entries on forms 52-A and 8-116 were made by members of the dispensary who would be either the sergeant in charge or the medical officer, after the subject had been examined.

L. 42, No. 35, §§1-4, 28 P.S. §91a-d, or the Federal Official Records Act of May 24, 1951, P. L. 393, §§1-8, 28 P.S. §§121-128. Appellees contend <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>that the army medical records are inadmissible because the identity of the individual who made these records has not been definitely established. They also contend that the general evidential prerequisite of personal knowledge has not been satisfied since there is no direct proof that the maker of the record had personal knowledge of the event recorded. We reject these contentions and conclude that the records are admissible under either act.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[224,848,1154,532]]]'>The Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act states: “A record of an act, condition or event shall, in so far as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.” Act of 1939, May 4, P.

Quite often different individuals have personal knowledge of the various phases of a transaction so that no <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>one individual has knowledge of the entire transaction. In addition, the frequent turnover of personnel often makes it impossible to identify the employee — if it were only one — who took part in the transaction. Under these circumstances, to require the entrant to have personal knowledge of the event recorded, and to require proof of the identity of the recorder, would exclude almost all evidence concerning the activities of large business organizations<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> — a result diametrically opposed to the purpose and spirit of the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act.</p>

[checkers] have in many cases changed and the former ones cannot be found; in the next place, it cannot always be ascertained accurately which . . . [checker] was concerned in each of the transactions represented by hundreds of entries; in the third place, even if they could be ascertained, the production of the scores of... [checkers], to attend court and identify in tedious succession the detailed items of transactions would interrupt and derange the work of the. .. [carrier], and the evidence would usually be obtained at a cost practically prohibitory; and finally, the memory of such persons, when summoned, would afford little real aid.’ 5 Wigmore, Evidence §1530 . . . .” Therefore, as long as someone in the organization has personally observed the event recorded, the evidence should be admitted.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[165,2125,1148,99]],["BL_206.1",206,[242,371,1155,743]]]'>In the instant case the custodian testified that the entries were made by either the sergeant in charge or <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>the medical officer after the examination had taken place. When questioned further, the custodian testified that from. Ms personal experience the entries had been made by the medical officer. Surely one of these individuals must have had knowledge that the appellee complained of neck and back pains. As to the personal knowledge that an X-ray had been taken, again the only reasonable inference is that someone in the hospital organization had personal knowledge of that event. It is extremely unlikely that entries made on the standard form in a regular fashion pursuant to army regulations had no basis in fact. Hence, we conclude that the records are admissible under the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act.</p>

Section 1 of this act states that “[a] book of records regularly kept by any public officer of the United States, when acting under any law or regulation or other authority, is admissible to evidence any matter recorded therein and pertaining to the duties of the office.” Act of May 24, 1951, P.

In the case of records kept in the regular course of business the circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness arises from the regularity with which they are kept. In the case of official records the element of trustworthiness exists for an entirely different reason — the existence of an official duty. 5 Wigmore, Evidence, §1632 at 514 (3d ed. 1940).</p>

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[179,688,1151,971]]]'>Although it is a basic principle of evidence that a witness’s testimony must be based upon personal knowledge, in the case of official records the courts have not required stringent proof of this element. 5 Wigmore, Evidence, §1636 et seq. (3d ed. 1940). Thus, in <em>United States v. Ward, </em><a href="/f2d/173/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="173 F.2d 628" data-case-ids="1178484" data-case-paths="/f2d/173/0628-01">173 F. 2d 628</a>, 629-30 (2d cir. 1949), the court stated in regard to selective service records that: “The main objection to the admission of these records is that the witness did not make the records and did not know when or by whom these particular records were made. . . . [T]o the extent the entries were hearsay, they were admissible as ‘official statements’ made in the course of the entrants’ official duties as employees of United States.” Particularly where military records are offered in evidence, courts have not been very concerned with proof of the source of the information nor of the identity of the maker. 5 Wigmore, Evidence, §1641, §1675a (3d ed. 1940).</p>

Because of the passage of time and the constant turnover of military personnel it is often impossible — as in this case — to definitely identify the maker of the record. Further, the custodian who authenticates these records cannot testify with certainty as to what individual in the military organization had personal knowledge of the event recorded. He can only testify from his experience as to what probably happened. He cannot, of course, testify as to what actually happened. State <em>v. Auld, </em><a href="/njl/135/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="135 N.J.L. 293" data-case-ids="143272" data-case-paths="/njl/135/0293-01">135 N.J.L. 293</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="51 A.2d 215">51 A. 2d 215</a> (1947). We <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>therefore conclude that the testimony of the custodian describing the manner in which these records were prepared is sufficiently definite to admit these records under the Federal Official Records Act.</p>

In that case the court held that hospital records containing <em>medical opinions </em>were properly excluded where there was no assurance that they were approved by qualified physicians. In <em>Hagopian </em>we cited <em>Paxos v.

The entries introduced in evidence were only offered to prove that appellee came to the military hospital to complain about back and neck pains and that he also had an X-ray taken. These records were admitted in evidence for the purpose of proving that appellee complained of pains — not that he was in fact suffering from them. We are dealing <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>with historical facts and not medical opinions and there is therefore no need to ascertain whether the author of these statements was a qualified physician.

Thus, a record made at the direction of the examining physician would be satisfactory under <em>Paceos. </em>The court did not mean to indicate in <em>Paceos </em>that the person actually making the recording must necessarily have knowledge of the event described in the entry, nor did the court in <em>Hagopian </em>intend such an interpretation.</p>
