The building was used for the storage of metal products and subsequently for the manufacture of metal products. On December 23, 1958, prior to (or, as appellant contends, prior to and during) the movement of machinery into the building for the purpose of manufacturing, the City of Butler enacted a zoning ordinance, No. 382, which zoned this distinct Residential. On January 15, 1960, the Zoning Officer ruled that the premises was “M-2 Heavy Industrial” prior to the enactment of the ordinance, with the result that a continuance of the manufacturing operation by the Butler Stamping Company was permitted. In other words, this manufacturing was ruled to be a continuance or a lawful extension of a valid nonconforming use. The Zoning Officer’s decision was affirmed by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Thereupon appellant (an adjoining property owner), within the time <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>limit of thirty days,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County in accordance with the Third Class City Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">**</a> and in conformity with Rule 3 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The requisite papers were filed by the appellant with the Prothonotary within the prescribed period and a copy thereof was delivered to all parties in interest. However, the Prothonotary failed to issue a writ of certiorari to the Zoning Board commanding it within twenty days after service thereof to certify to the Court of Common Pleas its entire record in the matter: Pa. R. C. P. 5. Over a year later the Court of Common Pleas quashed the appeal because no writ of certiorari had been issued and no record was before that Court within the required twenty days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">***</a> From the Order of the Court of Common Pleas which quashed the appeal to that Court, appellant appealed to this Court.</p>
