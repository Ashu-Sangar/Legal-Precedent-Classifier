The Borough of Clarksville consisting of approximately 167.4 acres (before flooding) is annexing a part of South Pymatuning Township consisting of 2,542.6 acres (before flooding).

First, the appellants’ brief alleges that the annexation was illegal because “The <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>petition for annexation signed by the freeholders and the annexation ordinance adopted by the Borough of Clarksville do not describe the same land. In fact, the petition for annexation does not describe <em>any </em>enclosed land area.” The second broad category alleges that the lower court erred in finding that the annexation was proper as being in the public interest.</p>

The first specific error, complained of by the appellants, is the discrepancy in the manner the two descriptions cross Route No. 18. The description in the petition is directed to the west side of Route No. 18 then proceeds to the southwest corner of lands of Koonce Estate, being northwest corner of lands of D. F. Moore. The description as contained in the annexation ordinance (and the map) is directed to the center line of Route No. 18 then to the next point which is apparently common to both descriptions. It therefore appears that the description in the ordinance (and map) contains a right triangle, situate on the west side of Route No. 18, which is not included in the petition-description. From the scale of the map we can approximate the width of Route No. 18 to be 40 feet. This would make the base of the right triangle 20 feet. The side of the triangle is indicated on the map and ordinance-description to be 19.85 feet (or approximately 20 feet), therefore the hypotenuse-would be approximately 28.27 feet. The lower court disregarded this alleged discrepancy on the theory that the apparent contradiction is clearly resolved by the map attached to the petition. The rule which determines whether or not such an alleged discrepancy would invalidate the annexation is expressed in the <em>Salisbury Twp. Annexation Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/172/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="172 Pa. Super. 262" data-case-ids="477174" data-case-paths="/pa-super/172/0262-01">172 Pa.

    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[197,745,1151,969]]]'>In view of the comparative size of the triangle and the annexation of 2642.6 acres, we feel that the discrepancy is minor and may be disregarded. The intent of the parties to include the triangle is obvious from the map and from the fact that the description in the petition generally followed the boundaries of the petitioners. To buttress this position we have the presumption that an ordinance having been adopted by a legislative body is presumably legal and the burden of proving illegality is upon those who aver illegality. <em>Mountainville Election District’s Annexation, </em><a href="/pa/304/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="304 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="1132414" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0559-01">304 Pa. 559</a>, 562, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.%20162" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="156 A. 162">156 Atl. 162</a> (1931). The appellants have not presented any evidence that it was not the intent of the parties to include the triangle as evidenced by the map and ordinance. None of the petitioners presented any objection to the annexation and apparently intended the annexation as depicted by the map and ordinance-description.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[197,1726,1149,641]],["BL_376.1",376,[246,372,1153,151]]]'>The second objection relative to the description alleges that the description in the petition circumscribes a tract of land known as the Koonce Estate and this indicates the Koonce Estate is not a part of the annexation. It is true that the description in the petition does circumscribe the Koonce Estate, however the map attached to the petition eliminates the common boundary of the Koonce Estate and the other annexed area. The very fact that the Koonce Estate was described in the petition (even though it was circumscribed) indicates that it was to be a part of the annexed area. The map which is attached to the petition <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>eliminates any ambiguity. This discrepancy in tbe description is also a minor one and was properly disregarded by the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[234,535,1163,1725]]]'>Tbe final descriptive error alleged by tbe appellants wbicb they feel should invalidate tbe annexation is that tbe petition fails to close by 1050 feet. Tbe description in tbe petition directs a course along tbe north line of South Pymatuning Township to tbe east line of Clarksville. Actually tbe north boundary of South Pymatuning Township intersects tbe northern boundary of Clarksville at a point wbicb is 1050 feet west of tbe northeast corner of tbe Borough of Clarksville. Tbe actual description as contained in tbe petition is as follows: “Westwardly along tbe north line of South Pymatuning Township to tbe east line of tbe present Borough of Clarksville.” Admittedly in traveling to tbe east line of Clarksville you would travel in a general westwardly direction until you come to tbe northern boundary of Clarksville then you would travel in an easterly direction for 1050 feet to tbe east line of Clarksville. It is tbe opinion of this Court that if you follow tbe general description above quoted you would make a <em>continuous </em>line along tbe northerly boundary of South Pymatuning Township to tbe east line of tbe Borough of Clarksville (even though you would travel in an easterly direction for tbe last 1050 feet of tbe directed course). The obvious intent of the parties is expressed by tbe description in tbe petition and again doubt or ambiguity is eliminated by tbe map that was attached to tbe petition. Assuming, arguendo, that this does create a discrepancy, it is still a minor discrepancy and should be disregarded. It is tbe opinion of this Court that the description in petition even without tbe map fixes tbe boundary with reasonable certainty.</p>

    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[194,964,1147,634]]]'>The appellants’ second broad objection is that the lower court erred in finding that the annexation was proper as being in the public interest. The appellants contend that the lower court failed to consider such matters as the irregularity of the western boundary; the comparative size of the annexed and annexing areas; the borough’s motive in enlarging its area; the present inadequate plans for the new area; the difficulty in expanding the lighting facilities; the hardship and disadvantages to the remaining township and the apparent lack of any advantage to the residents of the annexed area.</p>
    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.7",377,[196,1617,1148,744]]]'>Specifically, the appellants’ objection to the creation of an irregular western boundary is — “The drawing of lines in an irregular manner so as to eliminate freeholders who oppose annexation reflects unfavorably upon the propriety of the annexation:” This irregularity of the boundary is actually a creature of our legislative annexation procedure, since the annexation must be instituted by petition of a majority of the freeholders. The boundaries of the land owned by the petitioning freeholders largely determines the irregularity of the new borough boundary. Any requirement on the regularity of the boundary or symmetry of the proposed borough should come from the legislature rather than this Court.</p>

The appellants imply that a borough should not be permitted to annex an area that is larger (population and geographically) than the borough. This limitation should be made by the legislature and not by the courts.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[237,804,1163,1292]]]'>In considering the balance of the appellants’ objections we must be mindful of the fact that the majority of the freeholders are requesting this change of governmental status; that annexation, in most instances, is a necessity caused by municipalities’ increasing need for more area to carry on their expanding governmental service and man’s increasing desire for additional governmental services. For these reasons, this Court will not invalidate an annexation “unless cogent reasons appear in the record.” The precedent which guides us to this decision is set forth in the <em>Lancaster Annexation Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/183/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="183 Pa.
