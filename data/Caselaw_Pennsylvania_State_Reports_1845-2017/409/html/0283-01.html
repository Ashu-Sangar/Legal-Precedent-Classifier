By virtue thereof, 5469 feet of water lines were installed by the West View Water Authority (Authority) under a contract with McCandless Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Authority’s total cost for the installation of these lines was $47,704.43 of which $37,932.99 was charged to the Township in accordance with the Township-Authority contract. The addition of engineering, legal and other costs to the contract price increased the ultimate cost to the Township for the total project to $41,841.48.</p>

The board of viewers (Board), appointed by the court, viewed and examined the area wherein the water lines were constructed and the properties abutting thereon. The Board then prepared a schedule (report) of assessments placing the entire cost of the improvement upon the abutting property owners. This schedule set forth that there were no damages apart from special benefits, that the total cost of the improvement was $41,841.27 and imposed the <em>entire </em>cost upon the abutting property owners <em>charging nothing against the Township. </em>Notice of said schedule and the time and place of its exhibition was served upon all the affected property owners. Ten of the forty assessed property owners filed exceptions to the schedule or report. The Board held a hearing on these exceptions: the record before us is silent as to what transpired at this hearing and we have before us only the briefs of counsel for the respective parties which purport to set forth what took place at this hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After this hearing, the Board <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>filed a new report which simply set forth that there were no damages apart from special benefits, that the total costs of the improvements was $41,841.27 and levied assessments totalling $80,595.50 against the specified property owners in certain specified amounts <em>charging the Township with the difference between the total amount of costs and expenses of saAd improvement and the total amount of such benefits, </em>to wit, $11,-245.77. This report <em>as it appears in the instant record </em>contains no findings of fact on the part of the Board nor any explanation concerning the imposition of costs amounting to $11,245.77 upon the Township.</p>

These exceptions were argued before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and on January 9, 1962 an order was made by that court dismissing the Township’s exceptions and confirming absolutely the report of the Board. From that order the Township took this appeal.</p>

According to the property owners’ brief, at the hearing the thrust of their argument was to the excessive cost of the improvement and was comprised of three matters: (a) that a <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>large amount of the water lines did not benefit any of the properties or the Water District generally, (b) that a large portion of the line abutted upon properties which were benefited by the line but since these properties were not included in the Water District they were not assessed and the cost thereof was placed upon those properties in the Water District and (e) that the faulty layout of the water lines and erroneously located water district boundaries had increased the total cost to the Water District but the resulting increase in costs did not benefit properties within the district.</p>
