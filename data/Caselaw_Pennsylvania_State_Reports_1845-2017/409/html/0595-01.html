The “Reuter Report” is in this category. However, this is a qualified or conditional privilege, rather than absolute. If the newspaper account is fair, accurate and complete, and not published solely for the purpose of causing harm to the person defamed, it is privileged and no responsibility attaches, even though information contained therein is false or inaccurate.

Further, it is not essential that the governmental proceedings or, as in this case, the official report, be set forth verbatim by the newspaper.

The fact that <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>the news article inadvertently omitted the date of birth of the individual actually involved is immaterial and does not warrant a finding of an abuse of the “occasion of privilege.” It is noted that the date of birth of the other individuals mentioned in the article was also omitted.

Nor do I see in this action anything that is involved with a determination that impinges upon any constitutional guarantee, and surely the majority’s observation that this action im<a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>pinges upon the “public’s right to know” is most inaccurate.
