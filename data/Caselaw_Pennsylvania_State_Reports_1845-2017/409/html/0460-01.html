When arraigned before the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Philadelphia County to face trial upon the indictment for the second time (October 28, 1954), Almeida entered a plea of guilty, was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree by the court and sentenced to life imprisonment. No appeal was taken. It is from this sentence and confinement that he seeks his release in this action.</p>

However, a very significant change <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>in the concept of the rule of felony murder was enunciated by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[233,690,1154,196]]]'>It is the contention of the appellant that under the rule of law of <em>Redline, </em>he is not guilty of murder and hence, that his conviction must be declared void and release directed.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[226,908,1159,966]]]'>The legality of the appellant’s conviction is and must be governed by the law of Pennsylvania as it existed at the time of said conviction: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/402/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="402 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="1296688" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0371-01">402 Pa. 371</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="167 A.2d 303">167 A. 2d 303</a> (1961). As of that relevant date, the question of who fired the fatal shot was irrelevant to appellant’s guilt of murder in the first degree, so long as it was fired in aid of or in resistance to the perpetration of the robbery involved. <em>Redline </em>decided several years after the date of appellant’s conviction is not relevant. The lower court, therefore, properly denied the writ requested. It is also noted that the appellant is presently confined under sentence following his conviction for a robbery, separate and distinct from the robbery involved in his murder conviction. While this raises a serious question as to his legal fight to a writ, our conclusion as to the basic question involved obviates any discussion of this issue.</p>
