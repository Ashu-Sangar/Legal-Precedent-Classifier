    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[168,597,1148,421]]]'>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellee, the verdict-winner, we find that about 5:30 p.m. on March 5, 1958, a clear, dry day, appellee was driving north in the center of Third Street towards the intersection of Third and Cumberland Streets. At this point, each of the streets is one-way, 26 feet wide, and has 12 foot sidewalks. The intersection was not controlled by traffic signals at the time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[161,1037,1153,853]]]'>As appellee approached the intersection, he took his foot off the gas pedal thereby reducing his speed to 15 miles per hour. He looked to his right and saw appellant’s car approximately 50 feet away and proceeding west in the center of Cumberland Street at the rate of 15 miles per hour. Deciding that he could safely cross the intersection, appellee, <em>without increasing his rate of </em>speed, went five to eight feet into the intersection when he concluded that he could not clear appellant’s car. Hoping that appellant would see his car in time and drive around it, appellee applied his brakes. However, appellant, whose negligence is conceded, did not see appellee’s car until he was five feet away from it and consequently struck the front of appellee’s car at a point ten feet north of the south curb and 19 feet west of the east curb.</p>

The car entering the intersection from the left has been held contributorily negligent as a matter of law where either the physical facts demonstrate that it is impossible for him to cross the intersection without a collision,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> or where the margin of safety is so narrow that a reasonably prudent man would not test the obvious danger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Since both cars were moving at approximately the same rate of speed, the margin of error was ten feet. A car being driven at 15 miles per hour travels 22 feet per second and accelerates an additional 1.5 feet per second with every one mile per hour increase in speed. Hence, if appellee misjudged in the slightest degree either the distance of appellant’s car or the speed at which it was traveling — as he apparently did — a collision was likely. Under these circumstances, a reasonably prudent man would either abstain from entering the intersection initially, or, once having committed himself to the intersection, would increase his rate of speed to insure clearing the intersection without collision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> If appellee’s decision to apply <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>his brakes was caused by the perilous nature of the situation, that peril was of his own making.
