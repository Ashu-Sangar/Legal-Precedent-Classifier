On March 24, 1960 the board elected him principal of the junior high school in Canonsburg, beginning with the 1959-60 term, at a salary of $7,500 a year for a ten-month term, the salary to be paid over a twelve-month period.</p>

Taggart refused to sign the contract because it did not include an extra month’s compensation, his contention being that his original contract provided that he was entitled to a year’s salary on the basis of nine months’ work, and that therefore if he was compelled to work an extra month he should receive extra compensation for that month.</p>

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[262,468,1156,533]]]'>He, therefore, prayed the court to compel the defendant to tender him a professional employees’ contract which, if it was to be for a term of more than nine months, should make provisions for proportionate compensation covering the additional time.. In addition, he claimed compensation for extra services rendered beyond the announced nine-month period dating back to 1946-47, for a total of $9,166.41 plus $200, which the plaintiff said was withheld “out of the mandated salary for 1959-60, together with interest thereon.”</p>

The defendant averred further that the plaintiff was guilty of laches. The court sustained the preliminary objections, dismissed the complaint, and entered judgment for the defendant.

District, </em>supra, the plaintiff, beginning with 1927, had been employed as instructor of instrumental music, holding a professional employee’s contract to teach. In 1939 he was informed by the secretary of the school board of Bethlehem that he had been elected “ ‘. . . assistant principal of <em>Liberty </em>High School with the title of “dean” for the school year 1939-1940 at a salary of 8420 a year or $35 a month.’ ” In 1940 he was notified that he would no longer be assistant principal and dean. He brought suit in mandamus to compel the school district to pay him as assistant principal and dean. The Superior Court held that his appointment as assistant principal was to a “non-mandated office” in that it was “not included within the category of ‘professional employes’ as defined in section 1201 of the School Code, as amended by the Act of 1939.” The Court said: “The fact that the resolution appointing him ‘assistant to the principal’, or ‘assistant principal’, of a <em>high school, </em>designated as ‘Dean of Liberty High School’, merely added to his duties as teacher of music, (a ‘professional employe’), the exclusive charge of discipline in the school, for which added service he was to receive $420 a year, shows that he was not to be classed as a ‘principal’, within the term ‘professional employe’ as defined in the act; for the minimum an<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>nual salary of a high school principal in second class school districts, who devotes one-half or more of his time to supervision and administration, is three thousand dollars, Act of May 23, 1923, P.

    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[155,684,1152,1123]]]'>The plaintiff adopts the extraordinary position of being a teacher for certain purposes and principal for other purposes. He deems himself a principal in order to obtain the substantial salary paid for that position, but considers himself a teacher where it comes to performing work beyond the normal schedule of a teacher. The person who aspires to the glory and affluence of officialdom must recognize that in the aura of that elevation the clock and sometimes even the calendar drop out of sight. The principal cannot close his desk or his mind to his responsibilities at the end of a teaching day. Even when the school term has come to an end, the summoning bell has been muted, and the voice of the pupil no longer enlivens the air, the principal still hears and feels the movement of the classes, the hum of the study periods, the chalk-writing on the blackboards, the dropping and gathering of books, because he has the responsibility not only of the day but of the term; not only the problems of the present month, but of the month standing on tiptoe ready to take over.</p>
    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.6",85,[154,1826,1150,530]],["BL_86.1",86,[249,364,1161,964]]]'>The principal’s work is never fully done, just as a captain of a ship never really sleeps. Of course, with that extra responsibility goes a stipend which exceeds that of the person who has little or no responsibility. The school principal is entitled to great respect, people tip their hats to him, or should; he has an office, he makes out his own schedule, which is all that it should be. The plaintiff wishes all the perquisites, honors and attention which go with a principal’s position, but he wants to observe a time-clock schedule and to be paid <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>additionally for every fragmentary hour he applies to his responsibilities after the blackboard dust of the day has settled. This is not only not fitting from a professional point of view; it is not in accordance with the law. We affirm what the lower court said in this respect: “The plaintiff holds himself out as a member of a learned profession, capable of discharging administrative and supervisory duties at an executive level and receiving a salary substantially in excess of that of a teacher, but at the same time demanding that for purposes of compensation, he be treated as a teacher and nothing more. The plaintiff’s position is not reasonable. The length of time required for the proper and efficient performance of the principal’s duties during the school year is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the School Board, and that discretion should not be interfered with unless there is a clear abuse. 32 P.L.E. Sec. 3, page 462.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[248,1340,1155,305]]]'>“. . . If the plaintiff’s contentions are sustained in the instant case, he will be receiving on a monthly basis a salary in excess of that of any other principal in the school system. This will obviously seriously interfere with and possibly even disrupt existing policies of the School Board.”</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[244,1665,1158,693]],["BL_87.1",87,[182,360,1148,360]]]'>Aside from every other consideration, the plaintiff would not be entitled to the recovery he claims since he slept on his alleged rights in the matter. In June, 1956, he was aware that the school board had no intention of acceding to his demands for extra compensation based on the theory of extra work done. He did not, however, file his complaint in mandamus until five years later. Although the writ of mandamus issues out of the law side of a court of common pleas, the deliberations attending its issuance are guided by the principles of equity. It would be inequitable to impose on taxpayers the extra amounts claimed by the plaintiff when he was indifferent to their rights by his inattentive<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>ness to Ms own claims. Where public moneys are concerned, budgets are prepared and tax levies instituted based on current obligations. The reaching back to present invoices five years overdue could work havoc to any plan for financing so vital and yet so delicately balanced a program as the administration of the public schools of the Commonwealth.</p>
