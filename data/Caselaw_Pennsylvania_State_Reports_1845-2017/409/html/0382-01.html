Swedloff, and Edward <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>Robinson, a guest in Ms automobile, brought an action in trespass against the Philadelphia Transportation Company. This trespass action was instituted on June 21, 1961, 11% months after Swedloff’s automobile collided with a bus owned by the Philadelphia Transportation Company, the original defendant.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[238,684,1156,522]]]'>The Philadelphia Transportation Company severed B. Barry Swedloff as plaintiff and joined him and Jack G. Swedloff as additional defendants. Jack G. Swedloff had been insured by the American Surety Company. It was alleged that he failed to notify the Surety Company of the accident until after the Philadelphia Transportation Company’s complaint to join the Swedloffs as additional defendants had been served upon them, which was over 14 months after the accident.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[234,1225,1156,969]]]'>At the direction of the Surety Company White &amp; Williams, by Richard W. HopMns, entered an appearance for the additional defendants (the Swedloffs). Thereafter White &amp; Williams, as attorneys for the Swedloffs, addressed interrogatories to Robinson and filed an answer to the complaint of the Philadelphia Transportation Company. Five months after the filing of this answer, White &amp; Williams at the direction of their client, the American Surety Company, filed a petition for a rule on all parties to show cause why they should not be permitted to withdraw their appearance. After a considerable time the Court discharged the rule, because otherwise the plaintiff would have been unduly prejudiced by delay (the case having been ordered on the trial list) and the interest of the additional defendants would be prejudiced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> From this Order of the Court the present appeal was taken by Richard W. Hopkins.</p>

      <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>We believe that sometimes too little consideration is given to the rights and privileges of an attorney at law to represent clients of his choice and to terminate a lawyer-client representation when he desires, provided it will not unjustly prejudice the rights of his client. Permitting counsel’s withdrawal at the direction of the Surety Company in no way prejudices the insured (Swedloff) with regard to the question of coverage : <em>Kelly v.

    <p id="b431-4" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[178,1013,1149,469]]]'>It is a fair deduction from the record that the reason for White &amp; Williams’ and Hopkins’ petition for leave to withdraw was to enable the Surety Company to avoid its contract of insurance with Jack G. Swedloff because of the latter’s alleged failure for over fourteen months to notify the Company of the accident. However, all parties agree that this question and this defense are not presently before this Court and were not before the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Under these facts and circumstances we conclude (1) that an attorney has a lawful right to represent in his sole discretion (a) only a client of his choice and (b) only if he is satisfied with the compensation arrangement for his services, and that right is entitled to be protected by the Courts, and (2) that no harm can result to any of the parties if an Order is entered making the rule absolute, without prejudice to any rights any party may have against the American Surety Company.</p>
