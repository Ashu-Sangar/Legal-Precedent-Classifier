He instituted this action for damages against the supplier of the equipment. The latter joined plaintiff’s employer as an additional defendant. At trial, the jury awarded plaintiff a substantial verdict against the original defendant. . The additional defendant was exonerated by the ".jury. Post trial, the court below directed a new trial between the plaintiff and the original defendant, limited to the question of damages. From this order, the plaintiff appeals. The original defendant appeals from the orders of the court denying judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict and refusing to direct that the additional defendant be a party to the second trial.</p>

These were connected by walkways, consisting of two “picks” running from one tower to another. Each “pick” was 22 feet long, 1 foot wide, made of wood with slats as the walking surface, supported by rungs underneath which doweled into the side rails. Each side rail was reinforced with a steel rod running lengthwise.</p>

It was then securely tied down to the steel framework of the tower on the work side, while plaintiff’s fellow employee sat on the “pick” at the opposite side of the tower in order to hold the “pick” firm. At this juncture, the 22 foot “pick” projected out 4 or 5 feet on the side where plaintiff was working, with 7 feet of its length supported by the tower itself and with 10 feet <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>extending out on the opposite side of the tower. When the plaintiff stepped out 2 or 3 feet on the projected portion of the “pick” to paint, it suddenly snapped off and he was plummeted with great force to the floor and pews beneath. He suffered painful and very serious permanent injuries.</p>

The day of the accident was the very first occasion he had cause to use it. The lighting in the church furnished by chandeliers, which hung far below the heighth of the temporarily erected towers upon which the plaintiff was working, cast their light downward towards the floor. The fact that he did not see or observe the existing defect in the particular “pick” is readily understandable. To expect him to do so would be unreasonable.</p>

The answer to this is that the particular use of the “pick” made by the plaintiff at the time of the accident was not unusual, but rather the customary and the usual practice followed by other such tradesmen in like situations. Several witnesses testified to this fact. Not one offered contradiction. This is what is known in the trade as a “thrustout.” The Department of Labor and Industry of the Commonwealth recognizes that such a practice is followed, as is indicated by a provision in relation thereto in its Regulations for Construction and Repairs. These regulations provide for the use of life belts and life lines where workmen “crawl out on thrustouts” or projecting beams. However, the evidence was unanimous in this <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>case that, under the prevailing conditions, the use of these safety measures would be impractical and imperil rather than insure the safety of the plaintiff.</p>
