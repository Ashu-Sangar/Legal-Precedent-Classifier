The bids were opened on May 18, 1955 and appellant was the successful bidder. On May 31, 1955 Gasparini and the Commission signed a written contract whereby Gasparini was to construct, in Luzerne County, the part of the Turnpike known as Section 37-1. Appellant was to commence work when ordered to do so by the appellee and was to have the work completed on or before September 1, 1956.</p>

This movement of earth was rather extensive in some parts of the section, and it was necessary to have sufficient equipment of the proper kind deployed on the right of way. The direction of the flow of material excavated to make the fills or embankments was determined by balance areas where the excavating was being done. The movement of the earth from the place of excavation, either north or south, required the availability of an area of fill or embankment to receive it. The terrain on which the work was being done and the quantity and distances the eárth could be moved most efficiently regulated the establishment of balance areas.</p>

Gasparini avers that the ‘No Damages’ clause in Paragraph 20 of the Special Conditions of the contract does not preclude it from recovery on its Claims Nos. 1, 4 and 5 and that accordingly the matter should be re-submitted to the Arbitrators for further proceedings. On the other hand, the Turnpike Commission contends that these claims should be denied because Paragraph 20 contains a specific <em>‘No Damages’ </em>clause applicable to the delays involved in these claims and that Gasparini was put on <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>notice by the provisions of the contract that other contractors would, be working in the same area.”</p>

The appellant was given formal notice to begin work on <em>June 6, 1955, </em>and to finish the project in compliance with the contract by September 1, 1956. Gasparini was required to have on the job a minimum amount of equipment to do the work adequately and to meet the completion date. The work site was not available to Gasparini, after having been ordered to start work, until <em>November 30,1955. </em>The appellee was aware of the engineering procedures required to bring the right of way to proper grade and the magnitude of the cuts and fills to be made. It also knew Manu-Mine would be occupying the area to the exclusion of Gasparini and in face of this knowledge ordered Gasparini to start operations when the work site was denied. It cannot rely on the provision (Para. 20) providing for no damages for delay caused by the slushing contractor when appellee ordered appellant to proceed under the contract. The appellant was justified in believing, when ordered to begin work, it could go ahead with its work in cooperation with other contractors “as required by a predetermined program of the Commission, [as] contracts for other work in connection with the Turnpike will be in progress concurrently with this contract” (Special Conditions) and “[t]he Contractor shall, therefore, plan and conduct his operations in such a manner as to cause a minimum of interference with the slushing operation.” (Para. 20).

There was a delay due to difficulty with construction of a pier by the foundation contractor and this caused delay in erecting the foundation of the bridge. This delay was apparent, however, the State ordered American Bridge Co. to proceed with the fabrication of the steel for the superstructure. The steel had to be stored outdoors awaiting erection and required repainting at an additional expense. There was a provision in the contract <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>for an extension of time to be given the contractor if the piers were not constructed on time and a further provision which stated it was “ ‘expressly understood and agreed that no claim shall be made against the State for any damages due to delays in the completion of the Main Piers which are constructed under another contract’ ”. The claim was allowed, as the State in ordering fabrication of the steel when delay was apparent was actively and unnecessarily interfering with the American Bridge Co. work.
