At that time Allegheny County was engaged in a reconstruction of that highway, the work of reconstruction being performed by Sanctis under the direction of the County. None of Zilka’s property was taken for the highway purposes but Sanctis had secured from Zilka, in the form of a general written release, permission to enter upon Zilka’s property for the purpose of grading, filling and levelling the surface of the highway.</p>

On September 6th, Sanctis, with Zilka’s acquiescence, pushed over two trees on Zilka’s land with a bulldozer and rolled the trees into a ravine or gully which lay between the highway and Zilka’s home. Toward the end of that day two men representing Sanctis informed Zilka that, before any more fill could be placed in front of his property, the branches on the two fallen trees would have to be trimmed and, inasmuch as Sanctis had no available man to perform this work, Zilka would have to trim the branches. On September 7th, Zilka, using a brush axe,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> trimmed the branches <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>from these trees, completing such work prior to the time Sanctis commenced its operations.</p>

In particular, Zilka watched Sanctis’ bull<em>dozer </em>— 30 <em>to 35 feet distant from where Zilka </em>stood— being operated by Sanctis’ employee Turner known to Zilka as “Sonny”. Zilka testified that he had waved at Turner and Turner had waved back at him. Under the testimony of <em>Zilka </em>— the <em>only eyewitness </em>— the bulldozer, operating in the gully or ravine, was making “passes” and spinning around and, in the course of so doing, hit a group of trees lying in the gully or ravine and a tree or part thereof flew up and hit him. Zilka sustained, as the result of this blow, numerous lacerations and injuries, including the loss of vision in his left eye.</p>

Okay, at the time that he was running his bulldozer back and forth, up and down this road, moving the dirt around, were there any trees in this— A. (Interposing) Yes, sir. Q. (Continuing) — in this gully? A. Yes, there were a considerable number of trees that had been cut from about a month previously; some of them had been cut earlier, some of them were knocked down even a day or so prior to this and there was a lot of trees strewn all through that gully. Some of them were cut and some of them were knocked out with roots and all, they were laying down in through that gully all the way. Q. Okay. How close were these trees that were laying on the ground or in this ravine, how close were those trees in reference to where Sonny was running this bulldozer? A. Well, you mean where he was making his passes up and down? Q. Yes. A. Well, I say that some of the trunks of the trees probably were within a couple of foot of the fill that he was putting in. Q. All right, and how far were you standing, by the way, from where the bulldozer was operating if <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>you know, in a direct line distance, if you know?

A. <em>Well, as I was standing there on that side of the gully where my house is, about side foot down, the bulldozer was working across from me on the other side, as he was making these passes around, whipping the bulldozer around, as they do, you know, they can spin those things around on a dime, he spun it around and hit these trees and as the trees rolled over, one tree came up at me. I never, didn’t have a chance to duck out of the way or anything, I just got hit. Q. Do you know what hit the tree, Mr. Zilka? A. The bulldozer hit the tree, the blade of the bulldozer hit the trees.

And the truth of the matter, Mr. Zilka, as you said that first time you were asked, is that you really don’t know what tree it was that hit you or where it came from? A. Not the specific tree, no, but it was out of this bunch that he hit with the blade, come up at me, it was one that hit me. I can’t point out the tree and say, ‘This is the one, this big around.’ <em>And, of course, I ivould say, well, one of the trees it was a tree that hit me that come up out of that pile as he hit it, as he spun over the trees rolled and these trees come at me before I had a chance to even figure I was getting hit or what. </em>That’s it, I didn’t remember anything any more, I don’t recall anything, as I said until Sunday after that.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

Viewed most favorably in Zilka’s <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>favor, the record indicates that the bulldozer was in the gully or ravine where it had the right to be, that it was engaged in an operation not inherently dangerous or hazardous, that it was making “passes”, “whipping . . . around” and “spinning”, all of which are normal, usual, and standard practice in bulldozer operations and that the bulldozer blade hit a tree, a fact neither unusual or extraordinary. The record further indicates that, when the bulldozer hit <em>a </em>tree, <em>some </em>tree or <em>some </em>part thereof — undescribed as to size, location on the ground or distance from Zilka — struck Zilka then standing 30 to 35 feet from the point at which the bulldozer was in operation.</p>

We cannot infer from the fact that a tree or a part thereof struck Zilka that the operation of the bulldozer was negligently performed particularly when, under Zilka’s own testimony, there is not a scintilla of evidence of negligence in the operation of the bulldozer. It was incumbent on Zilka to prove that the blow struck him by a tree, or a part thereof, arose from an improper or careless operation of the bulldozer and that he was within the “orbit of danger” arising from <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the operation of the bulldozer; on both counts, Zilka failed to sustain his burden of proof.</p>

In entering judgment in favor of the defendant, this Court said (p. 16): “Where was the negligence? The result was not a probable consequence of [the employee’s] act in mixing the mortar with the hoe; the most that could be said of it is, that the consequence was very remotely possible, so remotely, that it is one which in the ordinary affairs of life the most careful men do not anticipate and make provision against.” In <em>Rockey v. Ernest, </em>supra, decedent was laying a pipe 20 to 25 feet distant from a point where a bulldozer was in operation when the bulldozer struck a stone which snapped from under the bulldozer, flew a distance of 20 to 25 feet and struck decedent in the head. This Court stated (pp. 541, 542) : “There was no evidence that defendant operated the bulldozer negligently or in an unusual or improper manner; and it is clear that the accident was a remote possibility and not the natural and probable consequence of a bulldozer running over a stone.

One Wilson, the bulldozer operator, was pushing a considerable amount of cut trees, stumps and brush when a tree which was being pushed struck a stump which caused the tree to swing around and fly a distance of 15 feet where it struck Griffin who had been standing in the wooded area.

There is no evidence on this record which tends to show that the defendant Wilson operated the bulldozer negligently or in an unusual or improper manner, or that in its operation there were any facts or circumstances from which negligence on his part may be legitimately inferred. [Citing cases including <em>Rockey v. </em>Ernest, supra.] In our opinion, the evidence does not show facts sufficient to warrant the inference that the operator of the bulldozer could reasonably have foreseen that the sapling, which was being pushed along with a pile of other saplings, brush and rubbish, would fly out and injure [Griffin], who was standing in the woods and off of the right of way.”</p>

A grave loss has been sustained by Emil J. Zilka and, if the law deprives him of what he is entitled to, a grave injustice has been perpetrated. I believe that we are dealing here with a grave injustice.</p>

Turner, who was employed by the Sanctis Construction Co., the defendant in this case, was operating a bulldozer on a road construction job in the vicinity of the plaintiff’s house. For several days he had been using his bulldozer to knock down trees and push them into a gulley which separated the plaintiff’s home from the arena of the bulldozer’s operations. On the day of the accident he was maneuvering these trees and others, some still alive, into position to make fill for the ravine which would eventually become an integral part of the contemplated highway development on which he was working. Whether Turner was a skilled bulldozer operator or not is a question of fact in this litigation. In striking down some oaks he collided with one in such a fashion that he damaged a power line. The impact of the bulldozer blade with that particular tree hurled it into the wires, and the branches became so entangled in them that a member of the work crew had to climb up to the point of entanglement and saw off a limb to free the tree. Turner’s explanation of this mishap was that he <em>did not see </em>the wires.</p>

It says that “the mere happening of an accident is not evidence of negligence.” But this was not a mere happening. The evidence showed that Turner was aware that the plaintiff was within the area of the catapulting potentialities of his machine— a D-8 Caterpillar, 26-ton bulldozer — and he knew that unless he exercised the care required by the circumstances, a serious accident could occur. ITe knew that only a day or two before, he had brought down a power line because he was careless. He was thus put on notice not to be careless again. The trial judge properly submitted to the jury the question as to whether the operator was negligent in causing the accident which befell Zilka. The jury decided that Turner was indeed careless, perhaps even reckless, and returned a verdict of $30,000 against the defendant company, a modest sum for the loss of one-half of the paradise of living.</p>

It is to say that a locomotive, or a concrete mixer, or an automatic meat slicer is not inherently dangerous. The most desultory glance at a bulldozer in furious function reveals it to be an awesome gigantic piece of machinery with tractor treads massive as the wheels of a juggernaut; one can also see that it possesses the blade of a guillotine, the power of a steam engine, and the thrust of a battering ram. A bulldozer is capable of demolishing dwellings, reducing industrial structures to twisted steel and kindling, moving hills, and cutting into the surface of the earth with the destructive incisiveness of an earthquake.</p>

Turner knew that only 35 feet separated him from a helpless human being. He knew the momentous force produced by the machine responding to his will.

Is there nothing unusual about a bulldozer converting that tree into a missile, rocketing it through the air 35 feet? Is there nothing extraordinary about a bulldozer operator completely overlooking the nature of his surroundings and carrying on as if he were at Cape Canaveral, instead of in a residential area? Is it not extraordinary that a tree should be soaring disconnectedly in space? Trees invariably take root downward and then grow upward ; they do not ever take wing, they do not of their own volition fly through the air, they do not become rockets, they do not turn into huge arrows to pluck out the eyes of people in their own front yards.</p>

Zilka was waiting in the yard for his wife to get dressed for the trip and, while waiting, he watched the bulldozer which was separated from him by a ravine.

The Majority keeps asking, as if it were posing the riddle of the sphinx: What was Turner doing that was wrong? The answer is written in every leaf and on every twig of that flying tree. Turner used too much power in applying the blade of his bulldozer to the object in his path. When an automobile strikes a pedestrian with such force that it hurls him into a trajectory which does not terminate until the victim lands on the macadam 35 feet away, it does not require the genius of an Einstein to figure out that the automobile was traveling at a high rate of speed. When a bulldozer hurls a tree — with roots, trunk and branches <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>—35 feet, what logical conclusion can there be but that the force applied to the bulldozer blade was excessive?</p>

The law in its wisdom has declared for over a century that where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.’ ”</p>
