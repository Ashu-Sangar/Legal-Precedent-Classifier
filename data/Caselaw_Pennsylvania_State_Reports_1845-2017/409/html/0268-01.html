Railroad tracks. They testified that when they arrived at that address two minutes later, they found a Mrs. Barbara Martin, aged 76, who had been “brutally beaten”. She had two black eyes, a swollen chin, severe lacerations and bumps all over her face, she was bleeding about her face, nose and one arm, and <em>she was in a hysterical condition. </em>She told them she thought her arm and shoulder were broken.</p>

The assailant then took her handbag (containing $2 and a fifth of whiskey) from her. She had been returning home from a visit to a drug store at 11th Street and Braddock Avenue, a distance of about 500 yards from the tracks and after the assault had dragged herself to Mrs. Kotvas’ home at 226 Halket Avenue, which was the nearest dwelling house.</p>

An autopsy was performed by a pathologist who testified that death resulted from a “subdural and subarachnoid intercranial hemorrhage and cerebral necrosis following contusions of the face and body.” According to the pathologist, the hemorrhages were the result of the application of severe and extensive force and that they could not have been caused by a fall “unless she would fall from a high place and meeting obstructions on the way down, . . . because the bruises were too widely distributed.”</p>

On March 20, 1961, he was interrogated for several hours at the Allegheny County Detective Bureau. At first he denied <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>any connection with the assault of Mrs. Martin, hut after several hours made orally and thereafter signed a full confession. In this confession he denied striking Mrs. Martin but admitted “bumping” her “pretty hard”, and said that as a result she fell on her face, and that he then took her pocketbook and whiskey. After stating these facts orally, defendant informed his interrogators that he could read and write “only a little bit,” and consequently he wanted the statement read to him when it was written. When the statement was transcribed, it was read to defendant by James B. DeStout, Chief of Allegheny County Detectives, in the presence of several other detectives, a reporter and a radio commentator. Defendant requested that the written statement be changed in respect to the bottle of whiskey, and after this had been corrected, he signed the written statement. All the witnesses to defendant’s oral and written statements testified that when he made them he appeared to be normal and had even requested the correction in the written statement above mentioned.</p>

He recalled the “walk-through”, but denied knowing where Mrs. Martin had been attacked. He also testified that the photographs were taken after he had been told to point to <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>particular locations. Defendant produced testimony that when tested at school several years previous to his trial, he had an I.Q. of 46 and a mental age of approximately <em>6y2 </em>years.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[246,609,1156,685]]]'>Defendant raises several important questions. The first is that the statement taken by the officers from Mrs. Martin was inadmissible. The Court had admitted it as part of the res gestae. Defendant contends that Mrs. Martin’s oral statement was not spontaneous, but on the contrary consisted of a narrative which was the result of reflection and premeditation or design; that it was made at least five minutes after the attack and at a place 100 yards from the place of the crime; and that she had the presence of mind and normality of condition to describe her assailant in the Slovakian language (out of apparent deference to Officer Reaves). There is no merit in this contention.</p>
