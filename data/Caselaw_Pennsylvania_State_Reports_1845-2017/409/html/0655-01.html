    <p id="b703-3" data-blocks='[["BL_703.4",703,[185,459,1148,426]]]'>This case involves a 17-room (with five baths), three-story house at 6012 Drexel Boad, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This property is situate in a district classified as <em>“A” </em>Residential. The applicable zoning ordinance of 1933<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> permits detached single-family dwellings in a district zoned “A” Residential. This house is and since at least 1935 has been occupied and used as a five unit multi-family dwelling.</p>
    <p id="b703-4" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[186,894,1148,316]]]'>C. Walter Sheedy and Gertrude Marie Sheedy, his wife, purchased this property in 1952, at which time they believed in good faith and were justified in believing that its then existing and prior long continued use was a lawful use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> This belief was based upon and supported by the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[187,1221,1149,748]],["BL_704.1",704,[237,350,1153,143]]]'>The Sheedys were apprised of the fact that the Zoning Board of Adjustment had refused in 1945 to grant the previous owner a variance for a seven unit dwelling. At that time, the Board made no order and gave no warning that it considered the five unit dwelling was a violation of the 1933 ordinance. Subsequent to the Board’s refusal to grant a seven unit variance, the house continued to be used and occupied as a five unit multi-family dwelling. When the Sheedys purchased this property in 1952, <em>no action had been taken </em>against its former owners to challenge or stop its alleged illegal use. Moreover, it was <em>not until May .1958 </em>that the Sheedys were ordered to correct the alleged violation of the 1933 ordinance. They were required to cor<a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>rect the alleged violation by June 9, 1958, or file an application — for what purpose does not appear from the record.</p>
    <p id="b704-4" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[234,512,1156,422]]]'>The Sheedys thereupon applied to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for a permit for a five family dwelling and at the hearing before the Board attempted to establish both a nonconforming use and a variance. Several protestants testified that the property was used as a single family dwelling on August 10, 1933 and for a considerable time thereafter. The Board denied the application.</p>
    <p id="b704-5" data-blocks='[["BL_704.6",704,[229,946,1158,638]]]'>In 1960, applicants again sought a variance for a five family dwelling. The Board refused to hear the case on the ground that Begulation III (10)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> had not been complied with. Upon appeal to the court of common pleas that court, on September 18, 1961, ordered the Board to hear the application for a variance. The application was denied by the Board. On January 31, 1962, the court of common pleas made absolute the rule for a supersedeas and refused the motion to dismiss. On April 17, 1962, the court of common pleas affirmed the Zoning Board’s refusal of a variance. On May 8, 1962, the Sheedys appealed to this Court.</p>
