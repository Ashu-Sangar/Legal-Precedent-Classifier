The gravamen of the offense, according to the judge, was “statements by the defendant were made falsely, wilfully and intentionally and with the deliberate intent and purpose to deceive the court and thereby obstruct the administration of justice”. It is difficult to perceive in what manner justice was obstructed when the defendant received a sentence in excess of the maximum limit provided by the statute. Nor did the subsequent hearing on the judge’s “Specification of Charges in Be Contempt of Court” substantiate the charges. The procedure of interrogating the defendant prior to sentence, preferring charges of contempt based on answers given in a respectful manner, but found to be at variance by the judge with his own unrevealed notes of defendant’s answers, and then sentencing defendant for contempt of court is repugnant to the concept of impartial jurisprudence.</p>

This Court said in <em>Knaus v. Knaus, </em><a href="/pa/387/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="387 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1271028" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0370-01">387 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20669" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="127 A.2d 669">127 A. 2d 669</a> (1956), page 376: “The dominant purpose of a contempt proceeding determines whether it is civil or criminal. If the dominant purpose is to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court and to protect the interest of the general public, it is a proceeding for criminal contempt. But where the act of contempt complained of is the refusal to do or refrain from doing some act ordered or prohibited primarily for the benefit of a private party, proceedings to enforce compliance with the decree of the court are civil in nature. The purpose of a civil contempt proceeding is remedial, and judicial sanctions are employed (1) to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court’s order, and (2) in some instances to compensate the complainant for losses sustained: United States v.
