Motivated by a desire to obtain this money, Thomas entered into a conspiracy with [DeMoss], a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, [Ellsworth] and [Wilson] to rob Mrs. Rossman. In 1918, Thomas, then a Tulsa police officer, with DeMoss, had arrested and testified against both Ellsworth and Wilson when they were charged and convicted of 2nd degree burglary. In pursuance of the conspiracy, the Commonwealth contends, Ellsworth and Wilson went to Philadelphia and in the early evening of July 3, 1955 caused Mrs. Rossman’s death by strangulation and took from her room a considerable amount of money.”: <em>Commonwealth v.

At the time such declarations were made Ellsworth was in jail in Memphis. As set forth in the opinion of the court below, Nixon testified “that Wilson conversed with him over a period of several days, that he tried to get a bond for Nixon’s release so Nixon could go to Florida and procure certain witnesses for Wilson’s extradition hearing on the charge against him in Philadelphia. These witnesses would swear that Wilson and Ellsworth were in a taproom in Tampa around the time of the robbery-murder, according to the testimony by Nixon about Wilson’s statement to him. Nixon also testified that Wilson gradually told him <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>all about the crime, and that Ellsworth had gotten ‘rambunctious’ and killed Mrs. Rossman when she made some sort of disturbance.” An examination of Nixon’s testimony clearly indicates that Wilson in his statements to Nixon implicated Ellsworth in the robbery and murder and revealed his plan to establish an alibi both for Ellsworth and himself. Such testimony was highly prejudicial to Ellsworth; if its reception into evidence was error, such error demands a reversal of the judgment of sentence against Ellsworth.</p>

In. <em>Wagner, </em>supra, we said: “The declarations of a coconspirator are evidence against the others, only as long as the conspiracy continues; if made after-wards . . ., they are not evidence . . . .” (p. 499) With these legal principles both the Commonwealth and the defendant are in accord; the area of their disagreement arises in the applicability of these principles to the facts in the case at bar.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[238,853,1156,478]]]'>An examination of the instant record readily reveals that the Commonwealth sustained its burden of proving the first prerequisite to the introduction of Wilson’s statements, i.e., that there was a conspiracy in which not only Thomas and DeMoss but also Wilson and Ellsworth were fellow conspirators. While the defendant does not concede that a conspiracy was proved, he does not, for the purpose of this argument, seriously dispute such proof.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[235,1342,1157,850]]]'>The more serious and important question is whether at the time Wilson made the alleged statements to Nixon the conspiracy was in being or had terminated. The Commonwealth contends that, while generally the commission of the crime which was the object of the conspiracy will mark the termination of the conspiracy, there are conspiracies which involve the commission of a crime wherein the object of the conspiracy will not be attained by the commission of the crime itself, i.e., where the proceeds of a crime have not yet been secured, where the proceeds of a crime have been secured but not divided, etc.: 22A C.J.S. Criminal Law §770. With that general proposition we agree but our problem is to determine whether the conspiracy in the ease at bar had <em>in fact </em>been terminated at the time Wilson made his statements.</p>
    <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.7",556,[234,2211,1155,154]],["BL_557.1",557,[169,344,1150,1348]]]'>' The goal of the conspiracy was the robbery of Mrs. Rossman and all the events which transpired and all the actions of the conspirators were motivated by the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>attainment of that goal. Sncli goal encompassed the robbery itself, the proceeds of the robbery and the division between the conspirators of the proceeds. Of course, in attaining such goal it was inherent in the conspiracy that all appropriate steps be taken, before and after the robbery, to avoid the detection of any of the conspirators. At the time Wilson made his statement to Nixon the robbery had been completed and its success established by the large amount of money secured. The Commonwealth contends that, although all the conspirators met in Florida immediately after the robbery and although Thomas and DeMoss may have received their shares of the proceeds, yet as between Ellsworth and Wilson there had not been a division of the proceeds. In line with that argument the Commonwealth points to the evidence that Ellsworth and Wilson travelled westward together, that the $69,000 found in the Las Vegas hotel room was in a room jointly occupied by them and that they were in Las Vegas to exchange “hot” money for “safe” money before a division took place. The defendant takes the position that, accepting as he must the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence clearly reveals a division of the proceeds between all the conspirators in Florida.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In its opinion there had been no split between Wilson and Ellsworth of the “loot” from the robbery, the money was still in their joint possession, Wilson and Ellsworth were still engaged in joint efforts to exchange “what could be well <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>identifiable money into money which could not be traced” and that even Wilson’s attempt to set up an alibi for Ellsworth and himself was all part of a continuing conspiracy. We do not so read this record. In our view, this conspiracy had come to an end, if not before, certainly at the time of the arrests and incarcerations of both Wilson and Ellsworth in connection with this crime. Even if Wilson was attempting while in jail to set up an alibi for himself and Ells-worth such efforts were not in continuance of the old, but in the commencement of a new, conspiracy.</p>
