The total of the three judgments was $21,817.63 each entered by virtue of warrants of attorney to confess judgment contained in written equipment rental agreements and steel piling rental agreements dated in October, 1960 and the calendar year 1961.</p>

    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[247,527,1154,423]]]'>The petition to strike each judgment avers two reasons: (1) lack of authority by the parties executing the agreements to sign on behalf of the defendant; and (2) the warrants to confess judgment were contained on the reverse side of each of the agreements, and defendant did not realize it was authorizing a warrant to confess while the signatures were on the face of the agreements.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[245,963,1154,149]]]'>We will discuss the second above quoted reason, because it establishes sufficient cause for striking the judgments.</p>

This Contract and all teems and conditions, rights and remedies herein contained and set forth on the bevebse side hereof shall bind the parties hereto, their heirs and each of their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. . . .” The signatures of the parties followed this language.</p>

It is to be further noted that the print on the reverse side of each agreement is the same size as that on the face side, and that signatures of either or both parties appear only on the face of each instrument which does not include nor mention a warrant of attorney.</p>
    <p id="b367-7" data-blocks='[["BL_367.8",367,[204,2018,1148,315]]]'>It is the contention of the appellant that it is immatexial where such an agreement is signed so long as the writing contains the intentions of the parties thereto.

Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Jones said (p. 216) : “. . . Where a lease contains a warrant of attorney, the signature of the lessee must bear such direct relation to the provision authorizing the warrant as to leave no doubt that the lessee signed, conscious of the fact that he was thereby conferring upon the lessor a warrant to confess judgment against him for a breach of a covenant of the lease. <em>A general reference in the body of an executed lease to terms and conditions to be found outside the agreement is insufficient to bind the lessee to a warrant of attorney not contained in the body of the lease unless the lessee signs the warrant where it does appear. In short, a warrant of attorney to confess judgment is not to be foisted upon anyone by implication or by general and nonspecific reference.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>
