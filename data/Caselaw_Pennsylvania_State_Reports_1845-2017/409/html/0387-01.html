On January 16, 1961, Harold A. Hosier, President of the International Mailers Union, hereinafter called I.M.U., appointed Sidney Ginsberg as Trustee of the P.M.U. Ginsberg temporarily suspended Sagot as President-Business Representative of P.M.U. pending the outcome of a hearing scheduled for February 14, 1961. A hearing was held on the aforementioned date and on February 22, 1961, Hosier decided to continue the Trusteeship for an indefinite period of time.

He followed all the procedural rules and pursued and exhausted all the internal remedies required by the Bylaws of the Union.</p>
