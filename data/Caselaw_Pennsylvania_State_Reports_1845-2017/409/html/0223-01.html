    <p id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.12",270,[243,1027,1158,531]]]'>This is a trespass action for personal injuries to a minor plaintiff, Richard Menyo, brought by his mother and. father as parents and guardians, and in their own right. He claimed to have suffered the injuries to his leg and back when he was struck by a motor vehicle operated by the defendant-appellee, Catherine Sphar.. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and plaintiff’s motion for a new trial was dismissed by the court en banc. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment which was entered on the verdict.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

At the intersection of McKean Avenue and Second Street, she <em>started </em>to make a left-hand turn. From that point on the evidence was conflicting. Plaintiffs contend that defendant failed to make the corner and hit the minor <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>plaintiff, as well as the traffic light. Defendant testified that just as she started, after she had stopped her car, plaintiff jumped on to the street in front of her. The conflicting evidence was obviously a question for the jury and the trial Judge and the lower Court believed that the weight of the evidence was, as the jury found, for defendant.</p>
