Approximately three and one-half months prior to his death, decedent transferred a $37,000 bond of the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America to his son by a prior marriage, under the Pennsylvania Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, Act of June 21, 1957, P. L. 358, §1 <em>et seq., as amended, </em>20 P.S. §3601 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. 1971), wherein decedent named himself as custodian. By court appointment, decedent’s divorced wife became successor custodian of the bond for her son<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and one Irwin Kraus was appointed guardian of the son’s estate. Thereafter, appellee elected to take against the will pursuant to the Wills Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, §8, us <em>amended, </em>20 P.S. §180.8 (Supp. 1971), as well as against all inter vivos conveyances, including the bond in question, under the Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, §11, <em>as amended, </em>20 P.S. §301.11 (Supp. 1971). The Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County considered the transfer of the bond by decedent as a “testamentary disposition” and determined that appellee was entitled to one half the value of the bond and all income derived therefrom. Appellants, the court-<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>appointed custodian and the guardian of the son’s estate, filed this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[188,427,1160,1431]]]'>The overall issue presented by this appeal—one of first impression—is whether a corporate bond purchased by a decedent and registered in his name as custodian for his son under Pennsylvania’s Uniform Gifts to Minors Act is subject to the widow’s election under Section 11 of the Estates Act. Section 11 of the Estates Act of 1947 provides in pertinent part: <em>“A </em>conveyance of assets by a person who retains a power of appointment by will, or <em>a poioer of </em>revocation or <em>consumption </em>over the principal thereof, shall at the election of his surviving spouse, be treated as a testamentary disposition so far as the surviving spouse is concerned to the extent to which the power has been reserved . . . .” (Emphasis added). Section 5(b) of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act grants the custodian the power to pay over to the minor or use the custodial property for the benefit of the minor at the discretion of the custodian “with or without regard to the duty of himself or of any other person to support the minor or his ability to do so.” The precise issue before us is whether the statutory authority given a custodian to use the custodial property “with or without regard” to his duty to support the minor constitutes a “power of . . . consumption” under Section ll of the Estates Act of 1947 when the donor-custodian is also the donee’s father with a pre-existing duty of support.</p>

As noted by the official comments to Section 11 of the Estates Act of 1947, the section preserves for the surviving spouse the right to share in the decedent’s assets “where the decedent has retained <em>important rights of ownership </em>at death.” (Emphasis added). In such cases the law treats the husband as the owner of the property during his lifetime. If, however, the husband makes an outright gift wMch divests him of any possible interest so that the property can no longer inure to his benefit, nothing in our case law or statutes would allow his widow to claim any part of this property.</p>

While Section 5(b) of the Pennsylvania Uniform Gifts to Minors Act gives discretionary power to the custodian to pay over custodial property to the minor for the minor’s “support, maintenance, education and benefit,” the act nowhere permits the custodian to use the custodial property for the custodian’s benefit. The appellee contends (supported by the dissent) that the decedent had precisely the same right oyer the property after he created the Uniform Gift fund as he had prior to the conveyance. However, under the provisions of the Act, this is clearly not the case. First, subsection (c) of Section 5 provides that <em>the court may order </em>the custodian to pay funds for the support, maintenance or education of the minor upon petition of a parent or guardian or of the minor himself if he has reached age fourteen (as in the instant case). Secondly, subsection (d) of Section 5 provides that the custodian must pay the entire unexpended fund over to the beneficiary at the time of his majority or to his estate in the event he dies a minor.</p>

As stated in Section 4 of the Pennsylvania Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, “[a] gift made in a manner prescribed in this act is irrevocable, and conveys to the minor indefeasibly vested legal title to the custodial property. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[124,774,1149,1039]]]'>However, appellee argues that this decedent-custodian would benefit from the limited power of consumption since this custodial property might relieve the decedent-father of his duty to support his son, Mare Kevin Schwartz. Of course, this argument presupposes the existence of a support obligation on the part of the custodian that can be met by payments from the custodial fund and falls apart whenever a custodian owes no duty of support to the minor. Additionally, we believe the advantage to the present decedent, if there was any advantage, was too indirect and remote and cannot be classified as a power of consumption under Section 11. It appears to be impossible for the custodian to have used his statutory authority to his own advantage; his power of consumption could <em>only </em>be exercised to benefit the minor and the existence of such power of consumption has not been demonstrated on this record to have relieved, actually or potentially, the donor-decedent of his support obligation.</p>

There is no inconsistency, however, since the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applied by the Tax Court are significantly broader than Section 11. Section 2036 of the Internal Revenue Code, Tranfers with Retained Life Estate, makes the value of any property transferred by the decedent includable in the gross estate <em>“to the extent of any interest </em>therein” (emphasis added) retained by the decedent, including “the right ... to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.” Thus, in <em>Estate of Harry Prudowshy v.

In <em>Dorothy Stuit v.

Even under the appellee’s <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>construction of Section 11 of our Estates Act, such a transfer could not be treated as a testamentary disposition since the grandmother had no duty to support the minors.</p>

However, we do not believe that the power retained by the decedent in his capacity as custodian of the gift was such an “important right of ownership” or “power of . . . consumption” to make the transfer a testamentary disposition under Section 11 of the Estates Act. The sole beneficiary of the irrevocable gift was Marc Kevin Schwartz, the decedent’s son, who enjoyed indefeasibly vested legal title to the security.

Nothing in the Act states that the custodian can use the custodial property to relieve himself of his support obligations. In order to give the custodian maximum flexibility in the administration of the fund, the Act specifically provides that he can mate distributions for the benefit of the minor “with or without regard” to his own or any other person’s duty to support the minor.

The term, <em>power of </em>consumption, should not be used even in a qualified or restricted sense to describe any of decedent’s prerogatives in relation to the custodial property under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. The decedent father, during his lifetime, might have <em>claimed </em>that the principal and income irrevocably given to his son under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act fulfilled his legal support obligations to his minor son. However, this possible <em>claim </em>is not a retention of the power to consume. If a father estab<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>lishes an irrevocable trust as to principal and income for the benefit of a single child and specifically provides in creating the trust that the purpose of the trust is to fulfill his support obligations, there is no retention of a power to consume and the trust would be insulated from attack from a surviving widow claiming her statutory election rights. To the extent, if any, that the decedent father was obligated to support his son, there existed a debtor-creditor relationship between the father and the son. In effect, Edward Schwartz <em>could have claimed </em>that use of the custodial property for support extinguished a debt created by law. He had no other possible rights and had no other freedom so far as the use of the custodial property was concerned. How can the possible use of custodial funds to extinguish a specific legal debt to the named son in the gift be considered the power to consume which will defeat an inter vivos gift when a surviving spouse always takes subject to <em>all debts </em>of the decedent. If Edward Schwartz had never made the gift to his son under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act and had died owing any payments of support for his son’s benefit, this obligation would, without question, be payable before computing the widow’s one-half share of the residuary estate. Widows, under the law, even when they elect against the will, do not take to the detriment of irrevocable inter vivos gifts to children <em>or </em>to any legal debts of the decedent.

It is the retention of these powers to pay the income or principal of the gift to the donor-custodian’s child in furtherance of the donor-custodian’s support obligation, and to conceivably consume the gift in the process, that renders the gift incomplete, and subsequently taxable to the donor-custodian upon his death.</p>
