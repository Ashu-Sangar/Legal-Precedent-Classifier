The Commonwealth Court upheld plaintiff’s standing, but sustained the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer and dismissed the complaint. <em>Valley Forge Racing Association, Inc. v.

In November, 1968, having screened a field of 15 applicants which included Valley Forge, the Commission filled its initial quota of four licenses.

The Legislature vested this authority in the Commission because of the expertise and <em>judgment </em>required in making the important decision which corporations were to be granted licenses. Thus the Commission was required to exercise an administrative <em>discretion </em>which under the circumstances was exclusively committed to it under the statutory mandate of the Legislature.” (Emphasis added). It cannot seriously be contended that the power vested in the Commission to revoke a license is any less discretionary than its original power to grant.</p>

Section 7(a) of the Horse Racing Act specifies that a license runs only for one year, after which time it must be renewed. If a disappointed applicant such as Valley Forge is dissatisfied with the Commission’s order of renewal, Ms recourse is an appeal from that decision. See <em>Man O’War </em>
