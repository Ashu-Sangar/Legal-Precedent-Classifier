Within approximately five minutes, Ethel Markham, whose niece had recently broken off an engagement to many Eobert Mamón, appellant’s son, received a telephone call inviting her to the Muller}'- home, four doors away from where she lived. Approximately twenty-five minutes later Ethel Markham went to the Mullery home, but no one answered her knock. When she returned home, Ethel reported this to her daughter, Nancy, and almost immediately Nancy went to the Mullery home.</p>

After she walked in, a voice behind her said, “Ethel, I have you now.” Then Nancy turned around and a person who appeared to be a man said, “Carol”. Nancy answered, “My name’s not Carol, my name’s Nancy”. Nancy had known Mary Mamón, as they had played games together in the Markham’s home on many occasions, and she quickly recognized this “man” to be Mary Mamón. Nancy testified that she then saw a hammer in Mary’s hand and that Mary began to chase her around the house. She chased Nancy into the upstairs, where Nancy tried to get out a window. As Mary came up the stairs, she said, “Now, Nancy, I have you.” HoAvever, Nancy managed to escape and ran doAvnstairs. During the chase, she saw Patty’s brother, Donald, in an upstairs bedroom, and his mother in a doAvnstairs bedroom lying on the floor in pools of blood. Appellant trapped Nancy in the hallway on the first floor. Nancy remembered being hit with the first blow of the hammer in the back of the head, and then she became dizzy and passed out.</p>

    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.7",309,[137,1150,1150,642]]]'>When the district attorney asked appellant, who had already been given the full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to sign the consent form, according to the testimony which he gave at the suppression hearing, the following occurred: “I repeated—I said to her, ‘Are you sure that you don’t want to call Mr. Connolly [appellant’s attorney] ? I’m not going to stop you. Certainly you have every right to call him.’ And her answer was, ‘No, I’ll skip it,’ and I said ‘It’s entirely up to you’, and she said, ‘If I didn’t sign—I’m sorry—let me see—if I didn’t sign, would you get a search warrant?’ and I said ‘We probably could.’ ”</p>

North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">391 U.S. 543</a>, <a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">88 S. Ct. 1788</a> (1968), where the court said at 550: “When a law enforcement officer claims authority to search a home under a warrant, he announces in effect that the occupant has no right to resist the search. The situation is instinct with coercion— <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>albeit colorably lawful coercion. Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.”</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[197,447,1158,854]]]'>However, in <em>Bumper, </em>the authorities claimed to have a warrant authorizing the search. Here, the testimony showed that appellant realized that she faced a decision between consenting to the search or speculating on whether the district attorney could obtain a warrant. Thus, appellant verbalized her knowledge that she was surrendering a right of which she was fully apprised. If the foregoing were all that transpired before appellant signed the consent form, there would be no doubt that her consent was valid. However, appellant also argues that, in considering whether her consent was voluntary, we must also consider the events of the entire evening, including the three-hour period during which she was in custody before she finally consented to the search. According to appellant, the totality of these circumstances constitutes “coercion” as a matter of law.</p>

At that time, appellant stated a desire to remain home with her younger son rather than accompany Robert to the police station. Shortly before 3:00 a.m., on March 24, the police returned to appellant’s home and requested that she go to the police station. Although they had no warrant for her arrest, or gave her no reason for their request, she accompanied them to headquarters. Upon her arrival, she immediately asked to see her son, but was not permitted to do so. Before any questioning began, the district attorney, who was the principal interrogator, advised appellant of her constitutional rights and told her they were invesigating a murder. At that time he did not inform appellant that she was a suspect, although later, in court, he admitted that during that <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>questioning he did consider appellant a suspect. Moreover, the district attorney neither told appellant that she was under arrest nor that she was free to go.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[132,481,1151,1410]]]'>The questioning proceeded for several hours in a room at police headquarters occupied by appellant and at least four or five police officers in addition to the district attorney. At one point during this questioning appellant apparently consented to an examination of her hair, which was performed by one of the police officers present. After a couple of hours, they asked appellant if they could clean her fingernails without advising her that any evidence so obtained could be used against her. Almost immediately after the fingernail scraping, the police asked her if they could take her fingerprints. Appellant, who by this time must have been rather curious, asked why this was necessary, and she was told it was just routine, so she consented. Later, when she returned from the fingerprinting session, the questioning resumed. It was then that she was asked for permission to search her home. Appellant thereupon asked if she could talk to her attorney; however, while the police were searching for the appropriate phone book, appellant changed her mind and decided that she did not want to see an attorney. The district attorney presented her with a consent form, which had been prepared and completed in advance. She signed the form sometime between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m., after about three hours of continuous interrogation, fingerprinting, hair searching, and fingernail scraping.</p>

The Court is presented with an affidavit containing two independent sources of information, the eyewitnesses and the victim, each of which points to appellant as the murderer, yet each of them, standing alone, arguably does not possess a sufficient guarantee of reliability to create the probable cause necessary to issue a search warrant. Given this situation, it makes no difference that neither of the sources alone would suffice for probable cause. When two <em>independent </em>informants both supply the same information about a particular crime to the police, each source tends inherently to bolster the reliability of the other. Although the information supplied by one questionable source may be insufficient, the probability is extremely small that a second independent source would supply identical information if it were not probably accurate. When faced with such a situation, the police undoubtedly have a reasonable basis for further investigation. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/379/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="379 U.S. 89" data-case-ids="11728831" data-case-paths="/us/379/0089-01">379 U.S. 89</a>, 96, <a href="/us/379/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="379 U.S. 89" data-case-ids="11728831" data-case-paths="/us/379/0089-01">85 S.

In seeking to discover this information, appellant’s counsel was motivated by fear that the jurors might have been aware that appellant had been previously tried for murder in a spectacular and widely-publicized trial. However, the questions which the defense sought to ask were very broad and the appellant’s brief admits that there was “practically no way to make the inquiry without suggesting to a juror the existence of [the prior trial for murder].” Consequently, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit the questions.
