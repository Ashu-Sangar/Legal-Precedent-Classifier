The P.U.C. in its December 21, 1970, order stated: “[T]he Commission has given considerable thought to the positive aspects of this merger. The benefits that will ultimately accrue to the subscribers of the York service area should not be given casual recognition. Analogous to many mergers, the economies that would be forthcoming in this present merger are considerable. In view of the greater bargaining position that the surviving company Generar would have in obtaining needed capital in the money markets, and other comparative advantages, such as lower administrative costs, improved labor market conditions, and more importantly, the elimination of the other two corporate companies (York and Princeton), the beneficiaries of this merger will certainly be the subscribers of York and Princeton.”</p>

Herbert, a vice-president and director of all three companies. Mi*. Herbert’s testimony was accurately and succinctly summarized by Judge Mencer speaking for the Commonwealth Court: “Mr. Herbert testified that the merger would have no adverse effect on the customers of either General, York Telephone or Princeton, but rather there would be benefits to these customers. He testified that the merger would result in a stronger company; that investors will more likely be attracted to a larger company; that <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>service will be improved; that some paper work and overlapping administrative details in connection with the three companies would be eliminated; that business relations with other businesses and governmental agencies would be simplified. Further, he testified that the merger would be helpful in regard to labor relations and would be beneficial in the administration of tariffs, employee relations, saving of executive time and in producing economies in insurance costs. His testimony could fairly be summarized as a persuasive assertion that the merger will produce operating economies and regulatory simplification that should benefit all parties.” 3 Pa.

This contention must be rejected. A careful analysis of the proceedings below indicates that the Commission did not flatly refuse to consider the effect of the merger upon rates, but merely found that complainants had produced no evidence that the merger would have any detrimental effect upon rates. In fact, the Commission’s explicit finding that the merger would result in “considerable” economies<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> can only be taken as an indication of the Commission’s belief that the merger would in fact have a beneficial effect upon rates.</p>

Along with the likely effect of a proposed merger upon the service that will be rendered to consumers, the probable general effect of the merger upon rates is certainly a relevant criteria of whether the merger will benefit the public.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[186,614,1152,267]]]'>However, in the proceedings before the Commission, complainants advanced only two arguments in support of their contention that the merger would result in higher rates.

    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[185,891,1154,652]]]'>First, complainants argued that as a result of refinancing necessitated by the merger, the surviving company would have interest costs on its debt greater than the aggregate interest costs of the constituent companies.

As a “below the line” expense, the level of interest costs will proximately affect only the owners of the utility’s equity, and not its customers.</p>

Complainants contend that after the merger the surviving company will have the right to file “system-wide” rates which would raise the cost of telephone service to consumers in the York area. We need not presently determine this issue.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[120,719,1149,598]]]'>The Commission, however, included in its order approving the merger a condition which will enable the customers formerly served by York Co. to effectively protect their rate advantages over the customers of General and Princeton. The Commission expressly required as a condition of its approval of the merger: “That General Telephone Company of Pennsylvania maintain separate operating records for the respective service areas of the former York Telephone and Telegraph Company and Princeton Telephone Company in all matters, including accounting, service, and rates.”</p>
    <p id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[121,1329,1147,208]]]'>Thus the Commission correctly rejected complainants’ argument that the merger would inevitably have the effect of raising the rates of the York area telephone users.</p>

See Section 902, 71 PS §292 and section 512, 71 PS §192. However, within their respective fields these boards and commissions are given authority to make decisions which involve not only findings of fact, but also conclusions of law. They must determine the law applicable to the facts of the cases before them. As we view it, the legislature did not intend that the attorney general should examine each case before these quasi-judicial bodies to determine how he thinks the board or commission should decide them. The legislature provided for the review of these decisions by courts to which appeals are allowed. Appeals from these decisions are not to the attorney general.</p>

The legislature directs the attorney general to represent the board or commission before the court. He cannot carry out this duty if he substitutes his own personal views of the law for the board’s decision. On the other hand, we recognize that a lawyer may have such strong convictions concerning a legal principle that he feels he can, in good conscience, argue only one position to the court.</p>

There are occasions where an attorney general is required to represent both sides of a case, as, for example, when the Highway Department appeals from a Public Utility Commission order. In such cases he cannot believe both sides to be right, and yet he is charged by statute with presenting both sides to the court. This, of course, is done through deputies or counsel assigned to the agencies involved, but inasmuch as all of these represent the attorney general himself, the attorney general is on both sides of the case.</p>

Legal disputes between departments or even between a department and a board or commission <em>involving administrative problems </em>should be, and are, settled by the opinions of the attorney general, which as to such agencies have the effect of law. An attorney general has no problem in determining his duty as to these matters. His soul-searching is induced by the problems that arise out of the decisions of the quasi-judicial boards and commissions. Here he may frequently disagree with the decisions of these boards and commissions, and yet under the law which he must administer with fidelity, he is charged with the duty of representing them in court. These boards and commissions are not in the category of ordinary lay clients, but are quasi-judicial bodies, more nearly in the category of courts, and therefore not as directly subject to the legal advice of their lawyer as are lay clients.’</p>
