Carn, guilty of Murder in the Second Degree and of Aggravated Assault and Battery on January 6, 1964. The judge imposed sentence on the murder indictment and Appel<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>lant took no appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §1, 19 P.S. 1180-1 et seq., alleging obstruction of appellate rights, and, as a result, he was allowed to file a motion for a new trial in order to perfect his appeal. He filed such a motion, alleging that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, contrary to the evidence, and contrary to the law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The motion was denied and this appeal follows.</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[133,826,1149,424]]]'>Appellant’s sole contention is that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to allow a jury to find that his actions were the cause of decedent’s death. Appellant was convicted of killing his ladyfriend, a Miss Leona Kearse. He admits that he fired a shotgun and wounded her, but claims that the Commonwealth failed to establish that these wounds caused her death.</p>

Burkhart, a member of the York Hospital pathological staff who performed the autopsy. Dr. Burkhart testified that there were two shotgun wounds, the point of entry of one being the right shoulder and the other being the <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>right buttocks. His testimony continued, “In my opinion the cause of death was due to gunshot wounds characteristic of the shotgun type associated with trauma to other organs as described, chest wall, lung, intestine, kidney, with hemorrhage, massive hemorrhage into the right chest cavity, and another factor to be considered in the cause of death has to be the factor of shock.” Finally, he testified that the specific wound causing death was the one to the right shoulder, and that the wound in the lower back or buttocks would not alone have caused death.</p>

Appellant also contends that the doctor’s testimony indicated that, had there been prompt medical attention, the gunshot wounds standing alone might not have been fatal. Under the evidence presented during this trial the jury would not have been required to reach these conclusions. Further, assuming arguendo <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>that they did accept Appellant’s theory of the facts, his position is not aided. Whether the jury found that the decedent died from the gunshot wounds themselves, or that the gunshot wounds produced the condition causing death, Appellant is legally responsible for the death. “[0]ne charged with homicide cannot escape liability merely because the blow he inflicted is not mortal, or the immediate cause of death. If his blow is the legal cause, i.e., if it started a chain of causation which led to the death, he is guilty of homicide.” <em>Commonwealth v.
