Marcijean Seymour was sixteen and one-half years old on the date of the death of Robert T. Seymour. H.

The petition accordingly proposed an allocation of $87,703.75 to the widow and $4,184 to the daughter.

It is argued that, since the Wrongful Death Act was enacted to compensate the dependent relatives of the deceased for the pecuniary losses suffered by them as a result of the death, the distribution of the recovery in equal shares among the possible beneficiaries will work injustice where the losses sustained are disproportionate. There is logical consistency to the argument that, since the wrongful death action is not intended to compensate the decedent, the proceeds of the action should not pass to the enumerated beneficiaries as though the recovery is part of the decedent’s intestate personalty, but should instead be distributed among those who have suffered pecuniary losses in proportion to the actual loss suffered by each. While this reasoning is compelling, the Legislature has chosen the intestate method <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>of distribution. Under the circumstances we cannot disturb the plain meaning of the Act in the absence of strong contravening considerations.</p>

Animal Rescue League, </em><a href="/pa/353/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="353 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="465937" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0408-01">353 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.2d%2059" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="45 A.2d 59">45 A. 2d 59</a> (1946); <em>Lewis v.

In <em>Biidekum, </em>decedent was survived by her husband and mother. As the mother sustained no provable pecuniary loss at her daughter’s death, decedent’s husband was deemed the sole person entitled to the damages recovered for her wrongful death. Similarly, in <em>Lewis, </em>the deceased was survived by his widow and adult children. Since none of the children were dependent upon decedent, this Court held that the children were not entitled to any portion of the recovery even though the Intestate Act provided for a distribution of two-thirds of the proceeds among the adult children. Finally, in <em>Lehigh Iron Compmy v. Rupp </em>the decedent was survived by his widow and parents, the parents receiving no support from the deceased and thus suffering no pecuniary loss at his death. Here again, though distribution by intestacy would have necessitated the allocation of one-half of the proceeds to the parents, this Court awarded the entire recovery to the widow.</p>

In the subject case, Marcijean Seymour did, in fact, suffer pecuniary loss by the death of her father, albeit a less substantial loss than that suffered by decedent’s surviving spouse. In the cited cases each beneficiary de<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>prived of his intestate share suffered the uniform impediment of being incapable of proving <em>any degree </em>of pecuniary loss. Where decedent is survived by two classes of relatives, one of which has suffered a pecuniary loss by reason of his death and the other of which has not, the class suffering the loss is entitled to the entire recovery to the exclusion of the class which has suffered no loss. <em>Armstrong v.

The Commonwealth possesses a large measure of discretion, however, in prescribing remedies for wrongs. It may prescribe remedies for the enforcement of rights, in the exercise of its discretion, without denying equal protection. <em>See, Scott v.

While the distribution of proceeds by the Intestate Act may render unfortunate results under some circumstances, it remains for the Legislature, not the courts, to determine <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>whether inequities in the scheme warrant legislative change. <em>See Labine v.

    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[199,428,1154,267]]]'>Appellant claims that the Wrongful Death Act’s incorporation of the Intestate Act is violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is irrelevant to the purpose for which the action for wrongful death was created.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.6",578,[193,707,1159,929]]]'>No action to recover for wrongful death existed at common law. <em>See, Pennsylvania Railroad Company v.

The Legislature’s enactment of the Wrongful Death Act conferred a new cause of action upon the statutorily enumerated heirs of the decedent. That the grant of rights was accompanied by the promulgation of a system of distribution of the funds recovered does not invalidate the Act when, in fact, the scheme is based on sound policy considerations. Incorporation of the Intestate Act into the Wrongful Death Act reduces the potential for intrafamily conflict by obviating the necessity for a jury determination respecting the apportionment of the wrongful death recovery among the beneficiaries. The procedure eases and simplifies the administration of wrongful death actions. It is thus relevant to the purpose of enactment.</p>

The Wrongful Death Act, which mandates distribution of the damages awarded in a manner other than in direct proportion to the pecuniary loss actually suffered, is just as violative of Article T, Section 11, it is argued, as a provision which would limit the plaintiff in a personal injury action to a recovery of one half his actual damages. The analogy is too tenuous because the Wrongful Death Act sets no statutory ceiling on damages. <em>Boudrou </em>is inapposite.</p>

The surviving members of the family are recompensed in damages for the deprivation. <em>But if the parents take equally with the widow the main object of the statute is in part defeated. </em>Besides, in some cases the parents would share with her, when if the deceased had not been married, they would have no right at all.

As Judge Hoffman noted in his dissenting opinion: “Allowing the minor child to share in the widow’s loss in the instant case is equally absurd. The child lives with its mother who is the deceased’s first wife and has no relation to the widow of the deceased. No interest in family harmony therefore dictates that compensation for the pecuniary loss to the widow should accrue to the child. Accordingly, the distribution ordered by the lower court violates the very clear expressions of policy and purpose in both the Lehigh and Lewis cases.” <em>Seymour v.

This is not, as the majority fears, “to <em>rewrite </em>the provision of the Wrongful Death Act which incorporates the Intestate Act”; the rewriting, if such it was, was done long ago. The legislature has not seen fit to alter the statutory language to correct the “erroneous” judgment of this court in the cases cited. This is a factor which we may now legitimately consider in deciding what meaning to give today to the language in question. See the Statutory Construction Act, May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, art.
