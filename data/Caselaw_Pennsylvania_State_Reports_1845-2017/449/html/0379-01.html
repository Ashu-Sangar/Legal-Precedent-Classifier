On the murder conviction he was sentenced by the court to life imprisonment as the jury’s verdict directed, and on the robbery convic<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>tion a sentence of 10 to 20 years imprisonment was imposed. Appeals were not then entered. However, on January 2, 1968, Alwine filed a petition seeking post-conviction relief under the Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. 1180-3, and, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded Alwine had not effectively waived his right to appeal, so an order was entered permitting the filing of post-trial motions as if timely filed. Said motions were filed, and subsequently dismissed. This appeal was then entered from the judgment of sentence imposed on the murder conviction. An appeal was not taken from the judgment entered on the robbery conviction.</p>
    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[151,1047,1149,587]]]'>It is not disputed the trial evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt of murder in the first degree, and an examination of the record readily manifests why this issue is not pressed. The record demonstrates the Commonwealth’s evidence was ample to. establish beyond a reasonable doubt that, while perpetrating a robbery of a grocery store, Alwine fatally stabbed the proprietor. That Alwine committed the crimes was not denied at trial, but the defense attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the jury he was legally insane at the time involved.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[152,1655,1148,484]]]'>The Commonwealth’s trial evidence included an incriminating statement made by Alwine during police custody. It is claimed this statement was obtained under conditions which rendered it “involuntary” and made its evidentiary use at trial violative of due process. This issue was explored and decided against Al-wine in the 1968 post-conviction proceedings and, after a careful study of the entire record, we conclude the trial court’s ruling was correct.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.6",437,[154,2153,1147,154]],["BL_438.1",438,[180,333,1154,651]]]'>The robbery and killing occurred between 8 and 9 p.m. on September 24, 1958. About 1 p.m. on the following day, Alwine was taken into police custody and <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>arrived at police headquarters about 1:30 p.m. Before any questioning began, he spontaneously said : “Do what you want with me. I done it. Nobody cares about me.” From then until late in the afternoon, he was questioned about the details of the crimes after which he made the statement now challenged. It was initially recorded in longhand by a police detective and then transposed into a typewritten statement. At one point before the statement was obtained, the questioning was interrupted for at least a half-hour during which period Alwine and his father were alone together.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[177,996,1156,816]]]'>At the time Alwine was eighteen years of age, had an I.Q. of 85, and a history of prior emotional disturbances. Additionally, he was not warned of his constitutional rights as now required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. 1602</a> (1966). On the other hand, the record is convincing he talked freely with the police from the beginning and admitted his guilt without urging or extensive questioning. Moreover, his trial testimony clearly evidences he possessed a mind fully capable of making knowing decisions. Under all the circumstances, the question of whether the statement was freely given, was for the jury. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Darden, </em><a href="/pa/441/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="441 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1933880" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0041-01">441 Pa. 41</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="271 A.2d 257">271 A. 2d 257</a> (1970); and, <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

As to this, the record discloses the following :</p>

He was immediately escorted <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>into his home by the arresting officers, and he and his father were informed of the reason for the arrest. Al-wine then asked his father for an attorney. The father replied, “definitely see how this comes out first.” Later on in the afternoon <em>after </em>the challenged statement <em>was completed and recorded, </em>Alwine refused to sign it until he consulted an attorney.</p>

In 1958, even the denial of a request to contact counsel before police questioning commenced was not an infringement of constitutional rights. Cf. <em>Crooker v.

A confession obtained under such circumstances is constitutionally defective. As this Court has previously recognized, “[t]he questions in the voluntariness area have passed beyond the physical coercion stage to the much more difficult area of psychological coercion. In this area, particularly, a close analysis of all the surrounding circumstances is necessary.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/429/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="429 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1913542" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0141-01">429 Pa, 141</a>, 149, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="239 A.2d 426">239 A. 2d 426</a>, 430 (1968) (footnote omitted).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

California, </em><a href="/us/357/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="357 U.S. 433" data-case-ids="6163569" data-case-paths="/us/357/0433-01">357 U.S. 433</a> <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>(1958). Significantly, the Supreme Court in <em>Crooker </em>found that <em>under the particular circumstances of the case in issue </em>there was no violation of due process in the state’s refusal of a request to engage counsel. It is apparent that the surrounding circumstances involved in <em>Crooker </em>are readily distinguishable from those in the instant case. In <em>Crooker </em>the petitioner was 31 years old and a college graduate who had attended the first year of law school where he had studied criminal law. In addition, he was told of his right to remain silent and when asked to take a lie detector test, he informed the operator that the results of such a test would not be admissible at trial absent a stipulation by the parties.</p>
    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[141,1097,1150,763]]]'>In contrast, the circumstances of this case reveal that appellant had a low I.Q., little formal education and was not advised of his right to remain silent. Applying the rationale of the Supreme Court in <em>Crooker, </em>which mandates a review of all the circumstances involved, the record indicates that this particular appellant’s rights were violated. Even if the incriminating statements could be deemed “voluntary”, it was prejudicially unfair to conduct a formal interrogation after refusing a request for counsel, and then to admit into evidence the resulting statement. Alwine, a person of limited mental capacity, expressly desired the protection of counsel during questioning and should not have been denied that right.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[142,1872,1150,434]]]'>In emphasizing the need for a lawyer during pretrial investigation to preserve an accused’s constitutional rights Mr. Justice Douglas stated: “The third degree flourishes only in secrecy. One who feels the need of a lawyer and asks for one is asking for some protection which the law can give him against a coerced confession. No matter what care is taken innocent people are convicted of crimes they did not commit. We</p>

The trial of the issue of coercion is seldom helpful. Law officers usually testify one way, the accused another. The citizen who has been the victim of these secret inquisitions has little chance to prove coercion. The mischief and abuse of the third degree will continue as long as an accused can be denied the right to counsel at this the most critical period of his ordeal.” 357 U.S. at 443-44 (dissenting opinion) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>
