Initial police investigation led authorities to believe that Leonard Curtis Hamilton was the principal suspect and a warrant was obtained for his arrest. Subsequently, Hamilton was found to be incarcerated in Spartansburg, South Carolina, having been charged with robbery and murder in that jurisdiction. On November 30, 1965, Sergeant Francis Brennan of the Philadelphia Police Department went to Spartansburg to interview Hamilton.

The defendant who is free on bail may find that the pending charges “disrupt his employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy and create anxiety in him, his family and friends.” <em>United States v. Marion, </em><a href="/us/404/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="404 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6172901" data-case-paths="/us/404/0307-01">404 U.S. 307</a>, 320 (1971). In addition to the general concern that all accused persons be treated according to decent and fair procedures, the Supreme Court in <em>Bather </em>noted the following societal interests in providing a speedy trial to defendants <em>free on </em>hail: “The inability of courts to provide a prompt trial has contributed to a large backlog of cases in urban <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>courts which, among other things, enables a defendant to negotiate more effectively for pleas of guilty to lesser offenses and otherwise manipulate the system. In addition, persons released on bond for lengthy periods awaiting trial have an opportunity to commit other crimes. . . . Moreover, the longer an accused is free awaiting trial, the more tempting becomes his opportunity to jump bail and escape. Finally, delay between arrest and punishment may have a detrimental effect on rehabilitation.” [Footnotes omitted.] <em>Barker v. Wingo, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. at 519-20</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.

Often, the unsophisticated, indigent defendant is without counsel until the trial, and, since the rule is not self-executing, those defendants who most need the protection it was designed to afford are often the ones denied its benefits.

On January 1, 1971 there were five thousand, three hundred and fifty-one (5,351) cases available for trial in the criminal section of the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County. During the year of 1971, eleven thousand, seven hundred and ninety (11,790) new cases were received and twelve thousand, five hundred and eighty-two (12,582) cases were disposed of leaving a total of four thousand, five hundred and fifty-<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>nine (4,559) cases available for trial as of January 1, 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> This insignificant reduction of the backlog during the reporting period of 792 cases is further depreciated by the fact that the entire gain was accomplished in the minor felony cases. While there was a reduction of one thousand, three hundred and ninety-four (1,394) cases in the minor felony category there was an increase during the same reporting period in the backlog of homicide cases of one hundred and thirty (130), bringing the total as of January 1, 1972 of untried homicide cases to four hundred and eighty-eight (488). During this period the number of untried major felonies was increased by four hundred and forty-two (442) cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The situation is further compounded because the case flow does not suggest that there is an effective effort to dispose of the earliest indictments first. An analysis of the open criminal cases during the July term 1972 indicated one thousand, one hundred and twenty-five (1,125) cases where the indictments were earlier than January 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> We have <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>not singled out Philadelphia to suggest that this is the only county in the Commonwealth with a backlog or to suggest that they have made less effort in attempting to remedy the situation.

However, in its brief, the Commonwealth states that, subsequent to the decision in this case, appellee filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Civil Bights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1983, and that this Complaint contains allegations indicating that appellee knew of the detainer prior to 1971. We have read the Complaint and find in it nothing to indicate that appellee knew of or appreciated the implications of the detainer before 1971. We therefore see no need to remand this case for a hearing to determine whether appellee’s case is weakened because he failed to demand a trial.</p>
