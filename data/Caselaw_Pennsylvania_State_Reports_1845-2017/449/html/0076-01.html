According to his confession, appellant, then 30 years of age, went to the home of his grandfather on the evening of September 2, 1955, with the avowed purpose of committing a robbery. Finding the victim at home, appellant lured him outside the house, ostensibly to look at an albino deer, and then fatally struck him over the head Avith a piece of pipe. A small amount of money and a flashlight were stolen from the house, and a watch was taken from the body of the deceased. Appellant then transported the body to and deposited it in a nearby water-filled quarry hole.</p>

The Commonwealth contended, and the trial court agreed, that in 1955, prior to the Supreme Court’s decisions in <em>Escobedo v.

The practice in this jurisdiction, however, was to advise defendants at least of their rights to remain silent and that any statements made could be used against them. These warnings were not considered to be constitution<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>ally mandated, but desirable practice and a useful precaution if the Commonwealth were successfully to rebut a subsequent challenge to the confession as involuntary. <em>Commonwealth v.

As in the above two cases, so here, no contention has been made that the confession was in fact involuntary; thus a failure of the police officer to admonish the accused before taking his statement, if this in fact occurred, would not render the statement inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Negri, supra, </em>at 30. The court did not err in not permitting the requested cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[207,1051,1157,597]]]'>(3) The third assignment of error is that the trial judge did not maintain a fair and impartial attitude in his conduct of the trial. In a trial spanning seven days and involving the testimony of over two dozen witnesses, it is only natural that a defendant should be dissatisfied with some of the court’s rulings. We have examined the trial transcript in its entirety, however, and cannot agree with appellant that the trial judge conducted the trial or exercised his discretion in a manner which was in any way hostile to appellant or prejudicial of his rights to a fair trial.</p>

When properly identified as true and correct reproductions, and when the voices are properly identified, such tape recordings are admissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Lopinson, </em><a href="/pa/427/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="427 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1910385" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0284-01">427 Pa. 284</a>, 308, <a href="/citations/?q=234%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="234 A.2d 552">234 A. 2d 552</a> (1967); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant argues, however, that the taped evidence here was merely cumulative and thus should have been excluded. Under all the circumstances of this case, we <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>do not find any abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in permitting the tape recording to be introduced.</p>
    <p id="b139-3" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[120,499,1150,1262]]]'>(5) Conviction of murder in the first degree is challenged on the ground that, aside from appellant’s confession, there was insufficient evidence to support this degree of guilt. The law is well settled that “. . . an extrajudicial admission or confession of one accused of crime cannot be received in evidence unless and until the corpus delicti of the crime has first been established by independent proof, and that failure to comply with this prerequisite will exclude the admission or confession . . . [Wjhenever . . . the Commonwealth, in a homicide case, has established that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is in fact dead and that the death occurred under circumstances indicating that it was criminally caused <em>by someone, </em>the rule is satisfied and admissions or confessions may then always be received as proof of the identity of the guilty agent; Commonwealth v.

He insists, however, that where the Commonwealth seeks to prove <em>first degree murder, </em>there also must be evidence, independent of the confession, which shows premeditation or that death occurred in perpetration of a felony. We think that this argument misconceives the underlying reason <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>for requiring proof of the corpus delicti in the first place. “The grounds on which the rule [requiring proof of the corpus delicti] rests are the hasty and unguarded character which is often attached to confessions and admissions and the consequent danger of a conviction where no crime has in fact been committed; . . <em>Turm, supra, </em>at 134. Where, as here, proof of the commission of the crime is independently established, the danger of innocent convictions is obviated and a confession is admissible to show the degree of the crime as well as the identity of its perpetrator.

Those factors are: (1) the number and nature of the prior crimes and their relationship to the murder charged; (2) whether the Commonwealth actively sought the death penalty; and (3) whether there was a substantial question of guilt to be resolved at trial. We are satisfied, reviewing the record in light of these factors, that the introduction of the burglary conviction was proper under the Parker Rule as bearing on the penalty to be imposed should the jury find appellant guilty of murder in the first degree; there was no prejudice which could be said to amount to a denial of due process. Only one prior conviction was put in evidence, and that of a crime of a different nature; it was not likely to influence the jury on the basic question of guilt. The death penalty was actively sought by the Commonwealth (appellant had in fact received it on his first trial). Finally, evidence of guilt, considering appellant’s confession, was clearly sufficient to convict without any resort to a prior criminal record.

At his first trial in 1956 appellant pleaded guilty, was adjudged guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, we affirmed.

A 1957 habeas corpus petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County resulted in reversal of this 1956 .conviction after it was determined that appellant had not been competent to stand trial. No appeal was taken from the second trial in 1958, but subsequent habeas corpus petitions were dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County in 1963; by the United States Supreme Court in 1963; by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in-1963; by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in 1964 (No. 532 Habeas Corpus) ; and by the Blair County Court of Common Pleas in 1967 (affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court at <a href="/pa/430/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="430 Pa. 659" data-case-ids="1915709,1915762" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0659-01,/pa/430/0659-02">430 Pa. 659</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20123" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="243 A.2d 123">243 A. 2d 123</a> (1968)). In 1968, appellant’s PCHA petition was denied by the Blair County Common Pleas Court, this latter order resulting in our 1970 reversal and the filing <em>mino pro tuno </em>of the motion for new trial which is the subject matter of this appeal.</p>

        <em> </em>Appellant’s record was introduced before he took the stand and put his own character into issue. Appellant admits that had the order of proof been reversed, the admissibility of the prior record could not be challenged. He contends, however, that the Commonwealth had no way of knowing what the strategy of the defense would be, and in fact forced him to broach the subject of good character.</p>

These new insights result in new applications of unchanging constitutional principles to age-old and well-known situations. The arts and sciences continually teach us more about ourselves as members of society and our relationships to each other. In deciding the justice of any man’s cause, a new awareness of constitutional injustice should not be arbitrarily ignored because of the calendar. However, because rational men may provide for finality in the appellate process, a constitutionally erroneous result occurring in that process may be insulated from collateral attack unless legislative enactments otherwise provide.
