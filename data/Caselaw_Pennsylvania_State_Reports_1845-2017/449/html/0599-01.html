Post-trial motions were denied and a sentence of not less than ten nor more than twenty years imposed. Appellant in this direct appeal argues that the Commonwealth introduced notes of testimony of a witness from an earlier proceeding<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in contravention of the Act of May 23, 1887, P.

Only after such review can it be decided whether the issues in the two proceedings were substantially the same and the opportunity to cross-examine and the adequacy of the cross-examination conducted were sufficient to justify admission of the notes of testimony. Here such review of the record demonstrates beyond question that the issues in controversy were substantially the same.</p>

The Commonwealth sought to prove at the degree of guilt hearing that appellant, after a bitter argument with the deceased bartender Carlos Rodriquez, returned to the bar and repeatedly shot Rodriquez intentionally causing his death. One of the Commonwealth witnesses, Nathaniel Willingham, testified that he saw appellant approach the bar armed with a gun, enter the bar, and start shooting.</p>

Appellant did not try to establish an alibi or contend that he was unarmed or that he did not fire any shots. Instead, appellant’s evidence at <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>trial was offered to negate the Commonwealth’s proof of first degree <em>murder—precisely the same defense relied upon at the degree of guilt hearing.</em>

    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[164,711,1155,764]]]'>The cross-examination conducted by appellant’s counsel at the degree of guilt hearing confirms the presence of opportunity and motive for adequate cross-examination and the fact that appellant’s counsel properly utilized the opportunity. During the degree of guilt hearing appellant’s counsel exploited the weakness of Willingham’s direct examination by establishing that the witness never saw appellant shoot the deceased—the witness only saw appellant firing a gun inside the bar. Appellant’s counsel by proper cross-examination challenged the accuracy of the witness’ testimony by demonstrating that the witness was outside the bar fifty feet away and had been drinking shortly before observing these events.</p>

Crosby, </em><a href="/pa/444/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="444 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1938587" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0017-01">444 Pa. 17</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2073" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="279 A.2d 73">279 A. 2d 73</a> (1971) ; and <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Clarkson, <a href="/pa/438/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="438 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1929267" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0523-01">438 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=265%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="265 A.2d 802">265 A. 2d 802</a> (1970). These cases should <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>be overruled. The <em>Clarkson </em>decision particularly illustrates the dangers of loosely interpreting the Act of 1887. In <em>Clarkson, </em>prior reported testimony at a preliminary hearing was admitted at the later trial, even though hearsay, under the Act of 1887. <em>Clarkson </em>places a burden on defense counsel to conduct a complete cross-examination at a preliminary hearing as though the actual trial of guilt or innocence was in progress. This must be done even though the preliminary hearing is held before counsel has had an opportunity to fully consult with the defendant or prepare a defense or even conduct a preliminary investigation. Such results from a loose reading of the Act of 1887 transgresses well-established evidential and constitutional safeguards for the protection of the innocent.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[203,1174,1156,377]]]'>It can be argued, of course, that the prosecution will be severely handicapped in some cases by the death of a witness or the unavailability of the witnesses for other reasons. Yet, this is always true even before any proceedings have begun. The well-established safeguards should not be dropped in later proceedings when they are so zealously defended in a first proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[204,1561,1152,148]]]'>The judgment of sentence should be reversed and in any new trial the challenged hearsay evidence should not be allowed.</p>
