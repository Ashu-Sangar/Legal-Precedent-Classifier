I just killed two people.” That assertion was soon verified by the discovery of the bodies of Linda Fisher and Richard Bitting in a station wagon parked behind a nearby lounge. During the course of the morning at the police station, appellant was warned of his constitutional rights on several occasions, twice in writing; he nevertheless gave a written statement of the events surrounding the crimes. He further informed police that the murder weapon was an 8mm. rifle lying on the back seat of his car, then parked outside the station. Accompanied by appellant’s father and brother, a police officer retrieved the weapon and unexploded ammunition.</p>

At Barney’s Cafe, Hollenbaugh encountered Linda Fisher in the company of Richard Bitting, a man the appellant had a short time previously threatened with death should he persist in his attentions toward Linda Fisher. It appears that <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>the appellant Hollenbaugh was at that precise moment midway between girl friends: he had been carrying on an illicit relationship with Linda Fisher and had heard through rumor that she was with child, and he had only recently entered into a similar relationship with Linda Motter, his companion of the evening. After Barney’s Cafe closed for the evening, Hollenbaugh and Linda Motter drove to her parents’ home and there passed the hours before daylight in his parked car. After taking leave of Miss Motter, appellant drove back to Barney’s to ascertain if his other paramour, Linda Fisher, was displaying the fidelity of which he himself was apparently incapable. She was not.</p>

      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>Prior to trial appellant’s attorney filed a motion to suppress the confession and the rifle and ammunition in the hands of the prosecutor on the ground that the confession was obtained in violation of appellant’s rights against self-incrimination under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/citations/?q=384%20U.S.%20426" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="384 U.S. 426">384 U.S. 426</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="16 L.

Ed. 2d 694</a> (1966), and that the evidence was seized from appellant’s car without a warrant and not incident to an arrest. At the hearing on the motion, it appeared that appellant had been repeatedly warned of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, both orally and in writing, and that after informing the police of the location of the murder weapon, appellant had affirmatively indicated that he consented to a search of his car. The suppression court denied the motion. Subsequently, appellant’s counsel recommended to his client that a guilty plea was the best course of action.</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[131,1223,1152,1150]],["BL_70.1",70,[197,328,1156,422]]]'>In the face of evidence as damning as that in the case at bar, it cannot be said to be unreasonable for counsel to advise his client to plead guilty. Appellant’s attorney had done what he could to suppress the confession and the gun; the court’s resolution of the factual issues against appellant—that he had been warned and that he had consented to the search—was not clearly erroneous. In light of the prospective use of this evidence at trial, counsel’s recommendation to plead guilty rather than stand trial was surely a reasonable choice among the available alternatives. While there was, to be sure, a risk that the court would find first degree murder at the degree of guilt hearing, it appeared certain that if the defendant went to trial before a jury, a conviction of voluntary manslaughter would be the least possible verdict; acquittal was out of the question, and the death penalty was a distinct possibility. Since voluntary manslaughter could also be sought before the court in a degree of guilt hearing following a plea of guilty to murder generally, it was sound strategy to attempt to eliminate the risk of a <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>death penalty while at the same time preserving the possibility of obtaining a conviction of the least serious offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We have no hesitance in concluding that appellant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth v.

A review of the colloquy between the trial court and appellant indicates that appellant’s plea of guilty to murder generally rested to a “significant degree” on a plea bargain in which the district attorney promised to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, gee <em>Santobello v. New </em>York, <a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">404 U.S. 257</a>, 262, <a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">92 S. Ct. 495</a>, 499 (1971). Notwithstanding this plea bargain neither the district attorney nor defense counsel informed the trial court of the agreement, and both counsel stood mute during the degree of guilt hearing. If this was so, the failure by both the district attorney and defense counsel to inform the court of the existence of the plea bargain was in clear violation of their respective professional obligations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

See e.g., <em>Santobello v. New York, </em><a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">404 U.S. 257</a>, <a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">92 S.

Culbreath v. Rundle, </em>F. 2d (3d Cir. 1972). Here, however, appellant did in fact receive a sentence of life imprisonment despite the failure of either the district attorney or defense counsel to inform the court of the plea bargain. My concurrence in no way condones the district attorney’s or defense counsel’s failure to satisfy their professional responsibilities by informing the court of the existence of the plea bargain.</p>
