For example, a corporation that owns a large apartment building often provides to its tenants, in addition to the actual physical premises, services such as trash removal, security guards, gardening, etc. However, common sense indicates that in such a landlord-tenant arrangement the receipts from the tenants would represent primarily a return on the physical structure owned rather than compensation for services rendered as a part of the tenancy arrangement.</p>

The majority correctly perceives that the issue is solely that of interpreting the word <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>“rentals” as used in this phrase. There is no dispute as to the operative facts—the manner in which the appellant corporation uses its Pennsylvania situated billboards, or “bulletins,” in its business—and hence the majority’s citation to cases which deal with the placement of the burden of proof as regards operative facts is inapposite.</p>

It is admitted in the Court’s opinion that interpretation of the word “rentals” is not easy, and that, as viewed by the majority, the line must be drawn at some ill-defined point lying somewhere between income received for rendition of personal services and income received from the “rental” of property. Having admitted that there is considerable uncertainty in the reach of this legislatively chosen word, I cannot understand how the issue can then be resolved against the taxpayer.

See Webster’s Third International Dictionary; Black’s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968); 48 Am. Jur. 2d, Landlord &amp; Tenant, §514. It is a stipulated fact in the present case that appellant’s advertisers have no right of <em>possession </em>of the bulletins or sign boards; the sole <em>use </em>of the signs is the placement of advertisements upon them, but this is done by appellant. The majority’s construction of the word “rentals” as denoting income earned primarily by virtue of the ownership of tangible property and secondarily through the rendition of personal services may not be out of place in a textbook on economics; it is, however, a far cry from the “common and approved” usage the legislature must be held to have intended.</p>
