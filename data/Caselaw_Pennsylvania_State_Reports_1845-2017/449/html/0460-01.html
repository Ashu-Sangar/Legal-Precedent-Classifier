      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>The facts are not in dispute: Appellant was employed for approximately five years as a bookkeeper and clerical assistant for the Joseph Wedner and Son Co. On June 27, 1969, this corporation was involuntarily placed into receivership. Thereafter, appellant, as well as other employees of Joseph Wedner and Son, was transferred to the employ of the Golden Triangle Storage Co., Inc. (Golden Triangle), an affiliated corporation. In August of 1969, this company also suffered a financial setback and was forced to cease operation. Appellant, in the latter part of August, filed the instant claim for unemployment benefits.</p>

The record further discloses that appellant played no part in the decisions which led to the insolvency of either corporation. In addition to receiving a salary for services rendered, Mrs. Wedner, serving as a corporate secretary, also was awarded, in 1968, two percent of the stock in both corporations as remuneration for keeping the corporate minute books. Ninety-six percent of the outstanding shares were owned by appellant’s husband, who served as President of both corporations. The remaining two percent of the stock was held by appellant’s brother-in-law. Thus, both businesses were family owned corporations.</p>

    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[189,436,1157,537]]]'>“(10) The amount of any payment made after October first, 1961, to an individual by any corporation, partnership, association or other business entity in which fifty per centum (50%), or more of the proprietary interest is owned by such individual, his spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, or any combination of such persons, <em>unless the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.O.A. §§3301 et </em>seq.] <em>is payable with respect to such payment or payments.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[189,985,1156,809]]]'>Under Section 404 of the Law, an applicant such as appellant must have been paid a certain minimum ($440) in <em>“wages” </em>in the base year in order to qualify for benefits. As appellant’s husband owned 98% of the proprietary interest in the employing corporation, Golden Triangle Storage Co., Inc., it is clear that under Section (4) (x) (10) her remuneration from that corporation did not qualify as “wages”, unless a tax was payable by that company under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Because the record does not reveal whether or not such a federal tax was in fact payable, I would remand to the Board for such a determination. Since the remand ordered by the majority appears to be premised on the appellant’s eligibility for benefits, I am obliged to dissent.</p>
