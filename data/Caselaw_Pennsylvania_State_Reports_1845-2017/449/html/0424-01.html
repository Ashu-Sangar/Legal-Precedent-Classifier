The meeting between the defendant and Bigi began in a friendly manner, but concluded in Bigi’s giving defendant the required Miranda (Miranda v.

However, in this petition Slavik urged a <em>new theory </em>to support his previously presented and litigated claim that his plea was constitutionally infirm.

First his claim has been finally litigated; and secondly, <em>Roundtree </em>does not apply because Slavik did not present any exculpatory facts at the time he entered his plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

That issue, so determined, reached the procedural and substantive end-of-the-line of the state’s judicial process. Thereafter that same issue could not be subsequently reintroduced for judicial decision and again begin a tour of the state’s judicial system. Indeed, Pennsylvania has a significant and compelling jurisprudential interest in preventing the useless burdening of its judicial machinery with repetitive consideration of issues previously decided. It is evident that the orderly administration of justice requires that a criminal controversy, like any other litigation, some day come to an end. Therefore, since the determination of the guilty plea’s validity was a final decision on the merits of that issue within Section 4 of the PCHA, that issue may not be relitigated in a PCHA proceeding simply because another theory or argument is advanced.</p>

It was not until the following day, after a three-judge court was empanelled at the degree of guilt hearing that Slavik presented any facts tending to establish an affirmative defense to the charge of murder, or to rebut the Commonwealth’s attempt to elevate the offense to murder in the first degree, or in mitigation of the offense.

There we stated: “It is axiomatic that for a plea of guilt to be constitutionally valid, it must be the voluntary and intelligent act of the maker. In short, it cannot be the product of ignorance, i.e., the accused must know what he is doing and be fully aware of the consequences of his act. And where the accused at the time of arraignment does not know, or asserts that he does not know, whether he has committed the crime, a plea of guilty to that crime should be accepted with great caution. However, such a situation, as the one just described, is not to be equated with a situation <em>where the accused admits his guilt in one breath, but in the newt proclaims his innocence. </em>The latter clearly would not be a sufficient plea upon which to enter a judgment. But where there is significant evidence of guilt as there was in the present case, and the accused, after adequate consultation with his counsel, decides to plead guilty, that plea is not rendered invalid merely because the accused is unable or unwilling to detail the occurrence in court.” Id. at 178-79, 249 A. 2d at 295 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>

There appellant attempted to avoid the waiver rule by presenting on collateral attack a different argument. We stated: “The fact that appellant’s conflict of interest claim arises from an allegedly novel factual situation does not bring this ease under the <em>Cheeks </em>rule which precludes a waiver in instances of newly announced principles of law. All of the facts and legal precedents necessary to construct and argue this claim were as available at the time of appellant’s direct appeal as they are now. So long as counsel in her prior appeal was constitutionally effective, the fact that her present counsel may perhaps be more imaginative in constructing allegations of trial error is of no moment. To excuse an otherwise effective waiver of a claim on the sole ground that the claim arises from a novel factual setting is contrary to the significant policies of finality clearly embedded in Sections 3 and 4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act . . . .” Id. at 219, 285 A. 2d at 863.</p>
