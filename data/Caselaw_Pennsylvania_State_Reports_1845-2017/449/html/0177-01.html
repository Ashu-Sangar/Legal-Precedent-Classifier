DiEmilio was arrested on March 20, 1970, and subsequently charged with the murder of his wife. Appellant’s trial was delayed over a year while a determination was made as to his mental capacity to stand trial. The trial before a jury commenced on October 26, 1971. At the outset of the trial three psychiatrists, representing appellant, the district attorney, and the institution in which appellant was hospitalized after his arrest, unanimously testified that appellant was legally insane at the time of the crime in question as determined by the M’Naghten test.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>hearing this testimony the trial court directed the jury to find appellant not guilty by reason of insanity.

Shovlin, Superintendent of Farview State Hospital, recommended to the trial court that appellant be transferred to Haverford State Hospital. The basis of this recommendation was Dr. Shovlin’s considered professional judgment that appellant’s illness did not require maximum security, and appellant’s treatment would be facilitated by transfer to another institution. The transfer request was denied by the trial court and appellant thereupon instituted the present writ of habeas corpus, seeking transfer to another hospital pursuant to Dr. Shovlin’s recommendation. After dismissal by the court of his writ of habeas corpus, appellant appealed to this Court. Because we find that the court, in denying the transfer request, erroneously relied upon repealed statutory provisions, we reverse and remand.</p>

    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.10",239,[123,1468,1150,763]]]'>Since the Court in 1971 committed the appellant, Mr. DiEmilio, and considered his transfer request under the terms of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, §66, as <em>amended, </em>19 P.S. §1351, and not under the terms of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of October 20, 1966, Spec. Sess. No. 3, P. L. 96, art. I, §101 <em>et seq., </em>50 P.S. §4101 et seq., the question should have been whether both the commitment and refusal of transfer were improper because Section 1351 of the Act of 1860 was repealed by Section 701(b) of the Act of 1966, as inconsistent with the later Act. Both Acts provide for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity. The inconsistency concerns the role of the court in the commitment and transfer process.</p>

The opinion, however, seems to be concerned with both commitments of individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity and transfer of those individuals once committed. Therefore, the majority opinion is somewhat unclear as to whether both Section 1351 commitments and transfers are invalid. Assuming Section 1351 is invalid, the majority opinion fails to discuss Section 406 commitments under the Act of 1966, of those individuals acquitted by reason of insanity. Briefs were filed by the appellant, the District Attorney of Delaware County and the State Attorney General. All three briefs discuss both the commitment and transfer of Mr. DiEmilio.</p>

    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[187,1211,1159,1150]],["BL_241.1",241,[128,339,1149,148]]]'>Section 1351 of the Act of 1860 states that after an individual has been acquitted because of insanity the court has the power to keep an individual in “strict custody, in such place and in such manner as to the said court shall seem fit.” Section 413 of the Act of 1966 states: “Whenever any person charged with any crime is acquitted on the ground of insanity... the court may direct the Attorney for the Commonwealth to act as petitioner to initiate commitment proceedings under section 406.” Section 406 outlines the procedure to be followed before an individual can be committed, whereas Section 1351 gives the court the power to commit someone but does not require specific procedures, as outlined in Section 406, <em>i.e., </em>petition, hearing, examination and order of commitment. The plain meaning of Section 413 of the Act of 1966 is that after acquittal by reason of insanity the court may or may not direct the Attorney for the Commonwealth to initiate commitment proceedings, but if it so directs the Attorney, it must be to initiate a commitment proceeding under Section 406. As to commitments, Section 1351 of the <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>Act of 1860 is repealed by the Act of 1966 and, therefore, Mr. DiEmilio should be recommitted under Section 406 of the Act of 1966.</p>
    <p id="b241-3" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[129,505,1149,820]]]'>Section 406, however, is a general commitment statute and fails to provide specifically for commitment of individuals previously found not guilty by reason of insanity. That is, it fails to recognize the possible dangerous tendencies of such individuals. Section 1351 provided that individuals acquitted by reason of insanity would be kept in “strict custody.” Admittedly, not all such individuals would require such detention. But it is erroneous to say that all such individuals would not require such detention. Therefore, even though the Act of 1966 supersedes the Act of 1860, Section 406 must be read with this in mind and the committing court must still be able to commit an individual acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity to a maximum security institution.</p>

The Equal Protection Clause is not violated where reasonable classifications exist to justify separate treatment. To apply Section 406 to ordinary civil commitments and those civil commitments resulting from the individual’s acquittal because of insanity affords both the same procedural safeguards. That those acquitted of a crime because of insanity may be more readily sent to maximum security institutions is the only possible difference in the application of Section 406 to either case. <em>Baxstrom v. Herold, </em><a href="/us/383/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="383 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6168264" data-case-paths="/us/383/0107-01">383 U.S. 107</a> (1966), would not prohibit such a difference. The petitioner in <em>Baxstrom </em>was committed at the end of his penal sentence without a judicial determination that he was dangerously mentally ill. He was committed under a statutory procedure by which a person could be civilly committed at the end of his penal sentence without the review available to <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>all. others civilly committed. Applying Section 406 to the instant case, appellant was afforded a judicial determination on his mental state and by standards identical to those committed who are noncriminal mentally disturbed. The Court in <em>Bawstrom </em>said: “Classification of mentally ill persons as either insane or dangerously insane of course may be a reasonable distinction for purposes of determining the type of custodial or medical care to be given. . . .” <a href="/us/383/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="383 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6168264" data-case-paths="/us/383/0107-01">383 U.S. at 111</a>.</p>

    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[173,993,1157,1084]]]'>Section 1351 of the Act of 1860 further states that the court shall have the power to order that the individual remain in “strict custody ... so long as such person shall continue to be of unsound mind.” If committed under the Act of 1966, according to Section 416 the individual may be transferred from one facility to another without court approval. (The Legislature in the Act of 1966 specifically provided for court approval in certain transfer situations, <em>i.e., </em>§416 (d).) As to transfers between facilities, Section 1351 of the Act of 1860 is also inconsistent with the Act of 1966 and thus repealed. Therefore, Mr. DiEmilio could be transferred according to Section 416 of the Act of 1966 without court approval “upon application by the director of any state operated facility” to the Department of Public Welfare. However, since I would direct the lower court to recommit Mr. DiEmilio under Section 406 of the Act of 1966 his transfer request should be postponed until it is determined where he will be recommitted.</p>

    <p id="b243-3" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[141,527,1148,431]]]'>It is interesting to note that the lower court judge refused to grant habeas corpus for the transfer of Mr. DiEmilio because he was to be transferred to Haverford Hospital Haverford had taken Mr. DiEmilio on a voluntary commitment in January 1970 and released him in February 1970, with the same diagnosis presently given to justify his transfer from a maximum security institution. In March of 1970 he killed his wife.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[141,971,1148,708]]]'>The majority opinion also states that the Act of 1966 is concerned with affording the individual committed procedural safeguards. What procedural safeguards are available if the court’s role is terminated in this type of transfer case and all discretion is left with the medical personnel? Suppose the situation were reversed : Mr. DiEmilio being acquitted because of insanity for a lesser offense and committed under the Act of 1966 to a standard State mental facility such as Haverford. Would this Court uphold his transfer to a maximum security institution on the recommendation of the director of the standard State mental facility without court approval?</p>
