Mrs. Eobinson, conscious at the time, gave the police a description of her assailant. Minutes later the same officers noticed appellant walking approximately five blocks from the scene. The police arrested appellant and a search of the bag he was carrying revealed a handgun containing one spent round and five live rounds, a box of cartridges, a pinch bar and a screwdriver. At police headquarters, appellant was questioned and gave a confession in which he admitted he had broken into the house but contended <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>the shooting was accidental.

Appellant contends the phrase “in the street” is a well-known expression indicating time spent out of prison and, consequently, to admit the phrase absent cautioning instructions permitted the jury to surmise that appellant had committed other crimes. We do not agree. We have serious doubts whether any of the jurors were aware of the meaning appellant would have us place on these three words. Appellant admits the phrase is commonly used by habitual offenders. With the phrase enjoying such limited exposure, the court below was correct in refusing to insert cautionary instructions. As the court below points out, to single out this isolated phrase for special instructions “would only serve to confuse the jury and perhaps lend meaning not necessarily inherent in the phraseology used.”</p>

Following the hearing, the court permitted the record to be amended to read “into the affair.”</p>

      <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>For the following reasons, which in no way impugn the integrity of the court stenographer, it is our opinion the court below was correct in allowing the correction: 1. The alleged comment followed the trial judge’s reference to the effect of appellant’s admission that he had broken into the deceased’s apartment, found her sleeping, she woke up and became hysterical and, during a struggle, the gun accidentally discharged. In the context of the entire statement, the word “chair” makes no sense whatsoever. 2. In the paragraph immediately preceding the alleged comment, the trial judge twice used the word “affair” when referring to the incident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ****8 3. It is admitted that neither counsel for appellant nor the District Attorney heard the word “chair” mentioned by the court. 4. The trial judge denies ever using the word “chair,” contending the word was “affair.” 5. No exception, aside from a general exception to the charge, was taken. We point this out, not so as to preclude appellant from advancing this allegation of error, but to add to the cumulative evidence that the word “chair” was not mentioned by the trial judge.</p>

Other police arrived, and the two officers, Lowery and McGee, left the house to cruise the area. As they turned a corner one block from the victim’s home, they noticed a man walking about four blocks away. The officers testified there were no other pedestrians about. As they approached, the officers noticed the man was wearing a brown coat and a grayish hat and carrying a blue overnight bag. The appellant had turned up a walkway leading to a dwelling house when the officers parked their patrol car and Officer Lowery called to the appellant to come down the steps. The officers left their vehicle and met appellant halfway down the steps, at which time they noticed he was perspiring heavily and had what the officers thought was a spot of blood on his face. The officers frisked the appellant and found nothing; they then made inquiry as to the contents of the bag. When the appellant did not answer, one of the officers requested the bag, to which appellant replied, “I won’t give you the bag. I’ll show you what’s in the bag.” At this point the officers grabbed the bag, a scuffle ensued, the appellant was restrained and visible in the partially unzipped bag was the handle of a revolver.</p>

Detective Hoffman further testified that appellant acknowledged his understanding of his rights. Following this, an intelligence summary was taken, at the conclusion of which appellant was left alone for about thirty minutes. At about 5:00 p.m., he requested permission to speak with his wife. Following the phone conversation, the appellant ate dinner and was questioned at approximately 5:30 p.m., after again being informed of his rights.
