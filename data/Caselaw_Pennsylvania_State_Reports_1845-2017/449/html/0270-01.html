Appellant took no direct appeal from this judgment of sentence, although he was advised of his right to appeal by the sentencing judge. On July <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>27,1971, appellant filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in which he requested a new trial or a reduction of sentence. Following a hearing, with counsel, all requested relief was denied, and appellant appealed.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[189,616,1154,322]]]'>Here appellant raises three issues: (1) the Commonwealth’s witnesses perjured themselves at the degree of guilt hearing, thus making appellant’s sentence “harsher than it [otherwise] would have been;” (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (3) he “was unlawfully induced to enter his plea” of guilty.</p>

Appellant does <em>not </em>claim that the perjured testimony prejudiced the verdict. In fact such a contention would be completely frivolous since appellant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Appellant, however, does argue that the alleged perjury resulted in a more severe sentence than he would otherwise have received. At first glance the logical nexus between the claimed perjury and the length of sentence is somewhat obscure. What appellant appears to be arguing is that if, in fact, decedent was armed at the time of the shooting, then there could be sufficient mitigating circumstances to persuade a judge to impose a lesser sentence. However, at the post-conviction hearing appellant could not produce sufficient evidence to sustain his claim of perjury. The only testimony appellant adduced at the hearing was (1) his personal assertion that decedent’s wife committed perjury; (2) the testimony of one witness, not present at the time of the shooting, that two hours prior to the shooting decedent was carrying a gun; and (3) the testimony <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>of another witness that at the time of the shooting he observed a person, whom he could <em>not </em>identify, on decedent’s property carrying a gun.</p>
    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[151,511,1147,767]]]'>The issue presented by this evidence is one of credibility, and the hearing judge resolved the issue against appellant. Moreover, the court could have properly concluded that the other testimony, even if believed, was insufficient to sustain the perjury claim. The hearing court has authority to believe all, part of, or none of a witness’ testimony. <em>Commonwealth, v.

In point of fact, at the PCHA hearing Heirendt admitted he could not with certainty identify the person who held the gun at the time of the shooting. It would certainly have been reasonable for defense counsel to believe that such equivocating testimony would not lend support to his client’s version of the shooting. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Because as a matter of trial strategy defense counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>for his decision not to call the witness, his assistance was not constitutionally ineffective.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[180,615,1156,654]]]'>Appellant’s final contention is that his guilty plea was unlawfully induced and thus was not voluntary. Appellant claims he believed he was pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter and not to murder generally. However, since appellant was found guilty only of voluntary manslaughter, this claim lacks merit. Additionally, he asserts his counsel misled him as to the amount of time he would actually serve if he pleaded guilty. Appellant claims he was told he would serve only three years of a four to eight year sentence, and that he would not have pleaded guilty had he thought he would serve a four year term.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ****8</p>

The only testimony appellant offered was Ms personal allegation and the admission of his trial counsel, on cross-examination, that possibly appellant could have been misled as to the portion of the sentence he would actually serve, but he was definitely not misled as to what the minimum sentence would be.
