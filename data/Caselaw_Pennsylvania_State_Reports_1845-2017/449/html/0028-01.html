During the presentation of her case, the defendant called a character witness who testified that La Dainty Little had an excellent reputation in her neighborhood for being a truthful, honest person. The first question presented is whether it was error for the district attorney to cross-examine this witness concerning a prior unrelated arrest of appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The second <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>question is whether the trial court erred in referring to this prior arrest in its charge to the jury without indicating the purpose for which the question was asked, viz., impeachment of the witness, and instructing the jury that it had no probative value as to merits of the case being tried.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

See 3A Wigmore on Evidence, §980a (Rev. Third Ed., 1970); American Law Institute, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 306 (1942). Wigmore has adequately summarized the purpose of this rule: “. . . a mere arrest or indictment will not be allowed to be inquired after, since the fact of arrest or indictment is quite consistent with innocence, and since the reception of such evidence is merely the reception of somebody’s hearsay assertion as to . . . <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>guilt. To admit this would involve a violation both of the hearsay rule and of the rule forbidding extrinsic testimony of misconduct.” 3A Wigmore on Evidence, §980a (Rev. Third Ed., 1970). When, however, the defendant introduces evidence of his own good character, as was done in the instant case, the Commonwealth is permitted to cross-examine the character witnesses “as to whether or not they ever heard <em>persons in the neighborhood </em>attribute particular offenses to the defendant.” <em>Commonwealth v.
