Appellants urge that we reevaluate our case law, change our rule and hold that, in the absence of <em>any </em>testamentary language demonstrating the intent of the testator, it should be <em>presumed </em>that the testator intended to include adopted children. The legislative guide line of construction enunciated in Section 16(b) of the 1917 Wills Act, <em>supra, </em>is applicable “unless a contrary intention appears” in the will. Section 16(b) refers solely to adoptions by a person or persons other than the testator, <em>i.e., </em>known as the “stranger-to-the-adoption” situation. Obviously, the legislative purpose was to thwart adoptions undertaken by a person or persons other than the testator for the purpose of preventing a gift over in default of children. We repeat, <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>in passing upon the statutory language, our courts adopted a rule of construction (engrafted on the statutory language) that, in the absence of <em>any </em>demonstration of the actual intent of the testator, a <em>presumption </em>arises that the testator intended to <em>include </em>in the words “child” or “children” only natural children and to <em>exclude </em>adopted children.</p>

In such re-examination, initially, we give recognition to the so-called “stranger” status of appellants. Appellants are “strangers” to the blood <em>(i.e., </em>there are no biological ties) of either the testator or his son and are also “strangers” to any adoption by the testator <em>(i.e., </em>they were adopted by a person other than the testator). Moreover, it is obvious that appellants’ adoptions were not known to testator and the record does not reveal whether Adolph Tafel, the son, could have had natural children or, if not, whether the testator was aware of such fact, nor is there any evidence whether any of testator’s other children had adopted a child or children of which fact testator was aware. <em>Cf., Chambers Estate, </em><a href="/pa/438/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="438 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1929235" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0022-01">438 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20746" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="263 A.2d 746">263 A. 2d 746</a> (1970).

The common law did not recognize adoption; prior to 1855 we had no general statute in Pennsylvania providing for an adoption procedure. <em>See, Thompson’s Adoption, </em><a href="/pa/290/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="290 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1104480" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0586-01">290 Pa. 586</a>, 590, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20737" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="139 A. 737">139 Atl. 737</a>, 739 (1927) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>At the outset, we inquire what the legislative body, in the statutes providing for adoptions, has provided as to the rights of adopted children vis-a-vis natural children. Beginning with the first adoption statute of 1855, on <em>eight </em>occasions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> whenever the legislature has spoken on the effect of an adoption once decreed, the legislature has expressly, specifically and unequivocally mandated that the adopted person “shall have <em>all </em>the rights of a child and heir of” the adoptive parents. As we said in <em>Collins Estate, </em><a href="/pa/393/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="393 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1279727" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0195-01">393 Pa. 195</a>, 201, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.2d%20178" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="142 A.2d 178">142 A. 2d 178</a>, 182 (1958): “This Act of 1855 has a four-fold significance : its declaration that an adopted child was the ‘heir’ of its adopting parents, its recognition of the existence of reciprocal rights of inheritance between an adopted child and its adoptive brothers and sisters, its omission to grant reciprocal rights of inheritance to the adopting parents and its recognition that estates of intestates might descend to and be distributed among persons not of the blood of the intestate. [Footnote omitted.]” Despite the language of the adoption statutes, our courts have given but “lip service” to the legislative mandate in the construction of wills and trusts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>In only two areas have our courts followed the legislative mandate.. In <em>Cave’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/326/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="326 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1174451" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0358-01">326 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20460" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="192 A. 460">192 Atl. 460</a> (1937), we held that, in cases of <em>actual intestacy, </em>an adopted child can inherit not only from his adoptive parents but also from the collateral relatives of the adoptive parents. Our later case law has not altered this ruling so that, as the law now stands, in <em>actual intestacy </em>an adopted child is given all the rights of inheritance of a natural child, in <em>Collins Estate, supra, </em>we construed a gift to “descendants” of a life tenant in the 1912 will of a decedent who died in 1921 to include children who were adopted by the life tenant many years after the decedent’s death. The ruling in <em>Collins </em>was restricted to an inclusion of adopted children in the word “descendants”. In all other instances involving testamentary gifts to a “child” or “children” of a person other than the testator-settlor, we have held that adopted children, adopted after the will was executed (under the Wills Act of 1917, supra) or after the death of the testator (under the Wills Act of 1947), were not entitled to take as “children”. The rationale of this case law was based solely upon a reliance on the “cut-off date” of the adoptions set forth in both Wills and Estates Acts and by indulging in a presumption employed in the interpretation of the. phrase “unless a contrary intention appears” that the testator intended to exclude adopted children. <em>Cf., Chambers Estate, </em><a href="/pa/438/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="438 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1929235" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0022-01">438 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20746" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="263 A.2d 746">263 A. 2d 746</a> (1970).

I disagree. In my view, there is no sound basis for concluding that the settlor, by employing those terms, intended to exclude adopted children from sharing in his bounty. It is far more likely, and more reasonable to assume, that the absence of an express direction with respect to the matter indicates that the settlor failed to advert to the possibility of adopted children, their inclusion or exclusion, and, accordingly, expressed no explicit direction one way or the other. Had he adverted to the question, and determined not to include adopted children as beneficiaries of the trust estate, it is reasonable to assume that he would not have restricted himself to the cryptic designations upon which the majority relies, but would have employed language which would have left no doubt as to his intent.</p>

Thus, the sound approach, as I view the matter, would be to adopt a rule of construction which, <em>in the absence of a clear expression in the instrument of the settlor’s intention to the contrary, </em>would deem adoptees as embraced within such general designations as ‘issue’ or ‘children’.
