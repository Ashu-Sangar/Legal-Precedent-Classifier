    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.7",293,[153,824,1150,490]]]'>“Before Wilson could rejoin his friends, who had taken seats at the far end of the bar, he was invited by the deceased, Lawrence Wyatt, to have a drink with him. Wyatt then ordered two drinks, one for himself and one for Wilson. However, Wilson decided to consume both drinks himself. This precipitated an argument over who was going to pay for the beverages. This argument escalated into a physical fight with Wyatt striking Wilson and Wilson throwing a chair at Wyatt.</p>
    <p id="b293-7" data-blocks='[["BL_293.8",293,[150,1325,1150,324]]]'>“'At that point, one of the [appellant’s] friends, Bruce Reese, ran over to join in the fray. Reese was soon followed by the [appellant’s] other friend, Eldridge Johnson. The fight had reached a point where Reese, Johnson and the [appellant] Wilson all were beating Wyatt on the barroom floor.</p>

He grabbed the [appellant] Wilson and pinned him against the bar. But while Wilson was pinned against the bar, Eldridge Johnson stabbed Lawrence Wyatt with a knife and inflicted the wounds which caused the latter’s death. There was no evidence that Norwood Wilson himself had any weapon.” (Findings of Fact from pp. 1-2 of the Lower Court’s Opinion dated June 16, 1971).</p>

All theories that are recognized under our law to hold one responsible for the criminal acts of another require the existence of a shared criminal intent. It is well settled that the nexus which renders all members of a criminal conspiracy responsible for the acts of any of its members is the unlawful agreement. <em>Commonwealth v.

There is no indication that, prior to entering the bar, the three men formed an intent to engage in an altercation either with the decedent or anyone. To the contrary, this fight was spontaneous and partly precipitated by the decedent. All witnesses agree that the appellant did not sit with his friends from the time he entered the bar until the time they entered the fight. There was no testimony to suggest that he in any way invited or encouraged his friends to join in the struggle after it had begun. More importantly, there is no evidence that he encouraged, acquiesced in, or was even aware of the use of the knife. This court has held that a defendant who had</p>

Similarly, where a third party decides on his own initiative to become a participant in an affray between two others and without any request or encouragement, he alters radically the nature and course of the encounter, there can be no nexus of common intent to fasten vicarious criminal liability for the third party’s acts on the initial participants.</p>
