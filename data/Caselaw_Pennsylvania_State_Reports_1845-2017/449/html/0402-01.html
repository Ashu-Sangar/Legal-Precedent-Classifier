The construction requires street crossings over the subway line at fifteen separate locations. Appellees, the City of Philadelphia (City) and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), filed an application with the Public Utility Commission (Commission) pursuant to the Public Utility Law of 1937, Act of May 28, 1937, P.

SEPTA will operate the subway extension on its completion. The City has agreed to relocate all City-owned water mains, drainage facilities and transit ducts and to defray as much of the cost of relocation of the facilities of the Philadelphia Gas Works as the City assumed by agreement with the Gas Works dated December 29, 1961. All of these expenses will be defrayed from the proceeds of the City bond issue.</p>

There is no agreement lacking here.

Public Service Commission, </em><a href="/pa-super/127/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="127 Pa. Super. 544" data-case-ids="999744" data-case-paths="/pa-super/127/0544-01">127 Pa.

Appellants would define “paid” in the context of Section 411(a) as pertaining only to payments pursuant to final allocation of costs by the Commission. This interpretation renders the proviso “mutually <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>agreed upon and paid” meaningless. According to this view, the Commission can always allocate costs as it sees fit, where the parties have agreed upon and paid relocation costs, on the theory that the payment of costs is only initial payment, subject to the Commission’s responsibility to make a later independent decision respecting cost allocation. The statutory language promoting private agreements would be thus emasculated.</p>

The Commission is authorized to allocate the costs of facility relocation in grade crossing cases where the parties havce not <em>mutually agreed upon and paid </em>the cost of relocation. The Commission, however, is not authorized to impair pre-existing contractual rights and duties except under limited circumstances. The appellants ask this Court to permit the Commission to abrogate the road occupancy contracts as a legitimate exercise of police power. Unless it appears, however, that these contracts adversely affect the public welfare, the legislature may not interfere with the cost allocation provisions. <em>Director General of Railroads v. West Penn Railways Co., </em><a href="/pa/281/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="281 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1087028" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0309-01">281 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20767" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="126 A. 767">126 Atl. 767</a> (1924). This Court has limited the contract abrogation ambit of the Commission to particular circumstances. The Commission’s power to set aside contracts does not apply to a contract which does not affect the common welfare by <em>directly </em>influencing rates or actual operations of the public utility. <em>Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Co. v. McKees Rocks Borough, </em><a href="/pa/287/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="287 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1099647" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0311-01">287 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20227" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="135 A. 227">135 Atl. 227</a> (1926). Affirming the permit con<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>tracts and their cost allocation provisions does not adversely affect the public welfare. Sustaining the contracts <em>might </em>necessitate a utility rate increase to defray the cost of facility relocation. Abrogating the contracts would require the City to bear the most substantial portion of the relocation costs. The additional cost to the City would be defrayed with tax revenue or an additional bond issue. In any case, the cost of facility relocation will finally be borne by the public. The net public detriment of sustaining the permit contracts, therefore, is negligible. Indeed, it is arguable that the concern for public welfare forbids the abrogation of contracts which impose the burden of relocation upon the utility companies: “The refusal to pay for the relocation of utilities ... is based upon the theory that inasmuch as public utility companies are not required to pay for the use of the highway, the Commonwealth has no obligation to them when it requires them to change their facilities because of changes which the Commonwealth desires to make in the highway. It might also be argued that if the Commonwealth was required to pay the cost of relocating utilities, it would become an element of consideration in each proposed construction, and in some cases the cost of such relocation might stand in the way of highway improvement.” <em>Department of Highways v.

It is true that our decision in <em>Philadelphia Electric </em>established that the “permits” in question are in fact contracts between the City and the utilities, but it does not follow that that case is controlling here on the question of whether the parties have “agreed upon” the proportions of cost to be respectively borne by them. There are two reasons why <em>Philadelphia Electric </em>does not control.</p>

Upon the institution of such proceedings, such contract or agreement shall not be effective until the commis<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>sion grants its approval thereof: Provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to contracts or agreements between any public utility and any municipal corporation which provide only for the furnishing of service at the regularly filed and published tariff rates.” When this section is read in conjunction with §411, it is readily apparent that any prior agreement must receive the imprimatur of the Commission before its jurisdiction relative to cost allocation will be ousted. Because §911 applies to <em>all </em>contracts between a municipality and a utility, not just to those involving some particular area of Commission concern such as crossings or rates, it is of no consequence that the permits in question did not relate particularly or expressly to crossings. When the Commission allocates costs for work done at a rail-highway crossing, it is exercising part of its delegated police power to insure that the work is performed compatibly with the public interest. To allow the parties to agree on the proportions of contribution without Commission approval or veto-power would frustrate this exercise of the police power. Such a view is consistent with our prior holdings that statutory requirements for the execution of contracts are mandatory, not merely directory. <em>Carnegie Natural Gas Co. v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/406/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="406 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1304863" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0134-01">406 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="176 A.2d 630">176 A. 2d 630</a> (1962).

In its role as wielder of the police power, the Commission also has a concern to insure that for their customers’ sake, utilities enter into contracts with municipalities which are not improvident as to the utilities. There is consequently no good reason to deny to utilities the right to enforce unfiled contracts, hut to allow, as the instant decision does, such enforcement by municipalities.</p>

This entire case is concerned with <em>crossings, </em>and the Commission, by reason of its statutory jurisdiction over rail-highway crossings, has necessarily been injected as a third party to the proceedings. Unlike <em>Philadelphia Electric, </em>the case at bar does not involve the relocation of utility lines longitudinally laid under or in City streets where no rail-highway crossing is involved. In that situation, where the Commission is not concerned, there is no reason why the permits even today may not be enforced in accordance with their terms.

The Commonwealth Court held, and the majority of this Court apparently agrees, that the proportions had been “paid by the interested parties” pursuant to the preliminary order of the Commission issued May 5, 1969, and that the final order of June 1, 1970 merely directed a 75 percent reimbursement by the City to the utility appellants.

This is not .to say, as the majority suggests, that the provision requiring payment is thereby rendering meaningless and the Commission is empowered to allocate costs in all cases as it sees fit. Bather, it interprets Section 411 (a) to cover those situations where payment is made <em>nolitionally </em>by the parties pursuant to their agreement, and not under mandate from the Commission. As that was not the case here, I would hold that the proportions had been neither “paid” nor “mutually agreed upon” within the meaning of the statute.</p>

    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[145,557,1153,1143]]]'>There can be no doubt that by §911 of the Public Utility Law the Commission has been given power to pass upon contracts between any public utility and any municipal corporation. Today’s decision limits the exercise of that power to contracts which “directly influence] rates or actual operations of the public utility”. (See the court’s opinion, supra, p. 410). In my judgment this limitation may seriously undermine effective utility regulation in Pennsylvania; what will not pass muster directly may now be attempted indirectly. To me, §911 itself is a clear indication that the legislature did not intend such a restrictive application of its delegation of the state’s police power to the Commission. As discussed above, by granting to the Commission power to review <em>all </em>contracts entered into between public utilities and municipalities, not just those involving rates and crossings, the legislature recognized the public interest inherent in all such public contracts and empowered the Commission, in cases where it has jurisdiction, to exercise the State’s police power over the entire contract field.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a>

This concern, however, is not properly directed to an attack on the power of the Commission in the first instance to make such an allocation; it should rather take the form of questioning whether the proportions decided upon represent a proper exercise of discretion. As this issue has not entered into the majority’s discussion, any extended treatment of it on my part would serve no useful purpose. I may say, however, that the 75:25 ratio adopted by the Commission seems to be justified under the evidence, and that no abuse of discretion or error of law by the Commission is apparent from the record.</p>
