Three days later respondent, Mack Truesdale, was arrested by the Philadelphia police and charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with the killing. Thereafter, on October 27,1971, Truesdale was afforded a preliminary hearing and, after the presentation of evidence, was bound over for the grand jury. At this hearing it was further determined that bail should be denied because the proof was evident and the presumption great, and the offense rose to the level of murder in the first degree, and pursuant to Article 1, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution the offense being a capital one was not bailable. On November 8, 1971, Truesdale petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for a writ of habeas corpus alleging he was improperly being detained; the petition was subsequently denied with the court finding that his detention was proper. On December 2, 1971, Truesdale was indicted on the charges of murder and conspiracy, in connection with the death of Blanche Buchler, by a <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>grand jury and is now awaiting trial on the indictments.</p>

This argument ignores the mandate of the Pennsylvania Constitution and also fails when analyzed pragmatically. Prior to the invalidation of the death penalty, there was a strong flight urge because of the possibility of an accused forfeiting his life, and the framers of our Constitution must have felt that if a person were accused of a crime and had to risk the possibility of receiving the death penalty or forfeiting <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>bail, he would obviously choose the latter. However, they did not feel the urge to flee was as great where the maximum penalty was life imprisonment, as indicated by the failure to draft the Constitution to read, bail may be denied in cases of “capital offenses or life imprisonment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Thus, with the maximum penalty for murder in the first degree being life imprisonment, we believe the urge to flee is diminished. There are a number of criminal offenses in the Commonwealth which carry a possible penalty of life imprisonment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> and the offenses have traditionally been bailable.</p>

As noted before, the right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused giving adequate assurance he or she will appear for trial. If upon proof shown, the court reasonably concludes the accused will not appear for trial regardless of the character or the amount of the bail, then in such an instance bail may properly be denied, regardless of the nature of the charges. The <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>burden, of proof is upon the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> This decision must be reached by the application of certain criteria, such as: (1) general reputation in the community; (2) past record; (3) past conduct while on bail; (4) ties to the community in the form of a job, family, or wealth. See Pa. R. Crim. P. 4005. However, the trial court must also consider that modern police methods, such as, exchange of photographs and fingerprints, act as a deterrent to flight.</p>

We realize this is truly a pressing problem and the rights of the public and of witnesses to be protected from harm is of the greatest concern, however, what the Commonwealth is really ashing us to do is provide for a system of preventive detention. This would be an unprecedented step on our part, and one that is fraught with constitutional problems in terms of due process. It would also be contrary to the whole foundation of our penal system, since our laws punish for past offense, rather than incarcerate a person to prevent future offenses. Moreover, the Commonwealth’s suggestion requires a presumption on our part that an accused is guilty, rather than innocent, and also that he will commit additional crimes if released on bail. Likewise, the Commonwealth’s suggestion indicates a lack of understanding of the purpose of the bail system. Bail was conceived as a means of securing the accused’s pres-</p>

The traditional decision to deny bail was not a means of keeping an accused confined to protect the public, it was a means of assuring he would appear at trial. In short, the Commonwealth is asking us to apply the procedure of granting or denying bail to a purpose it was not designed to fulfill, i.e., pretrial incarceration as a preventive form of punishment for an act unconsummated. In this regard, Mr. Justice Jackson, of the United States Supreme Court, sitting as a circuit justice once stated: “The Government’s alternative contention is that defendants, by misbehavior after conviction, have forfeited their claim to bail. Grave public danger is said to result from what they may be expected to do, in addition to what they have done since their conviction. If I assume that defendants are disposed to commit every opportune disloyal act helpful to Communist countries, it is still difficult to reconcile with traditional American law the jailing of persons by the courts because of anticipated but as yet uncommitted crimes. Imprisonment to protect society from predicted but unconsummated offenses is so unprecedented in this country and so fraught with danger of excesses and injustice that I am loath to resort to it . . .” <em>Williamson v.

The Court of Kings Bench had an unlimited power of admitting to bail for all offenses, including treason and murder; but bail was not demandable as a right. Of course, the Judicial discretion was exercised according to established rules. The object of the detention or imprisonment of the prisoner being to secure his forthcoming to abide the sentence of the law, the principle inquiry was, whether a recognizance would effect that end. In seeking an answer to this inquiry, the matters chiefly considered, were, the seriousness of the charge, the nature of the evidence, and the severity of the punishment Hence, when the offense was capital, and the evidence in support of it was strong, bail was denied because no pecuniary consideration would be likely to secure the attendance of the prisoner, to the probable loss of his life. And the same rule prevailed in offenses not capital, where the evidence was clear, and the punishment was, by a long and rigorous imprisonment; and, for the same reason.</p>

It is not necessary to refer to the Act of 1705. The Constitution itself defines the right. The clause in the Constitution of 1798, copied into our present Declaration of rights, provides that ‘all prisoners shall be bailable,, by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses, where the proof is evident or the presumption great.’ What is a capital offense within the meaning of this clause?

While there is logic to this argument and the result may well be a desirable one, it is untenable from a constitutional standpoint.

On the contrary, the spirit of the procedure is to enable them to stay out of jail until a trial has found them guilty. Without this conditional privilege, even those wrongly accused are punished by a period of imprisonment while awaiting trial and are handicapped in consulting counsel, searching for evidence and witnesses, and preparing a defense.” <a href="/us/342/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="342 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="641182" data-case-paths="/us/342/0001-01">Id. at 7-8</a>, <a href="/us/342/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="342 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="641182" data-case-paths="/us/342/0001-01">72 S.

In a choice between hazarding his life before a jury and forfeiting his or his sureties’ property, the framers of the many State Constitutions felt that an accused would probably prefer the latter. But when life was not at stake and consequently the strong flight-urge was not present, the framers obviously regarded the right to bail as imperatively present.” <a href="/citations/?q=61%20N.J.%20360" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="61 N.J. 360">61 N.
