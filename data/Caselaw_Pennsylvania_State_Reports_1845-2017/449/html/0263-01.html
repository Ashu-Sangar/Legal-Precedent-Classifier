After trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the punishment at life imprisonment. Subsequently, post trial motions were denied and sentence was imposed as the jury directed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[148,657,1150,931]]]'>About 2:30 p.m. on June 25, 1969, three young men were observed leaving the variety store involved in great haste and commotion. When the witnesses entered the store, the proprietor was found slumped on the floor and bleeding from the head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The witnesses immediately alerted the police and described the individuals seen leaving the store as black males, about eighteen years of age, and wearing dark clothing. Police in the area were notified of the occurrence and directed to watch for persons fitting the description given. Shortly thereafter, Davenport was taken into police custody several blocks from the crime site. The arresting officer testified he seized Davenport, a young black male, because he appeared “nervous”, was perspiring, and was carrying a white jacket over his arm which looked weighted. On inspection about twenty-seven dollars in change was found in the jacket.</p>

A timely pretrial motion to suppress this evidence had previously been denied. After carefully studying the record, we are convinced this evidence was the product of sustained police pressure which, under the circumstances, was tantamount to duress and hence its use at trial violated due process. Cf. <em>Rogers v.

As Mr. Justice O’Brien pointed out, while speaking for the Court in <em>Butler, </em>quoting from Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s opinion in <em>Culombe v.

Ct. 1860</a> (1961), there is no “single litmus-paper test” for determining if the statements of one accused of crime are voluntary or if such evolved from constitutionally impermissible forms of interrogation. In determining this issue all of the attending factors and circumstances must be considered and evaluated. The statements need <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>not be volunteered to meet constitutional requirements. Likewise, the fact that they result from police interrogation does not in itself proscribe their evidentiary use at trial. However, to be “voluntary” in the constitutional sense the statements must be the free choice of the maker. And if the maker’s will was overborne, either through physical or mental pressures, then the statement did not issue from a free choice. Cf. <em>Watts v. Indiana, </em><a href="/us/338/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="338 U.S. 49" data-case-ids="3946942" data-case-paths="/us/338/0049-01">338 U.S. 49</a>, <a href="/us/338/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="338 U.S. 49" data-case-ids="3946942" data-case-paths="/us/338/0049-01">69 S.

    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[162,1332,1149,754]]]'>After his arrest, Davenport was taken to the offices of the Homicide Division in the Police Administration Building for questioning.

Prom 3:5G p.m. until 8:50 p.m., with the exception of five short intervals of about ten minutes duration, he was subjected to the nearly constant questioning of as many as four police officers, sometimes alternating, sometimes together. During this period one of his hands was continuously handcuffed to a chair which was bolted to the floor. He was not given any food or drink and the chronology sheet prepared by the police doesn’t indicate he visited the “rest room.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

About 8:50 p.m. he admitted participating in the robbery, but stated the fatal shot was fired by one of his co-felons.</p>

This statement was completed at 11:45 p.m. Davenport then read and signed each page at 12:40 a.m. Following this, the statement (the questions by an officer and the answers by Davenport) was read into a tape recording device. However, the tapes could not be found or produced at the suppression hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

At the suppression hearing, Davenport’s counsel attempted to introduce testimony to show a relationship between the convulsion suffered by Davenport and his state of mind when the challenged statement was given. This testimony was to be elicited from a graduate-physician who examined Davenport in a hospital on June 26th. At the time of the examination, the physician was an intern in Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. At the time of trial, he was serving his residency in the same institution. The hearing court sustained the Commonwealth’s objection to this witness’s testimony on the basis he was not a qualified expert. The mere fact the witness was not licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania did not ipso facto render him incompetent as a matter of law. See <em>Clark v.

This is so not because such confessions are unlikely to be true but because the methods used to extract them offend an underlying principle in the enforcement of our criminal law: that ours is an accusatorial and not an inquisitorial system— a system in which the State must establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured and may not by coercion prove its charge against an accused out of his own mouth .... To be sure, confessions cruelly extorted may be and have been, to an unascertained extent, found to be untrustworthy. But the constitutional principle of excluding confessions that are not voluntary does not rest on this consideration. Indeed, in many of the cases in which the command of the Due Process Clause has compelled us to reverse state convictions involving the use of confessions obtained by impermissible methods, independent corroborating evidence left little doubt of the truth of what the defendant had confessed. Despite such verification, confessions were found to be the product of constitutionally impermissible methods in their inducement. Since a defendant had been subjected to pressures to which, under our accusatorial system, an accused should not be subjected, we were constrained to find that the procedures leading to his conviction had failed to afford him that due process of law which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.” Id at 540-1, 81 S.
