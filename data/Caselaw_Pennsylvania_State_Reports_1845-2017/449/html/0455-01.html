Subsequently, the Township filed an application in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster County for reimbursement in the amount of $29,102.90 to recover the cost of storm sewers and fireplugs installed at Township expense on the annexed territory between 1962 and 1966. These improvements were paid for out of general Township revenue as they were installed and at the time of the annexation, there was no outstanding indebtedness attributable to them. The Township based its claim on Section 308(a) of the Second Class Township Code which provides that whenever a portion of a Township has been annexed by a Borough, the Borough is liable to the Township for “the cost of sewer systems constructed by the township within fifteen years.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In maintaining that it owed nothing to the Township as a result of the annexation the Borough relied specifically on the language of Section 441 of the Borough Code: “In adjusting property and indebtedness [after an annexation] streets, <em>sewers and utilities shall not be considered </em>except to the extent that current and unpaid indebtedness was incurred for the construction and improvement thereof.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Admittedly there is more conflict between the provisions of the two Codes regarding reimbursement for municipal services than there was over the definition of freeholder. Moreover, whereas the Bor<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>ough Code is silent as to the definition of freeholder, Section 441 of the Code does contain a specific provision for the adjustment of indebtedness after the annexation has been finalized.</p>
