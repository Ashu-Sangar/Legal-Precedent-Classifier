The ordinance is binding upon all persons, including the Borough. The “underground wiring district” would be 300' in width (extending about two and one-half miles along the William Penn Highway [U.

The Act of April 28, 1903, P. L. 335, granted boroughs the power to define underground wire districts and to regulate the use of underground conduits. This language was re-enacted in the Act of June 12, 1913, P. L. 488, which also extended the Borough’s power to include telephone and telegraph companies. In that same year the legislature enacted the Public Service Company Law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> which created the Public Service Commission, the predecessor of the present Public Utility Commission. A consolidation of the various laws concerning boroughs was effected by the enactment of the Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 312: Chapter VI, Article XV, of this Act again restated the power of boroughs to compel and regulate underground wire facilities and retained the language of the 1913 Borough Act. In 1927, a comprehensive Borough Code was enacted:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> this Act retained the provisions of the prior borough acts relating to undergrounding and control of wires and codified them as Article XXIII, §§2301 through 2305.

      <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>Any other determination would clearly signal the end of unified utility regulation within this Commonwealth. The practical effect of allowing the Borough of Monroeville to compel public utilities to relocate their existing overhead wiring would be to permit a borough, free from any statewide considerations or prior approval by the Public Utility Commission, to require, as in this instance, the expenditure of over $1,000,000 by public utilities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> Obviously, these and similar expenditures would become part of the utilities’ rate base, and accordingly, would be reflected in increased consumer rates. It is equally obvious that to permit these higher rates to be imposed on consumers outside of the borough would be in effect allowing the borough, by its unilateral action, to influence rates outside its geographic boundaries. Thus, it would appear reasonable to assume that the rate-making authority could impose these increased rates solely upon those subscribers within the borough. These additional costs could make utility usage by these consumers exceedingly expensive.</p>
