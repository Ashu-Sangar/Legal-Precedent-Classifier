Appellant, Richard Porter, then 16 years of age, was one of four subsequently indicted for aggravated robbery and murder in connection with the incident. In May, 1970, a jury found Porter guilty of murder in the second degree but acquitted him of the charge of aggravated robbery. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to 6-20 years imprisonment. This appeal, raising four issues, followed. Because we decide them all adversely to appellant, the judgment of sentence below will be affirmed.</p>

At the conclusion of the interrogation, the officer who had taken the statement encountered Mrs. Porter in the waiting room, and took her in to see her son. Richard repeated the substance of his story to his mother, who expressed displeasure that her son had confessed and endeavored unsuccessfully, to contact an attorney. She forbade Richard to make a formal, signed statement.</p>

In so holding, we were relying upon another opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for four members of the United States Supreme Court (there was no majority opinion) in <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em><a href="/us/400/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="91 S.

Mr. Justice Stewart noted that the declarant’s statement in that case was spontaneous and also against his penal interest. These attributes, said Mr. Justice Stewart, “are indicia of reliability which have been widely viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant.” 400 U.S. at 89. In <em>Commonwealth v. Ransom, </em>the co-conspirator’s statement was held not to qualify under the Pennsylvania co-conspirator rule, since the robbery had been accomplished and the proceeds divided at the time the statements were made. Indeed, the statements were given to the police at a time when both accomplices were under arrest and in custody. The statements thus did not qualify as hearsay exceptions, and we had no occasion to explore the circumstances which would guarantee sufficient indicia of reliability under the test we announced.</p>

      <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>In several decisions since <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court has developed the standards to be applied in determining whether testimony admitted under a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule satisfies the Confrontation Clause. First, in <em>California v. Green, </em><a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">399 U.S. 149</a>, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">90 S. Ct. 1930</a> (1970), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause is not a codification of the hearsay rule. <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">Id. at 155-56</a>, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">90 S.

Evans, </em>supra, the admission of a statement by a co-conspirator to a cellmate which implicated the accused was held not to violate the Sixth Amendment. The statement, admitted under Georgia’s exception to the hearsay rule for declarations against penal interest, was proper because it “was spontaneous and it was against his penal interest to make it. These are <em>indieia of reliability </em>which have been widely viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant.” Id. at 89, <a href="/us/400/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="91 S. Ct. 210" data-case-ids="12046557" data-case-paths="/us/400/0074-01">91 S. Ct. at 220</a> (emphasis added).</p>

The spontaneous utterance exception likewise is founded on considerations of reliability: “The factor of special reliability is . . . furnished by the excitement which suspends the powers of reflection and fabrication. . ..
