Both of these young men were members of the Wallace Street gang.</p>

About one and a half hours later they were transferred in a police van to the Police Administration Building for questioning.</p>
    <p id="b611-3" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[127,603,1150,768]]]'>Fogan was first questioned beginning at 2:30 a.m. on June 19th for about one hour. The questions were of a general nature primarily aimed at ascertaining if Fogan knew anything about the homicide. (Since the Moroccans were the aggressors in the fight and the victims were members of the rival Wallace Street gang, the police at this time were of the impression that the Moroccans did the shooting.) In response to this questioning, Fogan said nothing incriminating. He was not warned of his constitutional rights before or during this questioning. When it was concluded, Fogan was detained in a small sub-interrogation room for several hours, but was not questioned. During this period he was fed but not provided with sleeping facilities.</p>

He was also fully advised of his constitutional rights including his right to remain silent and his right to have a lawyer present during the questioning to assist him without charge. Fogan then responsively indicated he understood his rights and was willing to answer questions without a lawyer being present; however, he did ask if any of his family “were out there” and was informed they were not. Immediately thereafter he admitted mistakenly shooting two of his own gang members while intending to hit the onrushing Moroccans. His version of the incident, given in response to the <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>officer’s questions, was then recorded in the form of a formal typewritten statement which when completed he read and signed. Following this Fogan read the contents of the statement into a tape recorder.</p>

He left school in the tenth grade and, according to the school records, had a verbal I.Q. of 84. In September 1968, he had suffered a gunshot wound in one eye resulting in the loss of sight in that organ. At the time herein involved, Fogan’s father was dead and his mother was in the hospital.</p>

Despite the Commonwealth’s protestations to the contrary, the record leads to no other conclusion but that, an arrest was effected, and that it was illegal because probable cause was lacking. At the time Fogan was taken into custody, the only possible grounds for probable cause was the fact that he was a known member of one of the gangs involved in the street fight. However, at this time the police had no information that he personally or the others arrested with him were among those who participated in the fight.</p>

Such a practice can only lead to the illegal and unjust detention of innocent persons and raise serious doubts in the minds of all good citizens as to whether or not the police live within the law they are charged with upholding. The Commonwealth’s position that Fogan’s police custody (before he confessed) was not an “arrest”, but merely the act of detaining and interviewing <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>possible material witnesses is belied by tbe facts and rejected by every pertinent legal decision.

Before he incriminated himself, he had full knowledge of his rights. There was absolutely no information obtained during the initial questioning which in any way influenced his self-incriminations seven and one-half hours later.

However, after a studious and thoughtful reading and re-reading of the record, we are not persuaded the trial court committed an error of law in finding Fogan was fully aware of his rights and knowingly and intelligently waived them.

In <em>Marabel, </em>appellant was arrested and questioned on three separate dates, May 6, May 15 and May 17. During the first two interrogations appellant was not advised of his <em>Mirwida </em>rights, but no confession was obtained. Appellant was released after each of these first two sessions. At the third session on May 17 he was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then finally confessed when confronted with some particularly damaging evidence. This Court held the confession admissible because “there was a break in the ‘stream of events’ ” which insulated the confession from the taint of the prior unlawful interrogations, on May 6 and 17. <em>Commonwealth v.

Harmon, </em><a href="/pa/440/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="440 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1932297" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0195-01">440 Pa. 195</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="269 A.2d 744">269 A. 2d 744</a> (1970). In <em>Harmon, </em>an eighteen-year old juvenile was arrested and interrogated continuously for eleven hours before he finally confessed. During the questioning Harmon was denied permission to see his family and subjected to several polygraph tests. In addition Harmon’s family and his attorney were not permitted to see him during the interrogation. Despite the fact that Harmon had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the beginning of the questioning, and once more after about eight hours, this Court held in that factual setting a confession extracted from an eighteen-year old was inadmissible. The Court there stated “[t]he facts found by the lower court, . . . disclose the use of tactics in the securing of. the challenged statement which we <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>cannot condone.” Id. at 199, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="269 A.2d 744">269 A. 2d at 746</a>. Here appellant was not even advised of Ms rights prior to the initial questioning, as in Harmon; he was never released from custody, as in <em>Marabel; </em>he asked to see his relatives; and only after seven hours of uninterrupted interrogation was he advised of his rights.</p>

The majority in its analysis of the circumstances appears to weigh only those favoring a voluntary confession. It ignores the fact that the seventeen-year old boy, with a lower than average I.Q., who had asked to see his relatives, was interrogated for a lengthy period of time while being held virtually incommunicado. Under these conditions there is serious doubt that this juvenile could actually understand the meaning of any <em>Miranda </em>warning given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> His confession tainted and influenced by the psychological effects of the preceding seven hours of unlawful custodial interrogation was clearly involuntary.</p>
