In <em>Koolvent </em>the taxpayer sued for interest from the date the lower court rendered a judgment against the School District of Pittsburgh for a refund of mercantile taxes. The Superior Court granted what the taxpayer asked for and was not asked to decide if the taxpayer could receive interest from the date the tax was paid and demand for refund made. Moreover, the Superior Court in <em>Koolvent </em>distinguished those cases where the lower court determines the amount of refund from those cases where the amount of refund <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>is not in question. The Superior Court concluded that the taxpayer paid taxes which <em>“the law did not impose in any amount” </em>and that the taxing authorities “were using money to which they never had a legal right.” <a href="/pa-super/192/0650-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="192 Pa.

Similarly, the question of when the improper detention occurred was not raised in <em>Girard. </em>There the taxpayer discovered in June 1946 that he had erroneously paid a 1934 tax up until 1946. The taxpayer, however, demanded interest from March 1, 1946. The court by awarding interest from March 1, 1946, again only did what the taxpayer asked.</p>
    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[141,987,1152,1025]]]'>Here the taxpayer has asked that interest be computed from the date of payment and demand for refund.

That the taxpayer’s money was improperly detained and demand for refund made should be sufficient to justify a court’s exercise of its equity powers. Here, however, the taxpayer paid the taxes promptly once they were assessed; inflation has deteriorated the value of the dollar that was improperly detained by the City and School District; and the City and School Districts, never having any right to the money, were able to borrow less or invest the money. Since the City and School District benefited from the use of the taxpayer’s money, it is only fair that the taxpayer receive simple interest for the period the money was improperly detained.</p>
