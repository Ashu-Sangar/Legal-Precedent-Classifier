Ct. 1845</a> (1972), compels dissent. For as the Court said in <em>Jackson-. “We hold, consequently, that a person changed by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.” </em>The Court <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>continued: “If it is determined that this is not the case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant. Furthermore, even if it is determined that the defendant probably soon will be able to stand trial, his continued commitment must be justified by progress toward that goal. In light of differing state facilities and procedures and a lack of evidence in this record, we do not think it appropriate for us to attempt to prescribe arbitrary time limits. We note, however, that petitioner Jackson has now been confined for three and one-half years on a record that sufficiently establishes the lack of a substantial probability that he will ever be able to participate fully in a trial.” <a href="/us/406/0715-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="406 U.S. 715" data-case-ids="6173472" data-case-paths="/us/406/0715-01">Id.</a> <a href="/us/406/0715-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="406 U.S. 715" data-case-ids="6173472" data-case-paths="/us/406/0715-01">406 U.S. at 738-39</a>, 92 g.

Appellant has been a patient since 1953; however, having been committed under the predecessor to Section 408 of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Act of October 20, 1966, Spec.
