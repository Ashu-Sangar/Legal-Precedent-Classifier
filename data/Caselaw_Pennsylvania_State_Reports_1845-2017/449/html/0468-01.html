The police, summoned by an aunt of the deceased, arrived on the premises at 8:30 a.m., where they found the victim’s body, lying face up on the bed with bruises around her neck and face and with foam around her mouth.</p>
    <p id="b527-8" data-blocks='[["BL_527.15",527,[120,1834,1151,479]],["BL_528.1",528,[203,330,1155,263]]]'>On the basis of circumstantial evidence, the jury found appellant, Bobert Davis, guilty of first degree murder. Appellant admitted that he had spent the entire night in the Stirling’s apartment, allegedly waiting for Mrs. Stirling, who had gone out with a boyfriend, and that he had been admitted to the apartment by the victim. Mrs. Stirling testified that when she returned home at 1:30 a.m., the appellant threatened to kill her. She claimed that she attempted to check on <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>the welfare of her children, but appellant held up a sheet partially obscuring the decedent so that Mrs. Stirling did not suspect anything until, still in the company of appellant, she discovered the decedent’s body the following morning.</p>

    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[202,986,1155,369]]]'>At the trial of appellant, the Commonwealth sought to show that the victim had been killed before 1:30 a.m., but that this fact had been concealed from Mrs. Stirling. The appellant’s theory was apparently that Vintress had been killed by an intruder sometime after 1:30 a.m., during which time appellant was, at all times, with Mrs. Stirling.</p>

This theory was supported by evidence that acid phosphastase, an enzyme produced by the male during ejaculation, was found in the foam in the victim’s mouth and by evidence that semen stains were found on the victim’s bed linen and on the pajamas and panties she was wearing at the time of her death, as well as on appellant’s shorts. Although appellant, by vigorous cross-examination, established that since acid phosphastase is also produced in the digestion of certain green vegetables and no sperm was discovered in the foam, the presence of semen in the victim’s mouth was not clearly established; the appellant did not really contest the Commonwealth’s theory that the victim had been murdered pursuant to an attempt to commit some sort of sexual abuse. Instead, appellant tried to show that the Commonwealth had not <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>linked Mm to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

This is not a case where the court may be arrogating to itself the jury’s fact-finding function by telling the jury that it believes there is no evidence of passion and provocation such as would reduce a murder to manslaughter. Nor is this a case where a defendant may be penalized because he completely denied an intentional killing rather than claim mitigating circumstances surrounded it. Instead, it is a case where any evidence of passion or provocation would be irrelevant. The record clearly shows that whoever committed this murder did so pursuant to an attempt to commit rape or sodomy on the victim. Since rape is one of the enumerated felonies, a homicide committed in the perpetration of this crime is a first degree murder. Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, §1,18 P.S. §4701. The malice necessary to make a homicide murder is implied from the presence of the intent to commit the felony. The presence of passion or provocation cannot negate this malice. The fact that, at the time the killing was committed, the rapist may have been in a state of passion, perhaps out of rage at his victim’s resistance or fear that his felony would be discovered, would make no difference. If he had the culpability to commit the rape, then, when he killed in the furtherance of that felony, he is deemed to have killed with malice. See <em>Commonwealth v. Meleskie, </em><a href="/pa/278/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="278 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1080536" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0383-01">278 Pa. 383</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20310" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="123 A. 310">123 A. 310</a> (1924).</p>

As pointed out in the writer’s <em>Matthews </em>dissent, because the choice whether or not to charge is discretionary with the trial judge, and he has been furnished with no objective standards for his guidance, the challenged practice offends due process; because the practice denies the same treatment to similarly situated defendants who happen to stand before differently disposed judges, it violates the equal protection of the laws.</p>

Thus the trial courts are still left with uninstructed discretion as to when they will or will not advert in their charges to the manslaughter possibility, and in what terms.</p>

If their power to return an illogical verdict did not reach to felony-murder cases, the rationale of my colleagues who favor affirmance might stand up, but this is not the case. Voluntary manslaughter is as much a lesser included offense of a felony-murder type of first degree murder as it is of the common law variety of intentional and premeditated first degree murder. Thus had the jury in the present case returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the verdict would have been accepted, notwithstanding the explicit instruction of the court. Moreover, the illogical verdict which reflects jury sympathy or extenuating circumstances is not necessarily to be condemned merely because death occurs in the commission of a felony. Is the accused in a murder where death results from a heart attack during a purse snatching any less deserving of jury sympathy than the hireling who kills in cold blood?</p>
