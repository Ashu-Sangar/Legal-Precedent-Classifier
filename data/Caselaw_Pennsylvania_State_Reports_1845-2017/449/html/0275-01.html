The postmortem examination revealed that the cause of death had been multiple stab wounds including two which penetrated the heart. Mrs. Rucker testified that on November 11, 1962 at approximately five or six p.m., while in her home at 1922 W. Paige Street, she heard the decedent scream, “Mrs. Rucker, help me please”. After running to her front door, she stated that she saw the appellant on the pavement, stabbing the decedent in the chest. The knife was subsequently found on the highway in front of 1918 Paige Street and was determined to contain human bloodstains. Upon his arrest, the appellant admitted the stabbing to the arresting officer. Later, during his confinement, he attempted to hang himself. At the trial, appellant testified that he had no memory of the stabbing incident or the circumstances that led up to it. The defense also introduced into evidence the records of the Philadelphia General Hospital which showed that the appellant had been admitted on November 12, 1962 and was discharged one month later. The initial diagnosis was “possible psychosis”. The diagnosis upon discharge was “no psychosis evident”.</p>

A reading of the record of the post-conviction hearing persuades us that this objection lacks merit and does not require a detailed analysis to dispose of the issue. The findings of the court below are not to be disturbed unless they have no support in the record. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant cites as a basis of this charge his trial attorney’s failure: To offer evidence reducing the offense to voluntary manslaughter; to move for a new trial; to introduce medical evidence of psychosis; and to request a pre-sentence investigation. This Court has stated, “Our task in cases of this nature therefore encompasses both an independ<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>ent review of the record, . . . and an examination of counsel’s stewardship of the now challenged proceedings in light of the available alternatives .... We cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, that our inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interest. The test is <em>not </em>whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis.” (Citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
