Havens and Walsh were given general testamentary powers of appointment, with gifts over, in default of exercise of the powers, to their issue.

The test to apply in order to determine whether such inseparability exists has been variously stated,—sometimes that the criterion is the ‘main and dominant purpose of the testator’ (Johnston’s Estate, <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>, 192, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%20879" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="39 A. 879">39 A. 879</a>, 883), other times that the inquiry should be directed to ascertaining whether ‘the striking down of the void gifts would, in vital matters, so emasculate his [the testator’s] plan of distribution, as to render it reasonably certain he would not have made the will in the way he did had he known it could not be sustained in the respects in which it must be set aside.’ <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>(McCaskey’s Estate, <a href="/pa/293/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="293 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1111154" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0497-01">293 Pa. 497</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20209" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="143 A. 209">143 A. 209</a>, 213). In other words, would the testator probably have desired that all the limitations of the trust should stand or fall together? Is the ultimate limitation apparently so essential to his dispositive scheme that it can be inferred that, if it were to be declared invalid, he would not have wanted the prior limitations to continue in existence?”</p>

The life estates have a vitality of their own in the testator’s testamentary plan. The designated life tenants were logical objects of his beneficence, and not merely conduits through which he could postpone the ultimate distribution of his estate. The testator’s intent was to give his son a life income from approximately one-half<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> of his estate and to give smaller life incomes to Walsh and Havens with the ultimate distribution to lie in their control rather than the son’s control.

We struck down the life estates and held that the testator’s dominant intent was to tie up the principal for a period beyond that permitted by the Rule; here there was an expressed intent by the donee that the principal be distributed no later than at the deaths of Havens and Walsh. In <em>Edwards Estate, </em>both the ultimate remainders and the life estates for the grandchildren of the named beneficiaries violated the Rule; here all the life estates are valid and only Walsh’s, not Havens’, general testamentary power of appointment is invalid.

The present life estate of the son would be affected by any invalidity of the future interests if the life estate could merge with any interest the son may have in the principal as a result of the invalidity. We agree with the lower court that, even if the son has a vested remainder in the principal, the spendthrift provision prevents the life estate from merging with the remainder.

In rejecting this argument, we need not decide whether the son’s interest in the principal, if the future interests violate the Eule, is an equitable interest. This Court has stated categorically that “a life estate under a spendthrift trust will not coalesce or merge with an estate in remainder.” <em>Bosler Estate, </em><a href="/pa/378/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="378 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1250882" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0333-01">378 Pa. 333</a>, 336, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.2d%20443" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="107 A.2d 443">107 A. 2d 443</a>, 444 (1954), citing <em>Moser’s Estate. </em>The general rule is that merger can only take place where the interests vesting in the same person are of the same character; either both legal or both equitable. <em>Dickson Estate, </em><a href="/pa/378/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="378 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1250862" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0048-01">378 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20156" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="105 A.2d 156">105 A. 2d 156</a> (1954). This does not mean that merger is mandatory when the interests are either both legal or both equitable even though the creation of one of the estates requires that it should remain distinct. Where the purpose of the trust requires the trust’s continuance, we cannot terminate the trust by allowing merger. This applies regardless of whether the life beneficiary of a spendthrift trust acquires an equitable or legal remainder. IV Scott on Trusts, §337.2 (3d ed. 1967). Since there would be no merger of the son’s life estate with any interest he would receive by a determination that the future interests violated the Eule, we need not subject the testator’s exercise of his general testamentary power of appointment to the Eule at this time.</p>
