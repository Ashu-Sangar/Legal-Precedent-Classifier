        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nIn 1962, following a jury trial in the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Allegheny County, the appellant was convicted of first-degree murder. The jury fixed the penalty at death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court, Commonwealth v. Ross, 413 Pa. 35, 195 A. 2d 81 (1963). Following denial of several \u201chabeas corpus\u201d petitions not germane to this proceeding, by both the Federal Courts and this Court, appellant filed the present petition in 1969, pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, contending that the jury which convicted and sentenced him to death was selected in violation of the principles announced in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). Following an evidenitary hearing, appellant\u2019s petition was denied. This appeal followed.\nInasmuch as the United States Supreme Court, in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), has ruled that the imposition of the death penalty under statutes such as the one in which the death penalty was imposed upon appellant is violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, it is unnecessary for us to consider appellant\u2019s claim of noncompliance with the Witherspoon standard. The United States Supreme Court, in Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 800 (1972), quoting from Witherspoon, stated: \u201cNor finally, does today\u2019s holding render invalid the conviction, as opposed to the sentence, in this or any other case. The sentence of death, however, may not now be imposed.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Bradley, 449 Pa. 19, 295 A. 2d 842 (1972).\nThe sentence of death is vacated and appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment.\nThe former Mr. Chief Justice Bell and the late Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.\nAct of Juno 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7701, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a74703.",
