        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nOn January 22, 1958, appellant, Charles R. Chase, was found guilty by a jury of the first-degree murder of his wife. The jury fixed the penalty at life imprisonment. A motion for a new trial was timely filed and subsequently denied. Commonwealth v. Chase, 73 Dauphin 138 (1958). No appeal was then taken from the judgment of sentence.\nAppellant subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County on September 7, 1965. Com. ex rel. Chase v. Myers, 84 Dauphin 198 (1965). The Dauphin County Court opinion was affirmed by this Court on September 27, 1966. Com. ex rel. Chase v. Myers, 423 Pa. 629, 222 A. 2d 597 (1966). Appellant then pursued his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Federal Courts. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied his petition on April 13,1967. United States v. Rundle, 266 F. Supp. 487 (M.D. Pa. 1967). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit refused to grant a certificate of probable cause, U. S. ex rel. Chase v. Rundle, 3d Cir. Misc. Rec. No. 733 (1967), and the Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari on January 25, 1968, Chase v. Rundle, 390 U.S. 928 (1968).\nOn February 26, 1968, appellant filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition averring, inter alia, that he did not know he had the right to have counsel appointed without cost to him to take an appeal. On May 7, 1968, the Public Defender of Dauphin County was appointed to represent appellant, and a motion for a new trial was filed and argued before the Dauphin County Court. On April 27, 1970, that court rendered an opinion dismissing the motion. Appellant now appeals from the judgment of sentence.\nAppellant\u2019s sole allegation is that one of the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witnesses, appellant\u2019s son, who was twelve years old at the time of trial, had been told how to testify by the district attorney before trial.\nAs evidence in support of this allegation, appellant has attached to his brief an affidavit by his son, Charles Alonzo Chase, which states:\n\u201cIt is my intention to make known that during the trial of Mr. Chase, my father, I was isolated along with my two younger sisters and my mother\u2019s immediate family in a meeting room with the District Attorney who was handling the case.\u201d\n\u201cDuring this pre-trial conference, my sisters and I were told that we would he asked certain questions by the District Attorney and should respond with the right answers that we went over together with the rest of the family. Although my sisters were involved, a great deal depended upon my testimony because I was the eldest at age twelve.\u201d\n\u201cThe testimony that I have given is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\nAppellant argues that this affidavit, when considered with his petition, entitles him to a hearing under \u00a79 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-9. Section 9 provides: \u201cIf a petition alleges\nfacts that if proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues raised in the petition or answer. However, the court may deny a hearing if the petitioner\u2019s claim is patently frivolous and is without a trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner.\u201d\nAppellant argues that his son\u2019s testimony was crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s showing of the premeditation necessary to support a first-degree murder conviction. However, while it is true that the son did testify to previous threats made by appellant to his wife and a previous use of a gun to support those threats, at least three other witnesses also testified concerning appellant\u2019s previous threats to kill his wife.\nMoreover, Charles Alonzo Chase\u2019s affidavit does not indicate that he committed perjury at his father\u2019s trial. It only indicates that he and the district attorney had discussed his testimony before trial and that the district attorney had told him to respond \u201cwith the right answers.\u201d\nEven if true, this allegation would not entitle appellant to a new trial.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nAct of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-1, et seq.",
