        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County, sitting as the Commonwealth Court, 3affirming the Board of Finance and Revenue\u2019s settlement of appellant\u2019s liability under the Corporate Net Income Tax for the tax year which terminated December 31, 1963.\nThe sole question involved here is whether appellant\u2019s receipts from its contracts with advertisers whose advertisements were placed on outdoor billboards situated in this Commonwealth are to be regarded as \u201crentals . . . from property situated . . . within this Commonwealth\u201d for purposes of the Corporate Net Income Tax. If the receipts are regarded as such \u201crentals,\u201d the receipts must be included in the numerator of the third fraction, better known as the \u201cgross receipts\u201d fraction, of the formula that was employed under the Corporate Net Income Tax Act to determine the tax liability of those corporations whose entire business is not transacted in Pennsylvania. We believe that appellant has not met its burden of establishing the invalidity of the Board of Finance and Revenue\u2019s settlement of its tax liability. Accordingly we affirm the order of the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County.\nAppellant and the Commonwealth submitted this ease to the court below on a stipulation of facts. That stipulation reveals that appellant owns certain road signs and leases as lessee certain other road signs [apparently referred to in the trade as bulletins] and locations therefore in Pennsylvania. Appellant, during the year in question, made contracts with advertisers for the placement of advertisements on billboards located in Pennsylvania. According to these contracts, appellant agreed to take all actions necessary to place and maintain the advertisements on the bulletins, including the payment of all lease rentals, taxes, and license fees.\nIn addition to the activities specified in the contracts, it was stipulated that appellant also performs the folloAving for its advertiser-customers:\n\u201c(a) Prepares sketches and full size samples of the proposed sign, including the idea for the arrangement of words and pictures and artwork pertaining thereto.\n(b) Makes traffic surveys and recommends quantities of signs needed to give adequate advertising coverage of the advertiser\u2019s markets Avithout oversaturation.\n(c) Works with advertiser in testing the effectiveness of the media in certain markets by traffic surveys, etc.\n(d) Fabricates and/or purchases the signs parts.\u201d\nIt was also stipulated that: \u201cThe advertisers have no right of possession of the bulletins or signs or the land on which same were located. The sole use of the bulletins or billboards is the placement of advertisements thereon.\u201d\nAppellant contends that the receipts from its contracts Avith the advertisers are not rentals from property, but rather represent payment for services performed by the appellant in the conduct of its business. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the receipts are \u201crentals\u201d from appellant\u2019s property\u2014 i.e., appellant\u2019s billboards. If appellant\u2019s contention is correct, its Corporate Net Income Tax liability for 1963 will be reduced by $1,173.38.\nThe question of whether appellant\u2019s receipts should be regarded as \u201crentals\u201d from property or as income from \u201cservices\u201d performed is not an easy one, for most business receipts represent a mixture of return for some services performed and of return on property owned. For example, a corporation that owns a large apartment building often provides to its tenants, in addition to the actual physical premises, services such as trash removal, security guards, gardening, etc. However, common sense indicates that in such a landlord-tenant arrangement the receipts from the tenants would represent primarily a return on the physical structure owned rather than compensation for services rendered as a part of the tenancy arrangement.\nAt the other end of the spectrum would be an accounting firm. In part the firm\u2019s fees could be regarded as a return on its investment in its business property\u2014i.e., the firm\u2019s typewriters, dictaphones, office furniture, and calculators\u2014but it is obvious that accountants\u2019 fees represent primarily compensation for services rendered.\nIn the case at hand, it is clear that appellant owns certain bulletins which it makes available to its advertiser-customers. It is also clear that appellant renders certain services to advertisers such as preparing advertising copy and making market surveys. However, appellant has not offered evidence to establish that its receipts represent primarily compensation for services rendered.\nIt is a well-established principle of tax law that a regularly made tax assessment is presumed to be valid. In fact, we have specifically held that the taxpayer has the burden of showing that the Commonwealth\u2019s computation of his Corporate Net Income Tax is incorrect. Commonwealth v. R. S. Noonan, Inc., 419 Pa. 411, 417, 213 A. 2d 787, 790 (1965). Since appellant has not met its burden of establishing that its receipts represent primarily compensation for services rendered, appellant\u2019s challenge to the tax settlement formulated by the Board of Finance and Revenue must be rejected.\nThe judgment of the Dauphin Common Pleas Court is affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nThis appeal is taken pursuant to Section 203 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, art. II, \u00a7203, 17 P.S. \u00a7211.203 (Supp. 1972).\nThe appeal to the Dauphin Common Pleas Court was filed September 22, 1967, before that court\u2019s jurisdiction as the Commonwealth Court was assumed by the new Commonwealth Court. However, the final order of the Dauphin Common Pleas Court in this matter was not issued until August 18, 1971.\nAct of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, \u00a7\u00a71 et seq., as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 \u00a73420a et seq. This act was repealed by Section 411 of the Tax Reform Act of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P. 1\u00a1. 6, art. IV, \u00a7411, 72 P.S. \u00a77411 (Supp. 1972). However, the Act of May 16, 1935, still determines liability for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 1971. See Act of March 4, 1971, P. L. 6, art. IV, \u00a7412, 72 P.S. \u00a77412 (Supp. 1972).\nAct of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, \u00a72, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a73420b, 2(c).\nId. \u00a73420b 2(c) (3).\nSee, e.g., Deitch Co. v. Board of Property Assessment, 417 Pa. 213, 221, 209 A. 2d 397, 402 (1965) ; 36 P.L.E. Taxation \u00a7\u00a7242, 247.\nSee Commonwealth v. Hellertown Mfg. Co., 438 Pa. 134, 140-41, 264 A. 2d 382, 386 (1970) ; Commonwealth v. Stretchnit, Inc., 2 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 270, 273-74, 273 A. 2d 750, 751 (1971).",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy:\nI do not dispute the proposition that this regularly made tax assessment is presumed to be valid, Deitch Co. v. Board of Property Assessment, 417 Pa. 213, 209 A. 2d 397 (1965), nor the proposition that where the assessment is based upon a certain view of the operative facts, the burden must rest on the taxpayer to demonstrate that the facts are not as the authorities have found them, Commonwealth v. R. S. Noonan, Inc., 419 Pa. 411, 213 A. 2d 787 (1965). Neither of these principles, however, can be said to control this case. The majority opinion, in my view, misapplies both and rides roughshod over a legislative enactment regarding construction of tax statutes. I accordingly dissent.\nThe Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act, May 16,1935, P. L. 208, \u00a71 et seq., as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a73420a et seq., provides that \u201crentals . . . from property situated . . . within this Commonwealth\u201d shall be included in the numerator of the gross receipts, or third fraction used in determining taxable net income of a corporation all of whose business is not transacted in the Commonwealth. The majority correctly perceives that the issue is solely that of interpreting the word \u201crentals\u201d as used in this phrase. There is no dispute as to the operative facts\u2014the manner in which the appellant corporation uses its Pennsylvania situated billboards, or \u201cbulletins,\u201d in its business\u2014and hence the majority\u2019s citation to cases which deal with the placement of the burden of proof as regards operative facts is inapposite.\nThe Statutory Construction Act, Sec. 58(3), Act of M!ay 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 P.S. \u00a7558(3), provides that provisions of a law imposing taxes shall be strictly construed against the taxing authority. See, e.g., Mastrangelo v. Buckley, 433 Pa. 352, 250 A. 2d 447 (1969) ; Commonwealth v. High Welding Co., 428 Pa. 545, 239 A. 2d 377 (1968); Commonwealth v. Rieck Inc., 419 Pa. 52, 213 A. 2d 277 (1965); Panther Valley Television Co. v. Borough of Summit Hill, 376 Pa. 375, 102 A. 2d 699 (1954). It is admitted in the Court\u2019s opinion that interpretation of the word \u201crentals\u201d is not easy, and that, as viewed by the majority, the line must be drawn at some ill-defined point lying somewhere between income received for rendition of personal services and income received from the \u201crental\u201d of property. Having admitted that there is considerable uncertainty in the reach of this legislatively chosen word, I cannot understand how the issue can then be resolved against the taxpayer. We have always held that \u201cany doubt or uncertainty as to the imposition of a tax must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rieck Inc., supra.\nThe preferable manner in which to decide this case, in my opinion, would be to recognize that the legislature has directed us to construe a word \u201caccording to [its] common and approved usage.\u201d 46 P.S. \u00a7533. The common, almost invariable usage of the word \u201crent\u201d or \u201crental\u201d is to describe the consideration paid by a tenant or occupant of real estate for the right of possession, use and occupation of the property. See Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968); 48 Am. Jur. 2d, Landlord & Tenant, \u00a7514. It is a stipulated fact in the present case that appellant\u2019s advertisers have no right of possession of the bulletins or sign boards; the sole use of the signs is the placement of advertisements upon them, but this is done by appellant. The majority\u2019s construction of the word \u201crentals\u201d as denoting income earned primarily by virtue of the ownership of tangible property and secondarily through the rendition of personal services may not be out of place in a textbook on economics; it is, however, a far cry from the \u201ccommon and approved\u201d usage the legislature must be held to have intended.\nIn another context we have recently stated, although the statement may not have been necessary to the decision, that income received from outdoor advertising customers was not to be considered as rent. Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Co. Appeal, 440 Pa. 321, 324, 272 A. 2d 163 (1970). I am unable to perceive any compelling reason to hold the opposite in this case, especially in light of the legislative direction to resolve uncertainty in favor of the taxpayer.",
