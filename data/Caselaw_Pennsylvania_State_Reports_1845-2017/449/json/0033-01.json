        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nIn 1985, following a jury trial in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, the appellant was convicted of first-degree murder. The jury fixed the penalty at death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court, Commonwealth v. Lopinson, 427 Pa. 284, 234 A. 2d 552 (1967). The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded to this Court for reconsideration in light of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). This Court, in turn, remanded the case to the court below for a determination of the Witherspoon issue. The court below found no violation of the standards enunciated in Wither-spoon and filed a report to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to that effect. Appellant filed exceptions to the report.\nInasmuch as the United States Supreme Court, in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), has ruled that the imposition of the death penalty under statutes such as the one in which the death penalty was imposed upon appellant is violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, it is unnecessary for us to consider appellant\u2019s claim of noncompliance with the Witherspoon standard. The Supreme Court, in Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 800 (1972), quoting from Witherspoon, stated: \u201cNor finally, does today\u2019s bolding render invalid the conviction, as opposed to the sentence, in this or any other case. The sentence of death, however, may not now be imposed.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Bradley, 449 Pa. 19, 295 A. 2d 842 (1972).\nThe sentence of death is vacated and appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment.\nThe former Mr. Chief Justice Bell and the former Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the decision of this case.\nAct of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7701, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a74701.",
